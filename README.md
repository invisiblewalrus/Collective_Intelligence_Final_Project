# Collective Intelligence Final Project

## Project Description

This project was built by Mark Coretsopoulos, Andy Han, and Jeremy Krovitz as part of their Collective Intelligence (COMP 440) final course project at Macalester College during the spring 2019 semester.

Perform sentiment analysis on streamed tweets about movies before they are released in theater, and see whether if there is a correlation between sentiment and opening weekend performance. For example, does a strong prevalence of positive tweets indicate a financially successful performance in the opening theater? Or, does a more mixed reaction to a movie’s release indicate something else different entirely? Also, how does a movie’s reception on twitter match up to both critical and audience reviews on review aggregate sites such as Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic?

The project will curate and collect an original dataset of tweets about movies that will be released between March 29, 2019 and April 19, 2019. We will also look at literature about sentiment analysis of tweets about films to serve as the research foundation for our project.

## Movies Analyzed
• Week 1 (3/29) - Dumbo

• Week 2 (4/5) - Shazam, Pet Sematary, The Haunting of Sharon Tate, Best of Enemies

• Week 3 ( 4/12) - Hellboy, Missing Link

• Week 4 (4/19) - The Curse of La Llorona, Breakthrough, Little Woods
