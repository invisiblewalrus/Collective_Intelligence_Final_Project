"1","Once your eyes are open, even things you already “know” look different. #vegan"
"2","The issue of dedicating more or less space to indie films aside, no self-respecting adult should be addressing most major studio releases at this point. Like, there shouldn't have been any ""criticisms"" of Dumbo. Not one. And literally nobody needs to write anything about Shazam!"
"3","listen here you dumbo, you are so fucking funny and im grateful for you i ***e, i hope you learn how to do maths, and thank you for saying happy birthday and singing hit or miss also can you please help me get a gf? please and thanks.
also you are cute or wtv"
"4","@Variety I didn’t enjoy the focus on the human story rather than Dumbo and the other animals. I missed the circus mouse that supported Dumbo. I especially HATED the casting choice of those children, especially the girl. No passion or expression. Visually? Perfect. Adult actors? Great.1/"
"5","Hahaha so Sharmila Farooqi wasn't the only dumbo to argue that SKMH should be renamed"
"6","@HillaryMonahan @aleksappleton I am STOKED to go see Us, but absolutely refuse to see Dumbo because it is way too fucking disturbing."
"7","@ameriporean I LOVE dumbo but I’m very much not a fan of the live action remake trend"
"8","I honestly can't remember if Dumbo has a voice in the original cartoon. All the other animals have voices. But does Dumbo?
Don't look up clips, give me a solid yes or no."
"9","whoever irene went to see dumbo with must have laughed so much seeing irene birthdays posters plastered everywhere around the mall...."
"10","So Dumbo didn’t do well at the box office. I can’t imagine why– they just took one of the most emotionally disturbing animated films and added an hour of plot, dour CGI, and a weirdly-humanoid elephant that looks like a melted child version of Stubby Kaye."
"11","I am hoping that Disney is going to start to take a look at all these remakes and the reception of #Dumbo and reevaluates the whole thing."
"12","On another note... lost count of date # but when you’re a hustler &amp; work hard.... you have my attention! <U+0001F60D> Excited for our movie night tomorrow! #Dumbo"
"13","@PaulaAbdul @Dumbo @Disney @AmazingLovelyGM I saw this and must think about you<U+0001F418><U+2764> How is the elephant that you adopted NDotto was it right? Elephants are magic"
"14","@Dumbo is amazing #ColinFarrell is always brilliant @DannyDeVito and @MichaelKeaton as-well especially these 2 first time in screen together since #batmanreturns it’s my favourite Disney live action remake to date even for me better than #BeautyAndTheBeast"
"15","@KyleOVox I've run into similar folks in real life. A friend once commented that Dumbo was dumb with no real reason WHY and my Dad complains that it's too sad. It's always nice when you run into people that like it though/"
"16","@chuckwoolery @gatewaypundit Not true. Number four. While still respectable, beat by Dumbo, US, and Captain Marvel. Marvel, by the way, was at $22 million in 3rd, while Unplanned was at $6.1 million."

"21","And BTW, the kids at the cinema I went to LOOOOVED #Dumbo"
"22","Baby #Dumbo was ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!!!!!! Unfortunately the film didn’t live up to his cuteness."
"23","I was pleasantly surprised and amazed that the blatant the Vandemere=Disney and anti-capitalism messaging in #Dumbo got by the House of Mouse. What benevolent overlords....."
"24","#Dumbo wasn’t a disaster or bad film (it’s one of #TimBurton’s better films in a loooooong time, but that’s not saying much), but it dragged and I had some major qualms with flat line readings from the cast."
"25","uh, stop being dumb for a second. It’s a Tim Burton’s movie. Not for kids. Yes it’s disney and dumbo and ? If your kid is 8, he/she probably won’t like watching the nightmare before christmas. So? what is your point. Also, maybe if parents weren’t *this* dumb they’ll get it"
"26","irene: huffs and puffs about being called dumbo
also irene: goes along with it anyway because she loves us"
"27","@envinyon to be fair, the original Dumbo is frightening"
"28","The DUMBO remake was written by the screenwriter of the american GHOST IN THE SHELL in case y'all were wondering"
"29","Yes. 
I've just cried watching the new #Dumbo and I don't care"
"30","Ok I know it’s fake but the new Dumbo movie is cruel I hate it"
"31","My stepdad won't come to see Dumbo with me because he's gonna cry ffs if he's gonna then obviously I will"
"32","@PaulsMovieTrip @Dumbo @DisneyStudios Dumbo was always one of my favorites.  I just cry so many times when I watch it. The older I get the worse my crying in movies gets. I haven’t seen the new Dumbo for this exact reason. If I cried 2-3 times in the 60 minute classic, just how much more will I cry in this one!!  <U+0001F418>"
"33","I mean it was cute but I was expecting more"
"34","Catch me at the theater when this comes out"
"35","@LilaGraceRose @UnplannedMovie Dumbo was shown in 4259 locations. #Unplanned got an R rating, and with the lack of advertising factored in...the math is pretty amazing! As a retired principal, I feel that instead of putting a condom on a banana for sex ed, show the film. #prolife"

He doesn't need to hear from 40 year old white polar bears about his animated time, as it wasn't meant for them...

But this doesn't mean he hates white polar bears...

Did he mention... He doesn't hate white polar bears...."

Disney has released a comment that Dumbo is the most powerful, flying elephant in the Disney Cinematic Circus Universe...."

Dumbo wants more diversity at his press conferences.

He's fed up of seeing too many white toxic polar bears...

He wants more giraffes, donkeys, and flamingos...

He's also getting a gofundme set up to send young elephants to see his film."

"323","Non-April 1st-related take: DUMBO is Tim Burton's most tender and most beautiful film in many year (since SWEENEY TODD, imo), as in touch with childhood wonder as it is with the grim recognition that comes around adolescence of worthlessness in a globalized capitalist society"
"324","DUMBO is far from perfect and certainly doesn't capture Burton's majestically grim and anarchically funny vision in the way that, say, BIG FISH does. But like BIG FISH, it is saturated with warmth and love, and driven by enchantment - which makes it a perfect film for Disney."

"738","@GailUpp @HillaryMonahan MAYBE if it came with a placard at beginning &amp; end saying “Dumbo is a metaphor for children abducted from their parents at the border. If you are crying, you should be protesting. Right now. This film is funding RAICES &amp; ACLU. Please help us help them.” 
Since that’s unlikely..."

"744","New seats and a theater to ourselves! #Dumbo"
"745","@bricket I mean, Disney could have produced a Paddington-style sequel to “The Great Mouse Detective” (so many stories from Eve Titus’ books) with a fraction of the Dumbo money. And that would have made money hand-over-fist. Because people actually like Sherlock Holmes."
"746","I saw Dumbo’s failure at the box office from miles away. Who wants to pay big movie bucks to see that much sadness?"
"747","@Chaotic_Mariah Dumbo is just special because of my mom it's not a favorite either, but with all the remakes coming out I gotta remember this is for a whole new audience &amp; it's not gonna be the same so I shouldn't be hard on them. Southern actually, the map shows Florida first in 1921 I think"
"748","@Chaotic_Mariah They do! Only Dumbo isn't drunk and they do it as a part of an act. I think the music is more intense than the pink elephants themselves. Dumbo is mesmerized in the scene It's cute when you look at Dumbo."
"749","I want to see #dumbo already <U+0001F418><U+0001F37F><U+2665><U+FE0F>"

"752","Lowkey really hype to see Dumbo. It better be good"
"753","@ashmor14 Dumbo was never a favorite of mine, so not sure whether the nostalgia will be a problem. But he actually has an accent in this one? English, I’m guessing? Wonderful either way!"
"754","Fun little irony regarding the new Dumbo:

The original Dumbo cost less than $1 million to make in 1941, and wound up being just one of two early Disney films to turn a profit.

The new Dumbo cost $170 million to produce, and it will be fortunate to turn any profit at all."
"755","Was Dumbo supposed to be a seat warmer to get people hyped for the Lion King? Cause it’s kind of failing at that"
"756","Dumbo is a lie.These animals and elephants are abused."
"757","The new dumbo movie is so cute I cried 3 times"
"758","and still the original 1941 Dumbo had much to say about revenues increasing for animated productions and yet those that wanted to see the world of academics through an elephant had much to learn about dumbo and French onion."
"759","Sooo happy they kept the pink elephants in it too! There was such attention to detail to this film. Stayed true to the loving story, yet elevated it to a modern showing that kids would relate to now. Can’t get enough of how amazing + cute it was #Dumbo"

"763","@Belen_BWT Dumbo is so gross. Also Song of the South. Disney did some... things back in the day."

"766","I've learned never compare to the first one . If I wanted to see the original ? I would just watch that one."

"768","Animation and cinematography excellence"
"769","This thread males me feel better about not wanting to get near this movie. Dumbo is AWFUL and sad and I don't need that in my life. I think it might even be more painful now that I'm an adult.

"787","I completely disagree.  Is it Academy Award material - no - but it's done very well, flows nicely,  is easy to watch &amp; will leave you inspired to help the women and children being victimized by this big, for profit company making millions off of lies and manipulations."

"921","I was mesmerized by #dumbo like a child of 10, seeing E.T. or a child of 9 meeting #indianajones for the first time.  #ehrenkruger and #timburton deserve all the kudos for returning us to the imagination and wonder of Hollywood past"
"922","Disney uses book smarts and curiosity as a substitute for female independence in the same way that proficiency in martial arts or a leather jacket once signaled that female characters were “tough” and “cool.”"
"923","I’m pissed that #Dumbo is getting such shitty reviews and now I find out that it’s not gonna be in theaters near me anymore , I don’t know if it’s just around me or its everywhere. @Dumbo"

"941","@LBardugo More importantly, will you now see white walkers as dumbo now, forever changing your view of them. Maybe they just want to fly over that great big ice wall that is life."
"942","@tenoko1 @HillaryMonahan That one I could handle. But not Bambie and definitely NOT Dumbo."
"943","@zainabsikander This dumbo think constituency and District is same."
"944","To emphasize how underwhelming DUMBO is, I'll say this: Even Eva Green couldn't save it."
"945","@bakatino @InspiredFatty It probably doesn’t help that, yes, elephants are cute in cartoons and in real life, but live action Dumbo constantly looks like he’s going to shit himself in fear."
"946","@bakatino @InspiredFatty I really liked Dumbo when I was like four and it never scared me, but it’s definitely one of the darker Disney movies and something cute in a cartoon doesn’t always translate well in live action. I hope enough parents complain this time and Disney stops these unnecessary remakes."
"947","In the 31st cutscene, we have a flashback sequence to when Beast, Dumbo, and Tidus first encounter The Peddler."
"948","Not one of you will ever understand why the animated film Dumbo hurts my heart."

"980","Finally watched The movie US when I should of just watched Dumbo"
"981","Just came out of seeing Dumbo and what a movie. Even if it’s not as memorable as the classic animated 1941 original, it still takes flight thanks to a fun story, beautiful visuals, an amazing cast, a wonderful score by Danny Elfman and great directing by Tim Burton that’s perfect"

"1001","The ones where the biggest stars are Beyoncé &amp; Will Smith and not Danny Devito? Eh, probably not."

"1007","@UnplannedMovie @captainmarvel If I did the calculation correctly, Dumbo averaged $3,568 (per screen total 4,259) on opening night."
"1008","I want to go see Dumbo."
"1009","@washingtonpost Considering that dumbo is one of the oldest Disney's movies, i think they already expected it. In other hands, lion king, Aladdin and mulan were released in 90'. Then, I think they will probably blow away the box office."

How about writing new content/stories instead of regurgitating old ones over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

They could also stand to stop ruining classic franchises."

"1016","Dumbo was a solid film, very visually appealing. Danny Devito was the star of the show, absolutely hilarious."
"1017","One of the most egregious things about the Dumbo remake is that I'm being reminded of Tim Burton's career once again"
"1018","I couldn’t watch Dumbo without Stefani crying.. <U+0001F602>"

"1023","this fucking idiot threw away my high beams and was replacing the low beams??? So now I have no low beams and we can’t get the high beam into the socket and now we’re gonna miss Dumbo bc of it I’m so fucking irritated"
"1024","@washingtonpost No. Dumbo was different because there really isn’t a “lead”. Certainly not Dumbo in this version. There was also no big stars attached. Almost all other remakes have big stars in prominent roles. If those underperform, that’s when Disney should be concerned."
"1025","@AOC hey dumbo, President Trump never said Reducing immigration, only ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,  you friggin moron"
"1026","To say that the live action Dumbo was a disappointment is a major understatement. But we all know the remakes are never as good as the original. #favoritemovie #originalsforlife #NotAmmused #NotAprilFools"

"1036","It’s pretty well guaranteed to top the iTunes etc rental charts for weeks, then every thanksgiving and Christmas thereafter so..."
"1037","I'm taking my Nana to see Dumbo this week cause it was our movie when I was a wee boy and I know this elephant is about to be bullied to oblivion so I can't wait to cry my eyes out in front of her."
"1038","So, #Dumbo was... kinda great? I'm not sure why this movie is getting such bad reviews. It's not a cookie-cutter remake, but more of a different approach to the original material. It's more like Maleficent than Beauty and the Beast. Did I see the same movie the critics did?"
"1039","I appreciate it more when a remake goes its own way using some similar elements, instead of being a shot-for-shot remake. That's why I really like remakes like The Thing, The Fly, and The Blob. Dumbo is like those where it has similar elements, but is essentially a new movie."
"1040","More things I liked:
- Danny Elfman remixes the original's songs + channels his early music style
- The parallels between Dumbo's issues and the family's are well-done
- Dumbo plushies in-movie are the actual ones at Disneyland lol
- Movie is a huge middle finger to Disneyland"
"1041","Things I liked:
- First half is like the original movie, then the second half takes an idea from the old ending and goes wild with it
- Acting is great. Danny DeVito is awesome. Alan Arkin is hilarious.
- Dumbo is adorable
- Moneymen and their theme parks are the real villains"
"1042","Time to see #Dumbo !"
"1043","I find it odd that critics were saying the film had no character arcs for anybody other than Dumbo, and that the film is soulless and a cash grab. I mean, you can say that about any of the Disney remakes, but the Dumbo remake definitely has character development and emotion."
"1044","@peta I want to turn dumbo into elephant <U+0001F969>"

"1063","Dumbo was a cute movie but they made it more about the humans than the elephants. It’s not like the cartoon version that we all loved so dearly"

"1070","When I saw the dumbo trailer I legit started crying.. dumbo has always been one of my fav Disney movies."
"1071","Elephants are the most intuitive, spiritual and empathetic animals.  They deserve our protection and loyalty, not our torture for entertainment."
"1072","@washingtonpost Stop making nursery rymes or child toys into 2 hour long epics. Dumbo, Horton Hears A Who, Grinch, Nut Cracker, Peter Rabbit, Trolls, Emoji, and Lorax where never going to have a compelling underline story. Go ahead, try a Red Rover or Duck, Duck, Goose movie. Hello Kitty?"
"1073","@gregjames @jimmy9 @josbuttler Dumbo Jimmy even couldn't shred a photo properly... Ha ha <U+0001F602>"
"1074","so, it turns out, the Dumbo live action movie has a message re: animal welfare afterall. I suppose, you need to watch it and judge it for yourself before you go all anti on the big bad mouse"
"1075","Pretty sure Tim Burton is in a bad contract where the execs are holding his soul hostage, because Dumbo just didn’t make sense otherwise."
"1076","Love the Italian version of “Baby Mine”—a timeless song.  #Italy #movies #baby #music #bemine"

"1089","@Nitomatta @rodakscreens It works. The movies tend to always do well. Movies like Dumbo are the exception, but even when Disney “loses”, they’re still happy with the film and it’ll eventually make its money back and pump more interest in the IP and ride."
"1090","I hadn't thought much one way or another about the new Dumbo movie not doing well at the box office, until some jerk of a website posted that story under a picture from the movie of Dumbo lying in a cage looking sad."
"1091","@HaleighFoutch I am one who cries very easily. Hell, I cried in Cheaper by the Dozen 2. But I found the emotional scenes in Dumbo lacking. I should have been in tears when he was separated from his mom, but I wasn’t. And I’m not sure why."

"1277","// Off to bed since I got class tomorrow and I might go see Dumbo with my mom so I’ll be back later on tomorrow."
"1278","@NihilistZealot You ain't lying. Every day, it's some new bullshit. Today it was about Dumbo fat shaming people and tomorrow it'll be something else. I'm fat. I'm perfectly cool with Dumbo."
"1279","And honestly, i will never forgive Dumbo for that Jim Crow bullshit."
"1280","I was so excited for the movie Dumbo. Obviously not one of my childhood faves but a good lesson. Sad to hear it’s flopped massively <U+0001F625>"
"1281","I'm going to go and see it because of Reasons (and also Danny DeVito I LOVE YOU) 

But I'm not going to lie, the (basically) Lana Del Ray ""Baby Mine (Don't You Cry)"" in the trailer rocked me to my very core, and I whispered ""how dare you"" in the theatre"
"1282","@Ebeeto Omg God so cute! But not as cute as Dumbo™ the new family feature from Disney™ directed by Tim Burton™! In theaters now!"
"1283","I'm watching dumbo this weekend, alone if no one wants to go with me <U+0001F621>"

"1289","It sounds like this coming day I might be going to see the new Dumbo movie. I would have gone to it sooner, but no one provided me with a magic feather so I could fly to the theater on my own."
"1290","For real, I wish that there was some timeline where Tod Browning could've directed a Dumbo. 

It probably would've been nightmare fuel, BUT it would've starred Lon Chaney and embraced just how bizarre circus life is while still being reverent."
"1291","I *was* traumatized by that but it doesn't mean I'm not going to watch the movie and cry over it again"
"1292","@not__vee @ermac90210 @kolle_hond I think you will find good old Walt actually did those things in the 1930s, doesn't stop Dumbo from being a good movie tho."
"1293","I'm hearing negative comments about it"
"1294","@fuku_art really makes you wonder what they see in and take away from it...reminds me of that quote about the author watching dumbo with the bullies in their class and realising everyone sees themself as the underdog."

"1299","#Dumbo last night, quite enjoyed it. @cineworld would have been better if the bloke in front didn't have 3 pints and get up for a piss every 2 minutes <U+0001F620>"
"1300","@JusZCosplay Thank you for sharing this. While there are sweet moments as a whole Dumbo is a very sad story. And remaking it more about the people than the animals is just furthering how cruel a story it is. I don't want to hear the poor circus people tales who treat animals like props."
"1301","Up nice and early. Of to the cinema to watch Dumbo on my own this afternoon, feed up of people letting me down."
"1302","the original dumbo is the only dumbo we needed"
"1303","Does anyone think #Dumbo being the first of the Live Action Disney re-makes to not receive good reviews make Disney re-think things and go ""Just because we can doesn't mean we should?"" Or do they make too much money off these to care? Why am I asking and answering a question?"
"1304","This #Dumbo doesn’t know about...
Indian constitution 
Parliamentary democracy

"1327","@JusZCosplay Can't imagine. Glad I wasn't a huge Disney fan growing up. Cartoon is tough to watch, especially in light of current events.

That Marvel wave plus US killing it at the BO is another reason why Dumbo's been left out, and don't forget Aladdin and Lion King this summer, so..."

"1826","@collinCJ5 @MatthewBouman1 In the meantime just check out my reviews if you want to see stuff that I write. I got two movies coming this week that I'm going to see and luckily they're going to be probably much better movies than Dumbo and Wonder Park even though I didn't think Dumbo was that bad."
"1827","The way seokjin reminds me to watch dumbo cause I havent watched it yet <U+0001F602> okay ya girl going to watch it tomorrow"
"1828","hi i cried so hard during dumbo that i had to stop myself from sobbing bc i didn’t want to disturb anyone else"

"1832","@lostingreatbook Right? I am still scarred. Couldn’t even watch the goddamn trailers of Dumbo for fear of that scene."
"1833","@Luminosity48 Dumbo looks like it was explicitly made to make adults full-on ugly cry in the middle of a full theater lol"
"1834","just finished watching dumbo and my sensitive soul couldn’t bare to watch the whole thing without crying. elephants are such magical creatures. <U+0001F62D>"

"1839","um i really enjoyed dumbo"
"1840","@KandDfreak @Dumbo Yes it is Pooh from Christoper Robin movie"
"1841","Dumbo really had me crying lol"
"1842","@JMarshallTV I don't think anyone truly believes Disney are 'original'. Their best content is based off something that already exists!
... and their worst are shameless rehashes of old movies. Seriously, who the fuck asked for live action Dumbo?"
"1843","So excited to go with a small mob to see DUMBO at an early matinee tomorrow! We'll be back in plenty of time for THE WATCH."

"1854","Just caught this movie. Had to feed my kid's Tim Burton addiction. She's seen every one of his films in theaters for the past 19 years."
"1855","How many of y’all actually seen Dumbo?"
"1856","Dumbo was heartwarming af but was kinda working in the mindset of ""everybody knows this tale already anyway"" and so lacked the necessary development for the bond between animal and family to be made more precious and unforgettable to live up to the iconic original."
"1857","Tell me guys. What type of trucks were used to make up the circus train that Casey Jr was pulling in Dumbo (2019)?"
"1858","And that KH and KE are definitely the same letters. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk."
"1859","Dumbo was such a good movie it really made me cry 2 times through the movie but I laughed so much such a good movie has to be one of my favorite Disney movies"
"1860","finally went to go see dumbo 10/10"
"1861","OK lastly I 100% cried when Dumbo flew the first time, and also when they played their version of Casey Jr, called Train's A Comin'. I love some good nostalgia."
"1862","I feel like if you're going to do a live action remake of a cartoon it's important to keep some fundamentals. I understand that in the real world a stork cannot deliver a baby elephant, but why couldn't Timothy Mouse and Dumbo be friends? The mouse was hardly a character."
"1863","Real talk about Dumbo for a minute. Possible spoilers kids. First, is Tim Burton even allowed to make a movie without Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter? Slightly shook that neither one was in the movie."
"1864","Dumbo is such a beautiful movie <U+0001F62D>"
"1865","AFTER LE MANDABA NOOO that's basic and disgusting"
"1866","@TyleKurner I think you’re better off rewatching Babe, tbh. Dumbo satisfies neither of these with emotional depth. I may have teared up, but I cried more watching Cruel Intentions last week, so"
"1867","Dumbo taught me you can be thicc and fly"
"1868","Just finished watching @Dumbo with my Mom and Grandma glad I spent time with them always gotta show love to your love ones"
"1869","Not gonna lie Dumbo is the best movie I’ve seen this year. (And it’s also the best live action Disney film!) <U+0001F418>"
"1870","Dumbo is this generations’ well, Dumbo. It’s Disney’s best live action movie to date and I kinda felt like a kid again"
"1871","@TheBlackHoof Jenn! I'm not sure how much time, if any you spend in Brooklyn (Heights, Downtown or DUMBO), but looking for cool places to hang. Good drinking estblshments, outdoor patios,good vibes, food or views.. Any recommendations that aren't $$$$?"

"1873","@OnceTees Dumbo"
"1874","I have yet to see Dumbo.."
"1875","We’re watching #Dumbo tonight.
Please don’t at me with your bad reviews."
"1876","Dumbo was very disappointing to watch in terms of plot and many other aspects. However, I still cried when he and his mom were separated (I always cry over separation and reunions in films) and these little cunts behind me were making fun of me for it."
"1877","Tuesday is movie day @Dumbo<U+0001F418>  #datenight<U+0001F970>"
"1878","My mom after seeing Dumbo: “Maybe you can fly with your Dumbo ears”"
"1879","It's weird that Disney's massive, intricate box-office fraud operation was ONLY deployed to help the movie from the constantly overperforming megafranchise that most looked like it would be fine on it's own instead of, like, A WRINKLE IN TIME or DUMBO..."
"1880","Investigation AND JAIL awaits"
"1881","If you’re planning on seeing Tim Burton’s Dumbo, bring a supply of hankies. Not because I cried like a baby, or anything. Just in case your popcorn is over buttered or whatever."
"1882","Dumbo was an incredible movie. I might have shed a tear or two. <U+0001F418><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F3AA>"
"1883","I wonder if Dumbo gets drunk with that mouse in that new movie"
"1884","Took kids to film, #Dumbo. Big mistake. First half hour all violence. There was animal abuse, frightening situations throughout, poor direction, really bad acting. Way too long bc bad editing, the worst music. Don’t take yer kids. Or yerself."
"1885","@DebruskSzn @MapleLeafs Dumbo? Sorry for being one game off <U+0001F923><U+0001F923>. Tell me, did you have to take your shoes off? Or did your husband help you with that answer"

"1890","@gotMAB21 Actually DUMBO was partially made by scabs cause the animators were on strike. However, Disney felt he needed to cave to his worked because the audience wanted only they could create. Makes sense. I don't see it as the same for most of the jobs in game dev."
"1891","The new Dumbo movie was THE CUTEST I’m still crying"
"1892","@UnknownKadath The Jungle Book remake was more entertaining, Dumbo was just dull and annoying. If they hired some Children that could act then it would have been passable at best. I loved the original a lot, this felt weak in comparison."
"1893","the amount of money this whole fit cost is just- hhh"
"1894","My dads so excited to see dumbo but he didn’t wanna see Captain marvel with us okay John I see where your loyalty lies"
"1895","@melatonin_idk1 I cried one time but I think I was just using the movie as a outlet to my emotions but dumbo is adorable"
"1896","Why did I just Remember dumbo is sad wtf I dont like this but the child sitting next to us is looking back at us so I waved And he waved and I made a friend through my tears life is crazy man"
"1897","Yallllllllllll, if y’all haven’t seen <U+0001F418> Dumbo, I recommend y’all go watch it <U+0001F62D> such a good movie, almost cried."
"1898","I really want to watch Dumbo. I’m ready to cry <U+0001F62D>"
"1899","@Sen_JoeManchin @TheJusticeDept Duh, what is your problem Dumbo? Did you not vote for this whacko A.G. Barr? Uh, did the people of your state (my own sister included) not vote for Asshole Trump? YOU ALL DESERVE WHAT WE ALL GOT!! You STUPID idiots! YOU gave us this headache. You gave us this problem.

"1904","@the_moviebob If I were the house of mouse and trying to push an ""agenda,"" I'd have definitely propped up Wrinkle in Time more.  Dumbo kinda feels like they gave it to Tim Burton to keep him distracted and away from projects that might work."

"1912","It was cute and really good but god dang I couldn’t stop crying when everyone laughed at baby dumbo’s ears and took him from his mommy"
"1913","@davidscottjaffe It really only ever takes a few voices of the privileged to tell people that the people they don’t value are worth something. Disney didn’t lose to unions because of Dumbo. He lost because he needed a Dumbo to know what was always true in the first place."
"1914","@davidscottjaffe Disney didn’t see the value in his animators either until one of his “boys” turned on him to side with them and made their boycott more real. He did work with scabs for Dumbo and he took himself completely away from animation altogether after caving on unions feeling betrayed."
"1915","Loved @DannyDeVito in his role. #Dumbo"
"1916","@THR Disney failed at marketing this movie, no big buzz around it, no big trailers playing with the movie.
But the audience that went to see the movie cared, hence the A- cinemascore.
It could've been way bigger if Disney wouldn't have dropped the ball.

I have no fucking clue how they made a live action film more fictional than the animated one.

"2007","Tim Burton's ""Dumbo"" is one of  his most ordinary, if not worst, efforts.  Other than the flying Dumbo, everything else from story to characters is formuliac, and bland.  It has been 'dumbed' down to a family film, which is probably how they wanted it.  It gets 3 out of 5 Tweets."
"2008","Dumbo. They chose Dumbo. I was getting ready to blame @AMCTheatres for not adding Shazam! to any #DolbyCinema locations, but I think it’s Disney’s fault. <U+0001F623>"

"2011","@JesabelRaay @TheFliteCast That’s a neat view. It seems there’s less risk taking with remaking their classics to live action now with Dumbo and Aladdin.

Most people never knew the original Aladdin story was based in China and the genie is a djinn."
"2012","Went to see Dumbo tonight, and I will say, just watch the animated one.
The movie focuses more on the humans, there is a stereotypical big bad businessman for a villain, Dumbo flies too early in the movie, and the song Baby Mine is played in a scene it doesn't even fit into."
