"91","DC struck gold with #Shazam. @ponysmasher’s direction with this movie is very unique. Not only is it light-hearted, but there are some dark, maybe even horrific undertones in the movie that I didn’t expect. However, one of the best things to me, it has incredible heart. (1/5)"
"92","@TheGramOfCinema @ponysmasher Oh dude, I love what Snyder did, it’s brilliant. I understand the change of pace, if it’s done well like in WW, Aquaman and now with Shazam. It’s just people weren’t ready for the take Snyder did. In my opinion anyways."

"380","@RandiWhite @MatthewACherry @SpiderVerse Black Panther has nice representation but it’s not DIVERSE. Shazam you have a Latino character, an Asian character, a little girl of colour, and many other side characters given lines. 

Infinity War is nearly all white and the ‘diversity’ is CG characters or sidekicks"
"381","I’d rate the movie a 9/10. Excellent cast and acting! #SHAZAM"
"382","//I'm going out with friends I'll answer you all in the morning or afternoon night and I saw Shazam I laughed so hard it was amazing anyways night//"
"383","A gif of Shazam flossing is about all I need to lose any desire to see this movie and I already had none"
"384","Had fun in Shazam and I appreciated its ending moral about the importance of the redistribution of power"
"385","@realbocaj i say “shazam” and i’m lil rel howery"
"386","@gibsoncomics If they can do what they did with the #ShazamMovie then they can do Robin."
"387","@marcbernardin You don't have to put down Shazam by calling out movies you think has more diversity in their cast, even if you may be right. I wouldn't stress too much by what the title of a Yahoo article has to say about Diversity in Hollywood.
Shazam rocked and so did its diversity"
"388","@shield1991 @GraceRandolph Timing. being positioned between Captain Marvel and Endgame was a terrible idea. Most families simply dont go to the movies that often. Shazam would have done gaggbusters in August"
"389","Shazam tonight is definitely a move"
"390","@lathdin I never thought of that but it really puts you in an awkward situation, huh? Shazam is the first movie that’s made me want to go to the cinema in a long time. Wish I could take you, maybe with a popcorn bucket on your head to hide who you are but I can’t. If you want to see it"
"391","Okay, so the #ShazamMovie <U+26A1><U+FE0F> was EPIC! Funny and extremely thrilling! I'd recommend watching this with a crowd that'll react back because everyone in the theater was reacting like bat-shit crazy!!!!!"
"392","The more I think about Shazam, the more I really like it. It's a movie without a cynical bone in it's body, and I can't help but love it for that."
"393","@GamerThumbTV Wasn’t Shazam’s name originally Captain Marvel in his early iterations."
"394","Just saw Shazam! I adored every frame of that. Absolutely wonderful."

"397","To say the movie Shazam is corny is an understatement. Oh my<U+0001F648>"
"398","#ShazamMovie was a solid superhero origin movie, way to go!! @DCComics @ShazamMovie"
"399","Fixing to catch @ShazamMovie"
"400","I just want it to be tomorrow night already so I can go to Olive Garden with Nicky and then go see Shazam <U+0001F630>"
"401","SHAZAM!

There's no better feeling than when the DC films gets the characters I grew up with right!"
"402","#SHAZAM  is fantastic. So fun and heart warming"
"403","I would highly recommend seeing Shazam! 10/10"
"404","Yes, Shazam has some scary stuff in it. Yes, parents should be warned in advance. But also, yes, it’s good for kids to get scared at movies. All the stuff I grew up with had terrifying stuff in it. It’s part of what made me fall in love with movies."
"405","So... DC decided to follow the Marvel model. Just saying. <U+0001F60F>"
"406","@rustyhatchell And that could just become DC's brand, because at this point I really cannot expect a cohesive and coherent DCU to ever form. But maybe DC can become the big tent franchise, where Shazam and The Joker can coexist. Have a novel approach to our characters? Why the hell not?"
"407","@GraceRandolph I thought some projections had Shazam opening around 40 million. I'm surprised it won't do better though, with so much comic hype right now. And it got great reviews."
"408","@DavidAFrench Kidding aside, Shazam was a lot of fun and I hope they make a sequel."
"409","Shazam was pretty decent. That’s two DCU movies in a row that where good."
"410","@MrFreckles10 @GraceRandolph Shazam was very cheesy from the beginning. I understand if the character was like that due to him being a kid but everyone was like that. I felt like I was watching a Nickelodeon movie not a DC movie."
"411","When I was a kid we had videodisks of the Shazam cartoon, loved seeing those goofy-ass characters given new life!"
"412","Shazam and Bumblebee have a similar vibe I dig. It's not really aimed at me but I enjoyed both of those movies."
"413","But I don't want to spoil anything so I'll save my Shazam takes..."
"414","This man speaks wisdom, friends."
"415","My new obsession/forever vibe is the evil villain in #Shazam in his LEATHER DUSTER with a FUR COLLAR <U+0001F44F> <U+0001F44F><U+0001F60D>"

"417","i saw shazam!!! it was good but it doesn’t surpass into the spiderverse in terms of humor. however the action scenes and acting are excellent <U+0001F497><U+0001F497><U+0001F497><U+0001F497><U+0001F497> 7.5/10 would see again"
"418","God I really am a sucker for a found family story #Shazam"
"419","@nowayneophobic @Ruth64933323 @DDayCobra @Itsashortstory @yogibythefly Driving back from a massage and watching my owner's review of Shazam.  I jacked up my back so I'm going to get stoned on PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION and try to unkink my spine.

FYI, don't let a Fiat roll on you, they're heavier than they look."
"420","@michelleborth u did a great job as Mary shazam @JerryOrdway the shazam writer would b proud"
"421","@JerryOrdway @1moreGaryFrank @geoffjohns @HenryGayden It's like the shazam family u all have a important part of the team in creating memorable stories"
"422","@SolidRoar @JerryOrdway @ShazamMovie Was lucky to get the  hardcover of TPoS plus I read the entire series. Wish they had used your origin for Captain Marvel (I know they're close like all Shazam origins) but yours captured little more of the spirit of the characters (IMHO anyway). 

Looking forward to the movie tho"
"423","Going to @ShazamMovie tonight and I’m wearing my pajamas because it’s a 9:45 showing and I will be darned if I’m wearing jeans that late!"
"424","@WildstormsCCG @robertshepard36 @ShazamMovie @JimLee @Sinccolor That is bad ass! Love it"
"425","@The_MOE_Dome @staredcraft @UpToTASK @ChecKtheCircuiT @artbyatlas0 @MTFIII @MrNiceGuy18_58 @In_Cli_Nation @Burn0321 @BThanBTI @3BlackGeeks @ShazamMovie Oh I just wanted to make sure you didn't feel bullied as that was never the intent of this post. Just a question but what do you mean by Classic Villains Dr. S has been around since 1939 and came a while before Black Adam."
"426","@The_MOE_Dome @staredcraft @ShazamMovie I only saw the reply I replied to sorry about that. You stated classic villains in a reply. I was just curious who you meant outside of Black Adam it could have been people I didn't think of for Shazam. The caps make it seem like your offended, no offense intended."
"427","@The_MOE_Dome @staredcraft @ShazamMovie Oddly enough... yea Harley is gonna be with the Birds of Prey movie. A Black Adam solo back when he started would be dope I would love to see it. Kind of like the Scorpion King but really good, show him from a different light."
"428","@The_MOE_Dome @staredcraft @ShazamMovie Honestly I felt that they could have done a solo black adam movie first. Show his fall from grace and go more in depth to someone who is seen as a villain but really wanted the best for his people. Also the rock has been casted for so long I thought it was odd he wasn't in this."
"429","So it’s been confirmed, I’m seeing #Shazam tomorrow <U+0001F929><U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FD>"
"430","I must say two captain marvels really did a great job! #shazam<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"431","I like Shazam! It a pretty good movie. My only complaint is I find Shazam to be a little too goofy.  I hope he mature in the sequel."
"432","#Shazam was amazing fun! Great job @ZacharyLevi and team for making this such an amazing movie going experience.... DC please continue this rhythm"
"433","I dont get why Thundercrack is not winning"

"435","not to be that Person but shazam was such a fun and entertaining movie that i’m surprised it’s a dc movie"
"436","Probably should’ve went and watch shazam..."
"437","Alright, I’m very impressed by #Shazam. Very good super hero movie <U+0001F604>"
"438","Shazam is a heck of a good time! Really enjoyed it! And for all of the talk I’ve seen that’s just fluff and silly, I completely disagree.  It’s full of heart, scares and substance… And everything else awesome."
"439","I might be able to see Shazam tonight"
"440","@Bestorb @rustyhatchell Anyway, Joker is like an Elseworlds. Shazam is officially in the DCEU, with a “cameo” from a major character and references to many others..."
"441","@UpToTASK Terrible timing, imo.  Everyone will be preoccupied with Shazam or Endgame."
"442","@RDMacQ Aha I was telling my friend that. At the movie theater showings of Captain Marvel and Shazam were right next to each other."
"443","@ErinBode Amazing hadhtag answer. I got the Avengers Endgame popcorn tin and cup earlier today when i saw Shazam. The cup had Black Widow on the top of it."
"444","#Shazam was freaking fantastic and I'm really bummed it's tanking everywhere lol. It really should have been held back till August because dropping it smack in between another Captain Marvel (<U+0001F629>) and The biggest movie of the decade was just beyond stupid."
"445","We hope your weekend plans include seeing the adorable @FaitheHerman in the new @ShazamMovie out in theaters now!"
"446","SHAZAM is good. The best part of it is that really captures how children think about superheroes and doesn't take itself very seriously. Shazam is pumped to have powers and mostly just has fun. Overall lighthearted film like Aquaman but less campy."
"447","@GraceRandolph unfortunately Shazam will underperform because it’s not an event film. I know when something is an event film when everyone is talking about it at school. Everyone at school talked about aquaman, captain marvel, iw, and venom but no one is talking about Shazam"
"448","@BobDigi69 People want too much lol you put black Adam in Shazam 1 and the build up to fight is over this is exactly why bvs &amp; justice league are trash... I’d pull a full on soft reboot keeping aquaman and ww erase bvs n JL starting all over new sups n bat let the fans cry lol"
"449","A few things I found utterly refreshing about Shazam.

1) The copious use of night scenes 
2) The lack of a romance plot 
3) The 80s style kid horror/threat level"
"450","@GraceRandolph Shazam has been around a long time but has never been the most popular superhero"
"451","@CDawsonAuthor to make it short and have an idea, take man of steel mix with gremlins and you have  Shazam. I really like it but don't expect a Snyder style movie even if you have all through the movie lots of direct and undirect references to man of steel and BvS"
"452","Oooooh Shazam is getting good reviews i just might have to<U+0001F440>"
"453","Shazam is easily the best DCEU movie so far"
"454","Ds and I went to see Shazam tonight. It was pretty good although the audio description feature wasn't working."
"455","Dissenting? I agree with your review."
"456","#Shazam was a mediocre superhero movie, but it was the PERFECT kids' movie and I plan to watch it every holiday season until I die."
"457","Y’all need to go out and see Shazam this weekend. That is all!"
"458","Shazam was so good, i could see so much of myself in the movie, especially in the character of Freddie, I’ve always been and still am a kid constantly reading about and admiring superheros, the whole movie feels like a love letter to comic fans"
"459","Homecoming     Shazam

"465","Shazam was so much fun! I'm in love with Zach Levi."
"466","@GraceRandolph I’ll be really honest - Shazam wasn’t all that, tbh."
"467","Critical inaccuracy in #Shazam having the cop buy a cheesesteak from Geno's. Everyone knows Dalessandro's has best cheesesteaks in Philadelphia"
"468","#Shazam was SUCH A GREAT MOVIE. Funny but not overly forced followed by some emotion. An absolute step forward. Expectations met and blown past. Already got tickets for the 2nd showing"
"469","@Chenry74 @Blaugrana6988 @BobDigi69 They've said Black Adam will have his own film before he is in one with Shazam"

"471","what if the n-word is this white boys Shazam but he can't say the word cause he's worried about sounding racist.
An old ladies getting mugged but it's by black guys so he just lets her get raped."

"489","Tomorrow morning and on Sunday Morning, @DKUTV plans to stream all 28 episodes of the Filmation live action series, Shazam. The first 15 episodes will be shown on Saturday morning and the other 13 will be stream on Sunday morning. However,, there will be no Facebook Live stream"
"490","Just got out of @ShazamMovie. It’s like #Chuck got super powers instead of the intersect. It was a lot of fun, hilarious, and delightful. Thank you @ZacharyLevi for being the least destructive DC superhero at this point! #buildingsmattertoo"
"491","Took today off, I wanted to try to hold off until Sunday but I needed a mental health day... Went and saw Shazam(with was awesome!) and cleaned the kitchen. Now I'm going to veg on the couch and try not to cry seeing all these Dogbomb posts <U+0001F62A>"
"492","If there’s one word I can use to describe #Shazam!, it’s DELIGHTFUL. Full of smiles and a strong beating heart, with star-making turns from @ZacharyLevi and @Jgrazerofficial, I look forward to revisiting every Christmas. Kudos @ponysmasher <U+0001F601><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"493","During the credits I watched my 10 year old say “Shazam” and glance expectantly at the sky"
"494","I'll go ahead and say #Shazam was average. I never read a DC or Marvel comic in my life, I only base my choice on movie viewing. Average, worth seeing, but average"
"495","Captain Marvel says ""get woke bro"" after going to foil a purse snatching but finding out that women don't need rescuing.... Shazam!

In a movie about super heroes. Is this toxic SJW crap everywhere?"
"496","@AlderaanianR @lothcat Shazam is a REALLY great family film. They stay true to the origin in the comics and make it about a foster home."

"506","That moment when you get really excited to see Jerry in #Shazam. #twd #twdfamily"
"507","Just say the word. #SHAZAM! is NOW PLAYING in theatres."
"508","The acting was fantastic. @AsherAngel has gotten criticism for his acting in the film, but I honestly loved it, he played Billy Batson really well. @ZacharyLevi is a joy to watch as Shazam!, he brings a joy to the character that you just don't see in Superhero movies these days."
"509","I just saw @ShazamMovie and I gotta be honest, if @DCComics keeps putting out amazing films like this, and @MarvelStudios starts to put out more mediocre films like @captainmarvel, then we might see a DC comeback. Here are my thoughts of Shazam! #Shazam #ShazamMovie #Film #Movies"
"510","Despite this being a Superhero film, it's clear that David Sandberg took a lot of creativity while making Shazam!. David Sandberg, being a director of horror films, really manages to create quite a few chilling, and sometimes disturbing scenes throughout the film's run time."
"511","Final Thoughts

Shazam has a genuinely incredible cast, more joy and fun than most Superhero films have these days, a good villain, fantastic characters, amazing directing by David Sandberg, and a story that isn't perfect, but still very enjoyable. I give Shazam! an A."
"512","Saw this tonight and it was a lot of fun. Best DC movie so far (excluding Dark Knight trilogy). Set in Philly, Mark Strong as the villain, didn't take itself too seriously. What's not to like?"
"513","//hello everyone how's it going I'm at the movies and going to see the movie Shazam so I'll dm everyone when I get home ok plus I'll be putting my phone on vibrant and I'm glad I'm going to be watching the movie Shazam also again I'll dm everyone later on ok and time for Shazam<U+0001F499>"
"514","@ZacharyLevi Man the movie is very very exciting, fun overloaded and Zach made it a A Master Piece.
<U+26A1> SHAZAM <U+26A1>"
"515","Seconded."
"516","@devinher @ComicPerch It does, but there's crude humor, the middle finger gesture, violent yet bloodless and real life drama. I can imagine the film set in the 40s, if the DCEU wasn't a factor. Note that the film was in development before the DCEU. #Shazam"
"517","That was a nice Easter egg in #SHAZAM by @ponysmasher using Moran as the last name for the school cop — Lorraine Warren’s maiden name from The Conjuring series"
"518","Peter Safran is in his zone!!! Aquaman and Shazam are my favorite DC movies by far<U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"519","@ShazamMovie Mann now this comments want to make me watch it <U+0001F62B>"
"520","Shazam has to be one of the only DC movies I like. Also @ZacharyLevi is the love of my life"
"521","#Shazam was hilarious, i was laughing he whole time and the family dynamic is fantastic. the best dc movie yet, in my opinion."
"522","Phoenix and I are about to watch the #Shazam movie. I hope it’s good. #DCComics"
"523","I love seeing Zach on the big screen, it’s where he deserves. #Shazam"
"524","I think my favorite part of Shazam was the fact that it took place in Philly. It was real cool getting to see a movie other than Rocky take place back home."
"525","So I saw #Shazam for a second time today (13 more to go) and the people behind me kept fucking talking and idk why it's such a hard concept to understand, all you have to do is NOT talk, it's the ONE THING YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO DO AT THE THEATRE, JUST DON'T FUCKING TALK!!!!"
"526","Morality tales for children, religious mythologies and the classics - even when adapted for kids - have that one violent event in them. Children are well equipped to handle the violence if the story weaves a context of survival, good and evil, family and friendships. #Shazam"

What a precious gift you've given us. Thank you<U+0001F64F>"
"533","I'm hearing from my source that Henry Cavil will get a significant raise for Superman appearance. Henry will also get major royaltie money. WB didn't want to pay Henry the money and royalties for small cameo in Shazam. Thus the reason WB didn't show Henry face under old contract."

"536","Shazam! was a really great movie. Arguably the best non-Batman movie DC has put out. Good humor, heart and a good villain. They may have dropped the ball with the collected universe but DC has been killing the solo films as of late  #ShazamMovie"
"537","Streets are saying Shazam the first good DC movie since Wonder Woman"
"538","@JerryOrdway @JamesGavsie @ShazamMovie Ya keep what works. That makes the rest even better."
"539","#ShazamMovie was done really well. Billy discovering his abilities was original, and the surprise towards the end was great. A great family film but it’s very slow in that first act and other than figuring out his powers he doesn’t have much to do. Overall solid, Shazam JL2 <U+0001F440>"
"540","Shazam! (2019, d. Sandberg). For a film that leaned into its goofiness in the trailers, it has a lot of surprisingly dark moments. The plot took a while to get rolling, but at the end I had a huge grin on my face. #2019movies"
"541","#Shazam was great!
The comedy wasn’t forced one bit like people were saying after the trailer. It lined up perfectly with great humor

The adaptation was more than perfect. They didn’t fuk the story up
Action was on point

The 7 was horrible doe
But everything else was perfect"

"545","Great review Rick! I doubt I'll get around to seeing this one in theaters unfortunately, but I'm glad you were positive on it overall."
"546","@ObscureAaron Me either.  But there are some that didn't really care for it.  Which I get.

And, hey, people already kept calling him Shazam anyway.  Might as well embrace it. 

Plus, DC already had the copyright."
"547","@ObscureAaron I know a lot of people were upset at the renaming of Shazam, but it seems oddly prescient and necessary in light of this sort of thing."
"548","Thank you DC for such a shitty movie like #Shazam!
Even The Lego Movie made me feel more adult than that shASSam of yours. It's not for kids, adults or seniors, and I don't recommend it to anyone, anywhere.
No need to write a review about it. It's NOTHING.
Bye."
"549","Wow very impressed with how Shazam turned out 
The DC universe is on its way back up <U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FD>"
"550","I went to see @ShazamMovie today. It's everything I hoped it would be. It pulls on the heartstrings without dwelling on those moments, it's an awesome family/kids movie, and it's another flavor in the delicious ice cream of superhero/comic book movies that can excite us adults."
"551","This weekend, sit down.. Be humble and just say the magic word y'all #Shazam"
"552","We just came out from watching pet cemetery and now we’re about to watch shazam <U+0001F92A><U+0001F92A>"
"553","We just came out from watching oet cemetery and now we’re about to watch shazam <U+0001F92A><U+0001F92A>"
"554","@tylergranger17 Should I see that or Shazam lol"
"555","""Where I come from, the sea carries our tears away.""
""Not here. Here you feel them.""
Re-watching AQUAMAN to pregame for SHAZAM tomorrow, pretty sure this is moment I fell in love. There's such a great ""fuck you, we MEAN THIS"" energy to the film's approach to its cartoon melodrama"
"556","@TheIanChen @RossButler You were so funny in Shazam@"
"557","Just finished #Shazam and I can say it's one of my favorite Comic/Superhero movies. Listen to the reviews. So much heart and passion in the movie. Amazing job to cast and grew <U+0001F44A><U+0001F44A>"
"558","@TheCartoonLoon I don't think she's wrong though. Shazam wouldn't be Shazam if it were forced into that grimdark Snyderverse mold. Imagine if it had to coexist in the same continuity as the new Joker film.. D:"
"559","I have the biggest crush on Zachary Levi right now, I need to see #Shazam"
"560","Taking my son to see #ShazamMovie tonight."
"561","#Shazam was so good! It made me laugh, cry, gasp and applaud. This film has really great representation and comic book references and I really hope @TheRock gets in on the action in the sequel. Also, the kids steal the show as well as @ZacharyLevi"
"562","Yeah I really really enjoyed Shazam, it's pretty lengthy (132 mins) but doesn't feel too long. An amusing and fun twist on superheroes (again). It's a clever idea and they pulled it off with just the right tone. And there's some really terrifying, super dark scenes in it damn."
"563","Being taken to see Shazam tonight. Should I dress cute or be that bitch and wear my Captain Marvel/Carol shirt?"
"564","It’s so hard to tell what some people’s gender is now days"
"565","So, I watched #Shazam again. Still a good movie BTW I really do recommend it, but I went this time to see the #GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters footage... Only to find out that none of my closest IMAX theaters had it.

Kinda sad, got really hyped for it and now I have to rely on YouTube"
"566","We went and saw the movie #Shazam tonight, with @ZacharyLevi. It was a fun entertaining movie."
"567","@ShazamMovie Truly enjoyed this movie."
"568","Shazam is a Christmas movie. End of discussion."
"569","#Shazam works for many of the same reasons #IntotheSpiderverse did. Turns out the message of 'anyone worthy can weild the power' is super resonant in 2019"
"570","#Shazam works for many of the same reasons #IntotheSpiderverse did. Turns out the message of 'anyone worthy can wield the power' is super resonant in 2019"
"571","#Shazam is a perfect 80s throwback without being an obvious pastiche — and there's a wonderful 'Big' reference in the middle."
"572","#Shazam works for many of the same reasons #IntotheSpiderverse did. Turns out the message of 'anyone worthy can weird the power' is super resonant in 2019"
"573","@CoyJandreau @ShazamMovie I finally realized tonight what it means to truly see yourself on the screen. I've heard that phrase before but never experienced it. I always find characters to relate to in movies of course, but I didn't expect to see my story and my kids' stories in a superhero movie! #Shazam"
"574","About to see #Shazam for the 2nd time and #CaptainMarvel at the grand opening of the @StarliteWichita 

@drvanderg 

#DCU &amp; #MCU #Coexisting"
"575","And we need to pay someone just to sit at the table and Shazam every single song so I can have a better playlist but don't give it to me like immediately otherwise it's just going to be like a rerun last night"
"576","Shazam! is really all over the map tonally, but since the first person we see on screen is John Glover... 3 Stars."
"577","Opening day #boxoffice estimate for #Shazam in China is a big $16.4M on a holiday FRI."
"578","Shazam! has grossed an estimated $15.7M internationally through Thursday.

#Shazam  #BoxOffice  @wbpictures  @ShazamMovie"
"579","Solid $5.9M THU pre-shows for #Shazam coming in a bit below $6.4M of #AntMan which was a summer release when schools were closed. $9.2M total when adding in previews from 2 wks ago. All set for #1 opening at #boxoffice this wknd for #DCEU."
"580","#Shazam’s message about focusing on people that care about you and not chasing after those who don’t really hit home, as someone who’s been struggling with that lately. Love seeing @ponysmasher go from no budget shorts to this. Felt like Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man. @ZacharyLevi"
"581","||: SHAZAM PEOPLE!!!

     Like the tweet to be added, maybe RT to spread the word and maybe we’ll get more muses!"
"582","Shazam might be in my top 5 comic book movies"
"583","@KTHdatabase @Shazam @BTSonShazam @BTS_twt Hello @Shazam @BTSonShazam
Would you please change the video linked to @BTS_twt’s Singularity to the official MV? the one you currently have is a lyric video (non official) 

This is the official MV link tht should be linked When Singularity is shazamed"
"584","Whoa. 

#Shazam 

Whoa... 

Who ever made this movie... put him in charge of the rest of the DCU. 

PLEASE. 

Whoa.... that was incredible. 

SO MANY SURPRISES. THE MARKETING WAS PERFECT FOR THIS. 

Whoa........"
"585","@MaxxChewning I need the @MaxxChewning Shazam review too"
"586","Just saw @ShazamMovie AND LOVED it! Many laugh out loud moments, great action and heartfelt moments too. Best villain @MarkStong  and love our new superhero @ZacharyLevi!"
"587","@ZacharyLevi being his charismatic, comedic, joyful self while running around in a skintight red suit and a white cape in @ShazamMovie is utter perfection and comedy gold! It's like this superhero was made for him to bring it to life."

"590","#Shazam Is AMAZING!! Better fasten that tiara MCU, the DCEU  is poised to snatch it from your head!"
"591","Lolol @ZacharyLevi literally said my last name in #Shazam. Pronounced it as “Moron” too. <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"592","who is down to go see shazam tomorrow??"
"593","Shazam was pretty entertaining. something I wanted to happen happen in it xd so I was happy. I don't know much about Shazam though. #Shazam"
"594","*No Spoilers* In Shazam, they had a pretty funny dip at android"
"595","@DavidAFrench @benshapiro @Jamie_Weinstein @guypbenson You’re supposed to be watching Shazam!"
"596","@SinemiaSupport I am not able to book tickets for Shazam. Extremely disappointed"
"597","Saw @ShazamMovie and it’s so much fun! I still wanna see Tawky Tawny though and I hope @ZacharyLevi keeps playing Benjamin Ettengerg but looking forward to seeing him donning the Shazam suit a lot more!!!"
"598","Sinemia’s advance ticketing isn’t working. Thank you, physical card.

Also, not working on Shazam’s opening day? I wonder why? /s"
"599","@SuperSuitShow @staredcraft @ShazamMovie I'm weary of Movie/TV versions of ""Heroes"" vrs the Comics. The Marvel family has many Villains yes. I've been wearing Black Adam gear since 2006. I like the Villains &amp; Anti-Heroes. I'd be MORE into ""Shazam"" if Adam was the Main. I was never a Batson boy. Guy Gardner is my GL- lol"
"600","my dad’s arriving today so hopefully we watch shazam <U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FB>"
"601","@ZacharyLevi I've watched it already and I'll definitely watch it again tomorrow with my brother. Love it! You're the best! #Shazam"
"602","I was sooo excited to see  @ShazamMovie and it did not disappoint meeeeee <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"603","@ZacharyLevi Just saw Shazam and it was fantastic!  Couldn’t have loved it more.  Family friendly, action packed, makes you have all the feels movie.  Highly recommend <U+0001F970>"
"604","#Shazam was absolutely marvelous. Incredibly heartwarming with great comedy and action. Loved it."
"605","Wtfffffffff Shazam was soooo good totally didn't expect it"
"606","Wow.

Shazam was awesome!!!!!!

Perfect movie.

I am smiling ear to ear!!!!!!!"
"607","Alright so I liked Man of Steel and REALLY liked Wonder Woman. But @ShazamMovie is my new favorite in the DC universe. There I said it."
"608","Who’s trying to go see Shazam with me? Lol<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"609","oh good, now a group of teenagers came in loudly complaining that the screening room is full of children. lol this is going to be an experience <U+0001F605> #Shazam"
"610","i always joke that i come to the movie theater at kiddie hour, but (*looks around at the hordes of kids roughhousing in this screening room*) ugh this time i really mean it <U+0001F62B> #Shazam"
"611","@The_MOE_Dome @SuperSuitShow @ShazamMovie You really think they’d just do a move with black adam and forgo Shazam?"
"612","@NintenZ In my opinion, I'd say the rolls are reversed, I think Shazam was much better paced then Captain Marvel, sure the soundtrack was meh, but Captain Marvel just was a bit dry and I had little to no expectation before hand either"
"613","Saw Shazam and it was actually really good, I enjoy less interconnected universe with DC more than their shared one and this is very loosely connected"
"614","I can't wait to see #Shazam tomorrow morning and also getting my pre order tickets for #AvengersEndgame"
"615","So #Shazam is really a heart filled feel good move for the #Wholefamily #friends."
"616","The theatre where I'm watching Shazam just lost power when Billy said Shazam, I'm not even kidding."
"617","I can confirm Shazam is nothing like Deadpool because Shazam is actually funny"
"618","DC is still suffering from the almost killing blow that is called JL
DC's biggest brand almost caused DCEU's destruction
But Aquaman hit $1.1 billion and embraced by fans around the world, and Shazam is doing the same

''Why do we fall?''
''So we can learn to pick ourselves up''"
"619","Shazam!: super fun and sweet. Like a superhero version of Big without the illegal relationship."
"620","@BravesSwearJar @ShazamMovie Waiting to see it!"
"621","@BravesSwearJar @ShazamMovie I love that you love superheroes too"
"622","5. I've been dealing with a really big copyright issue for my music @uncertainmusic which resulted in me not being able to focus on anything else today (Shazam definitely helped as a distraction) so I might be reading up on some legal action I may need to take instead... 3/4"
"623","I'm going to see this tomorrow, excited!!!!! #Shazam"
"624","The movie Shaquille O'Neal was in was called Kazaam not Shazam."
"625","@EricDJuly @YouTube Your review seems more like a 'why Shazam adapted the comic arcs better than captain marvel' rather than ""why Shazam is a good cinematic piece of film making you should watch' comparisons is fair but your style is not really helpful for whether to watch the movie or not"
"626","@NeilShelat6 @ShazamMovie I saw a pre-screening 2 weeks ago. You're in for a treat."
"627","That may have been my favorite DC movie so far! #Shazam! was a TON of fun!"
"628","@IMDb why y’all don’t have @MeaganGood on the website as part of the cast for Shazam ?"
"629","So what do we think of Shazam?"
"630","SHAZAM! HOT TAKE: Everything that takes place before Billy Batson joins his new family is a slog. Everything. In fact, the film doesn't kick into full gear until Zachary Levi appears for the first time!"
"631","I'm actually going to see #Shazam tomorrow and I can't wait to watch it in theatres with some coca cola some candy and popcorn :D"
"632","Wow Shazam was actually a great movie, freaking hilarious too  Ngl, I really loved it!"
"633","@GraceRandolph That’s still a good opening for a movie with the budget #Shazam had. Besides, it could have great legs."
"634","Was @ShazamMovie funny, heartwarming, and wicked cool?  Yes, yes, and lemmethinkaboutit HELL YES! @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher and the whole Shazam! crew knocked it out of the park 9/10, two sparkly thumbs way up!"
"635","Yes! Walkin' in to see @ZacharyLevi play Captain Marvel in #SHAZAM   So. Excited."
"636","10 out of 10 for Shazam! My new favorite DC movie! Plus Grace Fulton is a babe <U+0001F60D>"
"637","Did #Shazam just confirm #StrangerThings is a part of the DC universe??"
"638","Apparently you want a caricature not an actor"
"639","@ZacharyLevi is it too soon to start talking about a @ShazamMovie sequel? This is a great movie! The cast are all fantastic! #Shazam #sequel"
"640","@TheEllenShow @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi U are so awesome!!!"
"641","Just watched Shazam with the homies, definitely my #1 favorite DC movie. Not many options to pick from anyways but it was still a fantastic movie."
"642","Shazam and season 2 of The Tick on the same day.  What a good day."
"643","Shazam was 8/10 . Dc did their not so serious but serious hero movie better then marvel did with Deadpool"
"644","That guy in Shazam who played the wizard...I didn't think I would be able to take him seriously because he's Mr Brown in all the Madea shows and movies. But he was a seriously good wizard."
"645","The scene in shazam where Billy jumps off the roof and turns into Shazam in mid air is top five hero intros this year in any platform including dc, marvel or any anime you can think of"
"646","@ApolloTheLeader Bro she was actually a good heroine and played her role well in shazam"
"647","Let it sit for a day and damn I REALLY loved SHAZAM! Can't fully say why without spoilers thou so I'll give it a few days. But it's both a great fun film and has a really great message about searching and belonging."
"648","I seriously can’t wait to see #Shazam tomorrow!"
"649","when the mall you work at is in #SHAZAM MAN WHAT A GREAT MOVIE"
"650","Just saw “Shazam!” and it was great! I’m glad DC finally realized they don’t have to be super dark, this movie was really well done and super fun to watch"
"651","Came out twenty years before him but okay."
"652","@ArticleGroup @darth Shazam for weird car sounds to diagnose what’s wrong with your car &amp; let you know how serious it is."
"653","@thickandtide @weirdneighbor1 Shazam ended up being a fun movie"
"654","@ShazamMovie Was a great movie. Awesome seeing DC take a light humor approach to super hero movies :)"
"655","Out of #SHAZAM... I could see this becoming a new generation's Goonies... Darla Dudley is the true MVP of this movie...

Also, I did not expect @DylanToomey's favorite meme to show up...
#FizzVsComics"
"656","DC does Shazam justice.  DC is killing it with these individual movies Aquaman, Wonder woman and now Shazam!"
"657","I just saw Shazam.
It's action packed thrill ride with heartfelt humor.
Yes it's very much a lighthearted movie, but the comedy elements are nothing like MCU's cheap laughs.
Because David Sandberg didn't compromise dramatic moments for the sake of cheap jokes.
Another win for DC!"
"658","I want to go and watch Shazam later but then ehhh malas babi."
"659","Wait so I’m seated for Shazam and the theater is showing like the history of green screen. And they showed Cavil vs Ezra in JL. And I saw that it was Flashback FM’s YouTube video <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> it had a watermark and everything"
"660","I just saw this movie and wowowowowowowow super entertaining. Go watch!"
"661","That awkward moment when you realize Stanley Tucci isn’t in @ShazamMovie and it’s Mark Strong"
"662","@CoyJandreau @ZacharyLevi If Shazam is a big success, what do you think the chances are of DC bring ISIS to the big screen?"
"663","Dc did they thing with Shazam"
"664","About to see #SHAZAM I’ll post my thoughts later!"
"665","I didn’t know what to expect with Shazam but I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THAT <U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525>"
"666","What a bummer. ""Godspeed The Shazam"" is an amazing back-to-front record, and the drums are impressively wild."
"667","#Shazam <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> probably the most complete DECU film yet.

"669","Loved it! Watched it every Saturday!"
"670","I have 8 friends of different backgrounds and all of them said SHAZAM was one of the best superhero films they have ever seen. Totally fun. I have to go with those reviews."
"671","I don’t think I’ve ever been to a movie where the whole theatre erupted into applause at the climax. Everyone go see @ZacharyLevi in #Shazam ... you will NOT be disappointed"
"672","I don’t know whether ppl who haven’t heard of #Shazam before the movie came out are uncultured, or if ppl who HAVE heard of it before are just really cultured."
"673","A bit pissed. Was supposed to see a movie with dad tonight (shazam). He ran into traffic weather and construction so we aren't making it. He said he gave himself an extra hour.  That is not what pisses me off though. What pissrs me off is that all he was doing was sitting (1/3)"
"674","@DisneyDan DC's last three critically successful films were all comedic in tone (Lego Batman, Teen Titans Go, and Shazam). Maybe DC can finally take a hint and stop being so serious... (Dark Knight reference intended)"
"675","like at least comparing Shazam to homecoming makes sense but like shazam and Deadpool? seriously? have you seen either film?"
"676","there are people genuinely comparing Deadpool and Shazam and saying Shazam ripped off Deadpool.

What?"
"677","if u think the shazam movie is lame um... ur valid but im sorry that u hate love"
"678","Which Shazam character should I make? I'm torn between two characters"
"679","Before you waste your time on Shazam, Pet Sematary, and Endgame, remember the real filmés out there: Unplanned and Breakthrough, starring Eric Foreman. If you're not supporting Christian cinema, you might be going to a little place I like to called the h-word. Nice knowing ya."
"680","Trying to see #Shazam this weekend!"
"681","#batmanvsuperman is getting new found respect from those who initially hated the movie. @ZackSnyder has confirmed that his version of Justice League is a real thing. #Shazam just hit theatres. @wbpictures, there has never been a better time to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"682","grumble grumble... My Twitter ads are saying other critics are rating #Shazam really highly. I intentionally don't give numbered scores, but it wasn't exactly a ""rave review."" I don't know if it would be a high 5 or a low 6. Which, IIRC, is the boundary between rotten and fresh."
"683","Now I want to watch it cause I laughed maybe once thru both of those movies"
"684","@ShazamMovie I loved the movie!! But I was so disapointed Cavill was not there! This wouldve been the perfect segway to transition him into this unverse!  He is Superman and would fit nicely into this movie!"
"685","I’m guessing you haven’t actually watched #Shazam."
"686","Haven’t seen any #Shazam slander from anyone who has actually seen the movie."
"687","My best friend and I are going to see #SHAZAM at 10!"
"688","@ShazamMovie was everything I'd hoped for! Once it got going, it really worked its wonders and magic. It's a great movie, for sure, It's my fave movie made by @The_DCEU so far! #wonderful #cool #fun #superhero #HighRepeatViewingValue #Funny!"
"689","@GodzillaMovie  @AMCTheatres @IMAX @AMCHelps

"697","I concur with that statement! Very accurate!!"

"715","@mushroomgirl516 OOOOH, a Sky High reference!  I do want to see Shazam!"
"716","Hilarious, great movie! #SHAZAM"
"717","#Shazam reminded me of an 80’s/early 90’s movie. Like Big meets Home Alone. That’s a compliment lol I feel like so many of these comic movies try to make it about the big moments and this was about the little ones."
"718","Shazam was everything I wanted it to be. It was the Billy Batson it needed to be and they kept elements that were positive from that last really shitty run in the comics. That run almost broke the Captain Marvel character or Billy at least. Im glad they went back to the original."
"719","@noobde Mr Boon I give you shit eternally. And I love you. I saw Shazam and as someone that loves Captain Marvel. It was really awesome to see MK in the movie. I like that the Captain Marvel design was also the one from Injustice also. Everything was really well done. Awesome."
"720","@ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Great F-ing Movie. Hope everybody can enjoy this movie as much as I did!!"
"721","@ThePoetApostate You’re watching a movie as good as Shazam and still thinking about Captain Marvel?

Someone’s living rent-free in your head man."

"729","seeing shazam! right now prepare for another segment of nick's movie corner in a couple hours"
"730","#Shazam was so good. I think it’s my new favourite DC movie (which is not a very high standard but whatever). I’m just so happy that we live in a time where we can have good Marvel and DC movies at the same time."
"731","I thought Shazam would be some light hearted fun but my god do they go to some dark places. Didn’t do a good job of balancing the tone at all. Still had an ok time but wow, kind of a mess all around"
"732","@marionette19990 I went to see shazam and it was awesome"
"733","there is also a joke in the movie SHAZAM about the main kid stealing a lunch bag from Geno’s from a Philly cop, which is funny on two levels because only racists go to Geno’s"
"734","just saw Shazam and am concerned by Philly having to play the “recognizable American city getting destroyed” role that’s usually reserved for San Francisco"
"735","So much comic book work on a day where NXT Takeover is occurring, Sabrina’s new season is premiering, and Shazam is out in theaters! And we’re only in the beginning of the month!<U+0001F631>"
"736","Internationally ...

#Shazam Has Grossed An Estimated $15.7 Million Through Thursday .. (Without China) ..

Excellent Start ..<U+0001F44D>"
"737","I personally enjoyed Captain Marvel better than Shazam, it felt better paced and more fleshed out knowing what it wanted to be, while Shazam felt a bit all over the place with it’s tone and references.

Also Captain Marvel has a better soundtrack."
"738","I saw Shazam, it was okay.

The first act wasn’t very good but the second act was much better... even if it had problems...

All-in-all a decent film, not amazing in my eyes, but still good."
"739","@NickDaDroid But Captain Marvel was made for everyone.

Shazam also felt really strangely depressing at points so I dunno."
"740","@MaracleMan Well i don't think Zachary Levi was a good pick to play Shazam. If they are going to have Shazam in j.l. 2(which SPOILER ALERT) he should be recast."
"741","Watching #ThorTheDarkWorld as a part of my family's MCU re-watch. Gabi and I can't help but scream #Shazam every time @ZacharyLevi is on screen. <U+0001F923>...to the younger sister's annoyance. lol"
"742","Well it wasn't terrible....
It wasn't good. The fight scenes mostly were good. The music didn't make any sense and the original music was overwhelmed by everything else I didn't get to hear it much. 
I think it's going to be forgotten with the #Shazam release"
"743","Barely anybody is here. Outside of me and m friend, only 3 people are here.

Their loss. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

"752","Went to see SHAZAM thinking it was a movie about magic. Stupid me didn't read the synopsis. Boy was I wrong - another superhero movie that is 90% special effects and fights. @RottenTomatoes very highly rated? #notforme <U+0001F621><U+0001F629>"
"753","#Shazam was funny asf I definitely recommend this movie"

"757","#ShazamMovie was very fun. I was well entertained. Best part was when Shazam got hulk’d"
"758","I know I said I’d review Shazam but I’ve decided I need to take a small break from writing reviews. Feeling exhausted and need to focus on other things. I’ll be back at it in a few weeks for Avengers: Endgame. 

For now I’ll leave you with a few quick thoughts on Shazam..."
"759","this part of the book really breaks my heart. it was brilliant. #PowerofShazam"
"760","Shazam! is DC's best movie in their cinematic universe. SO GOOD. HOLY MOLEY.

#SHAZAM"
"761","Trynna see Pet Sematary and Shazam this weekend"
"762","Shazam was good. I always leave a good movie feeling worse than when I went in. Seeing real power and real family/friendship just makes reality that much more shitty. I couldn't have superpowers... that much is for sure."
"763","@DreadyBoyBamBam Shazam has always been one of DCs most Marvel characters (lol he's Captain Marvel). He's loveable and fun and they did right by him for the movie."

"768","@nanakusinho @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @jackdgrazer Same--I had high hopes after the trailers, but didn't expect to get so emotionally invested in the characters. Loved it unreservedly.

"772","Went to see #ShazamMovie this afternoon. After seeing the soulless remake of #Dumbo last week, Shazam was a refreshing delight. Great characters and real heart. Take your family."
"773","Really?"
"774","if anyone has a link to shazam please dm it to me <U+0001F97A><U+0001F97A> i’m desperate,,,, pl ease"
"775","#Shazam is definitely the better #CaptainMarvel movie.

Fun plot and action, characters that were both decently developed and that I could care about, and it balances both the serious and funny moments really well. Good stuff."
"776","Nothing shows more confidence in your promotion than piggy backing off of a different movie’s promotion. I love the cast and the idea to bring a new generation to Chucky, but hate that the creator’s blessing wasn’t given."
"777","I’m verified on Facebook, Spotify, Shazam, Google, and now Apple Music, too, and I have a résumé of film/TV work. It would be a dream come true to add @HawaiiFive0CBS to it. #H50 #H50Friday @PLenkov"

"782","Just saw @ShazamMovie and I HIGHLY recommend it"
"783","However, and I mean it, Shazam is not an all-ages movie. Smart tweens maybe. Teens, sure. Little kids, only if they watch a ton of scary stuff already."
"784","Hi @ponysmasher , thank you for the excellent Shazam! Along with the rest of the film, the opening car ride was superbly done, showing how Sivana started going down the wrong path."
"785","@DestinationKat Shazam it was great"
"786","tweeting from the t-shirt account to tell you all that shazam is wholesome and communitarian and you should watch it"
"787","The Thomas family saw the movie and absolutely loved it!!!"
"788","“i heard shazam wasn’t the best movie”

“well what do you expect when you adapt an app into a film?”

“well it’s such a good app so i thought it’d make a good comic book story”

“true, and it is a cool super power to know what all the songs are”

“well i’m sure they’ll reboot it”"
"789","Seeing my all time favorite superhero in a live action movie was really awesome! @ZacharyLevi thank you for bringing the character to life, Great movie really recommend it (: #shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

"791","@ElizBoyle I wanted to grab every kid I saw headed to Dumbo today and redirect them to Shazam or Captain Marvel."
"792","#Shazam is a fun light movie sure. But it has some extremely adult themes in it. The whole plot with Billy's mother was surprisingly mature and grown up stuff for such a lighthearted movie."
"793","my dceu ranking before shazam:

1: bvs ultimate edition (10/10)
2: man of steel (8.5/10)
3: wonder woman (8.0/10)
4: aquaman (8.0/10)
5: suicide squad (7.5/10)
6: can't give a review since justice league isn't released yet<U+0001F60E>"
"794","To those slamming the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut crusaders like me who WILL see #Shazam...

Let's make a deal we should've made pre-#Aquaman:

We won't say your desired boycotts just guarantee a reboot to a REAL MCU 2.0...

And you won't say we're sabotaging our chance to get the SC."
"795","Have to admit, after Batman v. Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League, I kinda thought DC was going to suck forever. But they've really turned it around with Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam. Loving it."
"796","Shazam turned out to be really goood."
"797","@ZacharyLevi Just finished watching- thank you for being a part of a truly fun, enjoyable movie.  The whole theatre was laughing throughout. So much fun, everyone go see it! #ShazamMovie #CaptainSparkleFingers #funny"
"798","If you look really hard you’ll see my reflection taking this cute ass photo... <U+0001F440> #Shazam"
"799","Shazam was good but several people being on their phones through the whole movie can really ruin your experience otherwise, so don't be that person <U+0001F44D>"
"800","Is that a deductible professional expense?"
"801","Seeing Shazam soon, this will be something"

"805","I saw Shazam in the mall Shazam takes place in this is so cool"
"806","@HimeshMankad Why is Shazam not releasing in 3D in India? Is this going to be a norm for all future Warner Bros/ DC films?"
"807","I find it funny that DC and Marvel both have captain marvel movies out at the same time, and yes the hero name was originally captain marvel, shazam is a silly name  #Shazam #CaptainMarvel"
"808","@NeilShelat6 @ShazamMovie Which one is you again? I know for sure the one on the left is not you!! It’s either the middle one or he one with glasses"

"810","i got 3 days off in a row, im seeing shazam on monday, swc starts on friday, next week is gonna be amazing!"
"811","Shazam was awesome. I'm a few episodes behind on Doom Patrol, so now I'm catching up. Might go see Captain Marvel tomorrow, and I've got tickets for Endgame.

It's a good time to be a fan of comics."
"812","I had completely forgotten that DJ would be Shazam lmao"
"813","Just saw Shazam! in IMAX. It was a great movie! I she surprised that the characters were foster children! I'm definitely doing a video on my thoughts about how the foster care system is portrayed in the movie!

"815","@stesan2015 @MatthewACherry @SpiderVerse The Shazam family alone is more diverse than the spider-verse’s team? One afro Latino boy and an Asian girl, oh, and a pig (white man). These kids have more lines and actual screen time too."
"816","the shazam ad starting with ""the best super hero movie since last month"" might be my favorite opening line for an ad ever"
"817","A Shazam and Plastic Man crossover? Sign me up!"
"818","Who remembers the DC Nation short?"
"819","And yes a bigger nerd than me pointed out that Luthor is misspelled. Auto correct changed it on me and I didn’t notice"
"820","@IndyPopCon have the winners of the Shazam tickets been contacted? o.o"
"821","So I’ve been informed that it is not Stanley Tucci in Shazam or Kingsmen, but someone named “Mark Strong.” I believe that they have merely cloned Mr. Tucci."

"825","Shazam really might be my new fave superhero movie"
"826","Shazam was dope <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FE> happy to see the DC cinematic universe continuing its positive progressive evolution"
"827","Shazam was really dope. They did their thing. 

I would love to see a rated R version but it was dope."
"828","I see that Mark Strong is in Shazam. 
With this knowledge, it puts this movie firmly on my watch list. (Well, I’ll watch it when it hits tv.)"
"829","Shazan is really coooooooooooool."
"830","Watched @ShazamMovie again.....laughed even more &amp; enjoyed it very much....that cameo at the end ( mind blown! ) ... @DCComics"
"831","Trying to outline my #Shazam review but it's mostly keysmashes and all caps at the moment..."
"832","Like intellectual diversity?"
"833","#Shazam was so much fun and definitely DC’s 2nd best production by a LONG shot (sorry aquaman) I’ve been waiting for Zachary Levi to play a superhero since his Chuck days and this was a great payoff"
"834","Nope no only that, I also want to watch Shazam. Plz."
"835","I actually really really really enjoyed Shazam last night"
"836","Just saw #Shazam. Thought it was great! It felt fresh and fun without being ridiculous. @ZacharyLevi was great. Can’t wait to see another one! Until then, I’m gonna be shouting Shazam! quite a bit! @ShazamMovie FYI two end credit scenes too"
"837","Just now sitting down to watch that Gomer Pyle biopic #Shazam"
"838","Shazam was fun. I don't wish any harm to anyone involved in the making of it."
"839","Shazam was honestly really good like whoa DC is stepping up like it was a GREAT movie"
"840","#Shazam is fantastic. Overloaded with charm, heart, and humor. As lighthearted as it is, though, it packs  an unexpected emotional punch."
"841","None of my irls want to go see Shazam with me I’m sad"
"842","Ok, #Shazam was by far the best DC movie yet, and the ending caught me totally off guard. I really enjoyed the poke at the Power Rangers there at the end too..."
"843","I watched #Shazam and I am not disappointed at all. Glade that I watched it instead of #CaptainMarvel maybe another time."
"844","So, we’re gonna see SHAZAM in Idaho. Will it be different from the liberal cut?"
"845","@ZacharyLevi 3rd time seeing @ShazamMovie tonight, 2nd time in @IMAX. I just had to see it opening weekend to support Zac and the rest of the cast. Go check it out! It’s such a fun, family movie! #SHAZAM @ponysmasher @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial"
"846","Shazam takes the lead as my favorite film of 2019"
"847","Okay, Shazam! is the dorkiest movie I've ever seen in my life - like, Masters of the Universe ""In Today's Episode""-level dorky, and I loved it. ^_^ The tone was a little uneven at first, but then they leaned into the dorkiness HARD, &amp; it all came together."
"848","Watched Shazam.

It was a fun movie, but it was about what I expected."
"849","@DCComics @ShazamMovie The strongest hero is the flash"
"850","Wasn’t quite sure what to expect going into #Shazam! But not since Spider-Man 2 have I felt such a pure, unadulterated sense of LOVE, FAMILY, and HEART. This movie is everything that SUPEHERO means. And I’m willing to say it’s one of the best SUPERHERO movies ever made. (1/5)"
"851","THIS is the MOVIE that I want to support. And I’m hoping that you’ll give #Shazam! a shot and support it as well! There are like 50 superhero movies due out in the next few years, and if I could get 50 superhero movies like Shazam!? I could die a very happy man (3/5)."
"852","GOD BLESS @ponysmasher for his incredible interpretation of DC COMICS, #SHAZAM!, and SUPERHEROES. I have never believed in heroes from a superhero movie like I have tonight. This man has come a long way in the last few years. He’s a true visionary (4/5)."

"857","After watching Shazam, a teenager behind me exhales: “That was so loooooong.” It has a runtime of two hours and two minutes. 

This is why we can’t have nice things."
"858","@ZacharyLevi very much enjoyed the movie!!! #Shazam !!!"
"859","#Shazam is fun through it’s brief quality moments within the foster family, but it chokes under the dragging runtime surrounding the disposable villain. Too much forced drama, slow-motion, and fighting. I wanted it to end 45 minutes early, but all I could do was sit there waiting"
"860","Did Thanos snap Black Panthers movie too?"
"861","@DailyNightwing I've seen all the episodes of Doom Patrol, it is so awesome!! Totally want to see Shazam, Captain Marvel and Endgame!!! These hero shows/movies have been so great!!"

Feel like watching marvel movie but use dc heroes"
"872","I decided to see Shazam tonight to start my weekend. Imagine my absolute shock when Legend by @twentyonepilots starts playing in the movie. When I say my jaw almost came unhinged..."
"873","@CrisMovieCorner @jamiehughes17 I just finished it and omg was it cool I'm not spoiling it but Shazam"
"874","I just watched shazam my favorite was hearing the word Shazam it was a great movie 8 out of 10"
"875","@ShazamMovie is honestly amazing! True savior of people and DC"
"876","SPOILER Not sure what made it more well-suited to @Zacharylevi -
A. Shazam finding victory through empowering his foster sibs (just as one of Zac's greatest achievements IRL has been empowering his fans and affirming their worth), or
B. The fact that Billy Batson wears #Chucks."
"877","Seeing a lot of SHAZAM was great and so much better than CAPTAIN MARVEL. Other than the connection in name only, why are we trying to compare them? This feels like passive agressive Marvel vs DC fanboying, and possibly insecure men trying to squash female empowerment. Stop it."
"878","I had two thoughts watching Shazam...

1. Thought it was bold to make the main character Sans. 

2. What if the dudes name was the n word so he’d have to say it to transform. What a shame that would be."
"879","Just saw @ShazamMovie and it was hilarious! Looks like @TheDCUniverse is finally getting their groove after #WonderWoman and #Aquaman.

"882","SO I watched Shazam with my friends and we loved it. 
I was waiting for this movie since @ponysmasher was announced as the director, @ZacharyLevi and @AsherAngel were cast and the wait was worth it.

The movie is super fun but also has a lot of heart. GO, WATCH IT!"

"898","Saw #Shazam Kind of like Deadpool and Captain Marvel w/ a little Spiderman thrown in, but less funny and epic. Felt like a superhero movie from 2 years ago. Fun &amp; silly, but a little boring. Far &amp; away the best DC film. 7.25/10. #marvelisstillbetter #djimonhounsouiseverysuperhero"
"899","#Shazam ... better than #CaptainMarvel . Sorry, @MarvelStudios, but @TheDCUniverse got you this time. You'll rebound with #AvengersEndgame, no doubt, but DC seems to have started figuring the formula out."
"900","@boymonster Sure. And the kid would probably be fine, but why waste the ticket money on the chance? We'll hit Secret Life Of Pets 2 in the theater and save Shazam for Redbox. World keeps spinning.

Thanks again."
"901","@boymonster I have a 5yo and we were debating whether to go. The Wizard of Oz wasn't a huge problem; would you say Shazam is more or less scary than that? And for how long?"
"902","Shazam looks wack. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are the best things to come out of the current DC universe."
"903","Just saw Shazam, can confirm it is in fact a Christmas movie"
"904","I just watched and really enjoyed #Shazam ^_^ I also really like how they portrayed and explored family. Not biological family, just family. And *breathes in* Thank You So Much For Representing So Many Minorities Including Disabled People THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU <U+0669>(<U+02C3><U+0336><U+0348>`<U+0BF0><U+02C2><U+0336><U+0348>´)<U+0648>"
"905","This is fantastic! Keep Shazaming PERSONA as we prepare for the CB and the release of the title track. Shazam will be critical for getting radio play. BTSonShazam is a great resource for learning about Shazam. 

#MAP_OF_THE_SOUL_PERSONA @BTS_twt"
"906","It’s good but it’s too kiddy for me. I don’t need every movie dark but sometimes they over do it with the jokes"
"907","That's for explaining the movie and location pin the TL. 
I should watch it"
"908","Billy Batson I choose you! #Shazam in a few"
"909","@ShazamMovie Lives up to the hype!! So much fun! Will be seeing this in theatres again!! <U+26A1><U+26A1> #Shazam"
"910","@ShazamMovie Lives up to the hype!! So much fun! Will be seeing this in theatres again!! <U+26A1><U+26A1>"
"911","I’m not head over heels with Shazam because I feel like a lot of inherent storytelling problems with DCEU movies still fester their way into the film, but man this movie has one absolutely vital thing that the others don’t: a soul.

actually two: really fucking great peformances"
"912","i'm convinced that everyone has at least a few slam dunk words they use in an essay to give it that extra shazam not really knowing for sure what they mean... like personally i fuck with 'leverages,' 'underpins' and my silver bullet, 'consolidates' #furthermore"
"913","@oneshadowlove It’s cool but Shazam is to badass for his movie to be a comedy"
"914","Shazam! Review:
- SUPER fun movie
- Funny jokes (not all of them land)
- CGI is (very) questionable 
- Great twists throughout 
- Would recommend watching in theaters (sound is incredible)"
"915","Me and Naomi were watching Shazam and this group of teens wouldn’t stop whispering among themselves and laughing I wanted to be mad but I remember that was literally me and my friends in high school <U+0001F602>"
"916","Btw go see @ShazamMovie It’s funny as hell and a great movie"
"917","@GayComicGeek @ShazamMovie @DCComics @MANX38 @chriscwik1 I thought it was fun and light which is god. The DC movies have been very heavy. I'm glad I saw it."
"918","I just watched it, and it’s such an amazing movie!!!! #SHAZAM"
"919","Who’s up for going to see Shazam AND Pet Sematary tomorrow when I get off work?"
"920","“Absolutely super.” #SHAZAM! is NOW PLAYING in theaters!"
"921","Just saw #ShazamMovie Definitely one of my top three favorite DC movies!!! If you are looking for a movie with a lot of heart and a lot of laughs I highly recommend it! You won’t be disappointed!"
"922","Shazam is best of DC movies (other than the Nolan Batman movies, of course)"
"923","@ZacharyLevi #shazam was a great movie
Its now one of my top favorite Superhero movies
I reccomend watching the movie
So funny and awesome and I dont say that about any movie, it has to wow me
And IT DID"
"924","we’re going to see shazam tonight :o"
"925","Watching Shazam today . It's called the best DC superhero movie since DCEU came into existence , I hope it lives up to it cause the last movie that got the tag sucked ass"
"926","How did I not notice that @ShazamMovie takes place in #Philly ?"
"927","We just got back from seeing this. My wife and I loved every second of this movie. It was easily one of the most fun movies I’ve seen in a while"
"928","Shazam! Hillarious and Funny. Teach us on family’s relationship. <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>"

"930","I’m wearing a Flash shirt cuz it’s the closest thing I have to a yellow lightning bolt #ShazamMovie"
"931","I’m really glad flossing Shazam exists"
"932","I literally spent almost a whole month without watching any movie until shazam huh"
"933","@GraceRandolph #Shazam was a risk of a film to make by DC/WB, he isn’t that well known of a character, plus a lot of people I know thought it looked too dorky or kiddish. I’ll see it for sure, but I’m at the cinema now, people are watching #Dumbo &amp; #CaptainMarvel still <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"934","@AshCrossan @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Where is the mug I painted for you?"
"935","#ShazamMovie was SO GOOD. The casting all around was absolute perfection. The pacing was perfect. It emotionally destroys you and then builds you back up. I loved it so much."
"936","Looks like I'll be wrong on the over for #Shazam. Crazy. Thought it would do much bigger numbers."
"937","Just got back from #ShazamMovie and it was such a fun time. A great movie that just revels in being fun and exciting. It’s never been so fun watching people figure out they have superpowers."
"938","Shazam! (2019): In a genre that is bursting at the seems, Shazam! has the Herculean task of separating itself from the rest, and it does. Shazam brings lots of silliness and fun to an ecosystem full of brooding tough guys. However, it does fall short in balancing it's tones. 8/10"
"939","“friends” going to see Shazam without me. They aren’t my friends"
"940","I had to wipe away a tear of pride for @ZacharyLevi for his top billing in #SHAZAM. It was amazing! He was/is amazing! The cast was fabulous! High expectations were met and surpassed!"
"941","So now there’s a movie called Shazam? As if it wasn’t bad enough that the statistical software SHAZAM already shared the name with the music app. The stats software just needs to rebrand"
"942","#ShazamMovie #Shazam at 9:10 all I have to say is, SHAZAM!!"
"943","Wow! @ShazamMovie was marvelous! Some great iconic moments. Congrats @adamschlagman! #Shazam"
"944","Incredible film. It was joyous. Pure joy. And I loved how dark it got. It scared me a few times. Bless the LORD for creating @ZacharyLevi who was born for this role. The entire cast was great. Great job @ponysmasher Cannot wait to see it again. #Shazam"
"945","@ZacharyLevi Our family did and we had the best time! Go see @ShazamMovie"
"946","<U+2666>I just want to say, that everyone has their Batman, Captain Marvel Wonder Woman, Shazam, Superman, etc...We all have our favorite comic characters, and none of us are wrong. DCEU and Marvel..We all love what we love together AND in peace. #DCEU #Marvel"
"947","go out and watch Shazam! this weekend, my friends"
"948","i’m seeing shazam tomorrow <U+0001F497><U+0001F498><U+0001F496>"
"949","Shazam has a very subtle Big reference for those of you that are cultured bc they’re both movies that have kids becoming adults"
"950","Shazam! was one of the most fun superhero movies since Into The Spider-Verse. Zachary Levi and Asher Angel are amazing as Billy/Shazam, Mark Strong as Dr. Sivana is the best DCEU villain by far and as well rounded as Thanos. Definitely will see multiple times"
"951","1) Technically, Dwayne Johnson DOES make a mid-credit appearance
2) No, but the next best thing."
"952","Well! @ShazamMovie was really fun and it was great to be in a theater full of people laughing. Also there’s a part near the end with Freddie that I just absolutely loved but I don’t want to give it away! Just know it’s great casting all around and I’m happy for @ZacharyLevi!"
"953","Gonna watch #Shazam bc it actually really does look enjoyable unlike almost every other dc movie lately <U+0001F602>"
"954","Shazam was great. I don't think I've ever laughed so much at a DC film as great as this. Even if you're not a fan of DC's more recent films, you can easily get some enjoyment out of this one, cause it really doesn't take itself too seriously compared to previous DC films."
"955","Wooow I am thoroughly surprised at how much I enjoyed ‘Shazam’!"
"956","Hopefully  #PetSematary is good <U+0001F612>.. watching that over Shazam"
"957","@ryno1185 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie We just finished seeing it too! Loved it! So much heart, great family story with action &amp; humor. Awesome movie!"
"958","@almosteducate @VCCassidy Take their kitty to see Shazam. Problem solved."
"959","@jcnahgui Excuse you, Shazam and the man who killed Don Quixote are out this week."
"960","Shazam was so fresh funny and brilliant so different from the others DCEU films Zachary is awesome aka the real Captain Marvel!...loved the end credit scene!!! <U+0001F643>"
"961","You guys go and see #Shazam"
"962","Avoided all spoilers, trailers, casting, and other details for SHAZAM. It did the thing I wanted it to do, but figured it was too scared to try it. It was also funny and upbeat in the way that every comic book hero movie oughta be. See it."
"963","So... #Shazam 
Zachary Levi acting like a 14yo with superpowers: super nice.
CGI is pretty cool in general but goofy in some parts.
Pretty funny and entertaining movie, nice cast and acting.
And finally, Mark Strong as villain with super cool outfit? BIG YES"
"964","Well the 2/3rds of #Shazam! that I saw before @AMCTheatres had to shut down the theater was hilarious and fantastic.

So annoyed right now."
"965","who knows the name of the song that played at the end of unicorn store? who is it by? i tried shazam and google and girl... I got nothing"
"966","Can’t wait to get home and see Shazam with @taylorkriho"
"967","Props to @ShazamMovie for helping me realize how much I’d love to foster a kid one day! Well played @ZacharyLevi well played"
"968","@NothinOffensive @BlackWarGreymon I don't fucking know about Shazam and I am SO GLAD I googled that shit before I went in

Fucking amazing I can't believe they're backing something that dumb I love it"
"969","It was amazing and I loved your acting in it!"
"970","I liked #ShazamMovie more than I expected."
"971","Heading off to see Shazam! Let’s see how much my hometown gets destroyed."
"972","@carsonlueders Going to the movies with family to see @ShazamMovie"
"973","Thank you to Museum of Intrigue(@escapetheestate), @PWATDeWittNY, &amp; @FrightmareFarms, who Proudly Present this video to You!"
"974","Just saw Captain Marvel!  Er...scuse me, the ORIGINAL Captain Marvel, #Shazam!  One of the best movies I've seen in a while!  Great story, great message and tons of laughable moments!  I highly recommend it!"
"975","So, Shazam! is good. Very funny and wholesome. Villain is extremely mediocre but has some good moments. This is probably DC’s Ant-Man."
"976","If only that were the case"
"977","@TheOnlyWarman I just saw shazam and it's entertaining but not amazing. As for don quixote, didn't know it's coming soon.. BUT im super excited for Rocket Man but not sure when it's gonna premiere"
"978","Shazam is the second best dc movie behind the dark knight"
"979","I didn’t even know Shazam was made into a movie. DC really need a better marketing campaign"
"980","But also, find it interesting that Shazam is out Cap Marvel is out since they have similar powers and everything <U+0001F914>"
"981","About to check out Shazam. Opinion coming in about 2 hours."
"982","About to go check out Shazam. Opinion coming in about 3 hours."
"983","Shazam was really fun! Really enjoyed it; definitely laughed a lot haha. It was a really nice light hearted movie compared to how uhhh dark DC movies can be lol. Child actors were surprisingly pretty good too. Villain was only okay though, but the movie was overall super fun."
"984","@KTHdatabase @Shazam Hello @Shazam @BTSonShazam
Would you please change the video linked to @BTS_twt’s Singularity to the official MV? the one you currently have is a lyric video (non official) 

This is the official MV link tht shd be linked When Singularity is shazamed

first of all i love stories about families, and even more about adopted families!!!!! and all the kids were great!!!!! the couple~~~ loving mom and dad <U+0001F62D><U+0001F495>"
"990","Seeing #Shazam made me pretty happy to be named Billy. Thanks, @ZacharyLevi and @AsherAngel!"
"991","Shazam might be the worst superhero movie I’ve seen"
"992","In the movies watching #Shazam :)"
"993","My people that live on another block have their music so loud I can Shazam it from my house"
"994","I took the kid to see Shazam and it was surprisingly really good"
"995","no spoilers and jack is gross but zachary, asher, jack, and everyone else hit it out of the park"
"996","@ the person who kept saying ""mood"" and ""same"" and ""me"" in the theater all throughout Shazam:
You are very pure have a good day"
"997","@AsherAngel Great job in @ShazamMovie! What a funny, very entertaining film. Best DC film I have seen so far and I am looking forward to seeing where your career goes in the future. Keep up the great work!  #ShazamMovie"
"998","Seen it twice already and it just gets better the second time around. Hoping to see you and @TheRock go toe to toe at some point, not to mention a certain diminutive Venusian. Thank you!"
"999","@PleaseStopRyan @BlackWarGreymon I loved the not so subtle symbolism of the kid dropping his Batman and Superman toys when he sees Shazam do a cool thing lol

I'm kinda sad I know next to nothing about it other than Black Adam is a character. I liked how much subtle character building they did tho, like water"
"1000","@ryno1185 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Jack Grazer was great as Freddy, and looking forward to seeing more from him, after being chased by IT <U+0001F921> as Eddie and playing a younger version Timothee Chalamet’s character in Beautiful Boy."
"1001","The only Shazam I want to see is the one Sinbad apparently never did in this universe. Take me back tbh"
"1002","@TheDreadfulLord @louispierreGg @TheMickeyM @MichaelF788 @DEADLINE Newsflash ...... Shazam isn’t Jumanji. Completely different movie and scenario as far as release dates go."
"1003","Gonna see it in about 2 hours with the kids!! Shazam!!!!"
"1004","@ShazamMovie made up for how shit Justice League was. Thank you. Amazing job."
"1005","MOVIE GOOF: After the wizard, Shazam, tells Billy to he’s giving him Solomon’s genius, Hercules’ strength, Atlas’ stamina, Zeus’ power, Achilles’ courage &amp; Mercury’s speed, he doesn’t tell him that Jesus is the true God and you don’t need super powers to be his champion"
"1006","Shazam was really fun! Reminds me a lot of early superhero movies from my childhood... but, like, the good ones."
"1007","Just saw #Shazam, and it’s got equal parts emotional heft, humor and superhero action. I honestly was surprised how affecting it was, in spots. Oh, and Zachary Levi is freaking incredible in the role. Whenever I hear the words Shazam in the future, I’ll think of him."
"1008","@AsherAngel You were SO great in @ShazamMovie !!! Very proud of you! <U+0001F62D>"
"1009","I want everyone on Twitter to know the @ShazamMovie is lots of fun.  One emotional moment almost made me cry.  I want to be best friends with @ZacharyLevi"
"1010","I'm glad to hear that the Shazam movie has been enjoyed by so many.  I remember watching and loving the tv show when I was a kid.  I don't go to see many movies - especially superhero movies (which are usually pretty bad these days) - but I want to see this one. <U+0001F44D>"
"1011","My only criticism of Shazam are
the weak villain who ends his story arc halfway through the film
the bad cgi lmao"
"1012","Shazam was good I liked it! Which is surprising bc I hã<U+021B>ë superhero movies"
"1013","I had popcorn for dinner and saw #Shazam with @ZacharyLevi. I’d say so far I’m batting a thousand this weekend. What next?"
"1014","Saw Shazam with @Shusky0 and @HeyoItsBeio !! Was really fun and a good movie :D Lots of laughs!"
"1015","I will say, though i rated #shazam 6/10, i do think it’s the best DC movie of the new era of DC movies."
"1016","@ShazamMovie was really excellent. Every second was good. Lots of heart, good and solid story, exactly the right amount of genuine laugh-out-loud humor, FANTASTIC villain...I loved it, all of it. So dang good."

"1022","Bruh this movie !!!!!"
"1023","Seeing @ShazamMovie. Hoping it’s as good as the trailers would lead one to believe!"
"1024","@obemma44 You clearly didn’t watch aquaman, it is nowhere near as entertaining as aquaman. Shazam was boring compared aquaman, it was almost below average but I trust a sequel will be better, they need to turn up the action a bit"
"1025","Also, the lower budget may sound promising but it is a cheap-looking film. Minus the Shazam! costume it's visually very boring...

This film has kinda baffled me, there are good aspects to it but DC could have made this so much better!"
"1026","@GiteshPandya Lol Shazam didn’t even get the first place in Chinese box office,only 6.8 scores from Douban wom is terrible."
"1027","Shazam was kind of boring, Rotten Tomatoes didn't get this one right. a few laughs, passable CGI and Meagan Good. and the new suit of course.

mehhhh"
"1028","Casting Adam Brody as Jack Dylan Grazer’s older version was literally the BEST decision, they’re one and the same #Shazam"
"1029","i would like to adopt all the young cast from Shazam"
"1030","The montage in Shazam when they’re trying Billy’s powers while “don’t stop me now” plays, MY BRAND"
"1031","I gonna give a quick PSA about a movie.

Dont expect much from Shazam.

Just enjoy the cruise of childish, cringy and fun journey of young boy to pursuit in evoke the true potential of champion power.

TLDR, a light version of DC movie."
"1032","@ShazamMovie was amazing! Solid entry to dc regardless your opinion of past movies, solid story and message and my boii @ZacharyLevi bring that Chuck epicness with the story that makes the live even better! Now give me that Henry Cavil &amp; @BenAffleck cameo we all want! Someday <U+0001F62D>"

"1034","@ChadLarsson @MatthewNinaber Why would they make a serious Shazam movie? They weren’t taking a page from Marvel"
"1035","Not only is Shazam! a shitty superhero movie, it's a shitty movie in general. I have list of reasons if you need it."
"1036","#Shazam has a lot of heart and brought the feels! Not the movie I expected, but so much better! Honestly, it’s probably my favorite solo superhero movie. It’s definitely the best origin movie. Bring on the sequel!"
"1037","Into The Spider-Verse would like a word."
"1038","i ended up really sick so i’m not seeing shazam tonight :( but i’m sitting with a kitten and watching the unicorn store so :)"
"1039","Depends.. if you're a fan of Rami's Spider-Man 1 &amp; Venom, you'll probably like it. Its very comedic but it's done naturally I'd say."
"1040","Super FACTS. I see on the DC side too. #SHAZAM was really good and I got my tickets to #AvengersEndgame ready."
"1041","#SHAZAM 3rd act is just.... so fulfilling to watch. The whole time I'm thinking ""are they gonna do it... are they gonna do it... are they gonna do it.."" &amp; they f***'n did it."
"1042","Shazam was a total blast! Lots of heart, humor, action, and a ton of fun.  Best DC movie in a while (haven’t seen Aquaman yet). Hopefully it’s success will put DC back on track to making solid movies again."
"1043","Go see @ShazamMovie right now. Great work to all involved. @ZacharyLevi you were PERFECT in the role. Congratulations on a movie well made my man."
"1044","YESSSS

Definitely recommend to watch this movie!"
"1045","I give #SHAZAM a ""B"". It has its moments of laughter. I can see #BlackAdam becoming a villain in a sequel"

"1047","My review on shazam: it was alright. I liked the gas station scene and there were parts that were funny. However, considering it was a hero type movie, the whole villain thing was kind of expected and the fight just seemed dragging to watch because you already know how it's gonna"
"1048","Shazam is such a freakin welcome breath of fresh air that dc needed"
"1049","going to see shazam!!!"
"1050","@ZacharyLevi - just saw Shazam! Probably my favourite DC movie so far! Cant wait for what's next to come."
"1051","Bouta go see Shazam and spend $15 on nachos cause I'm caked bitch"
"1052","My favorite part of Shazam is probably the running joke involving Santa Claus."
"1053","More people sang along to Don’t Stop Me Now in the theater just now for Shazam! than they did during opening night of Bohemian Rhapsody"
"1054","okay what we’re NOT gonna do is have grown ass women have crushes on asher and jack bc of shazam. there are SO many beautiful men in their 20’s,, to crush on them, you predators"
"1055","Just saw @ShazamMovie and my biggest takeaway is that I really want people like that foster family to exist. I hope they do and, if they do, they rock."
"1056","You got: Shazam!
Despite your tough outer-shell, you're a child at heart who would go out of your way to help others. You're a brave individual who willingly accepts new challenges, even if the outcome is bleak and uncertain. Just say the word... you're Shazam!"
"1057","Recommend it? I'm thinking I'ma watch it Tuesday"
"1058","@jake279 @GraceRandolph I figured, I assumed Shazam! was catered more to American audiences. They really should’ve made more trailers to convince other markets."
"1059","#Shazam was actually a really good movie. My son &amp; I both enjoyed it. Say my name."
"1060","The best friend hyping up Shazam was very reminiscent of the @PSoup_ / Spidey NIU days"
"1061","timmy mutuals go see shazam in theatres now"
"1062","Shazam was a lot of fun. Zachary Levi was PERFECT in the role."
"1063","Just went to the movies with my bro to see Shazam, so jealous of all these high schoolers / middle schoolers on dates<U+0001F622> I feel like I missed out"
"1064","Shazam was really good. Big fun not serious movie. Trailers don't show most of the movie too so that's a big surprise."
"1065","SHAZAM WAS AMAZINGGGGG @AsherAngel i’m proud of u"
"1066","What's that? Wonder Women, Aqua man, Shazam are decent to good films and draws in audiences without name sake alone? Maybe you shouldn't have Zack Butt Fuck Snyder direct your goddamn movies. #Shazam"
"1067","Mr @TheRock, just watched #ShazamMovie and we need your #BlackAdam movie soon (and for you to fight #Shazam . Please make it happen."
"1068","Watched #Shazam . Liked it. Laughed a lot. However, I'm not the greatest fan that this movie is essentially like a Marvel movie. I missed the grand epicness of DC's movies. Initial grade on the (new) #Torometro: 7.6."
"1069","I’ll give Shazam a 6/10. It’s good but sometimes it felt off. I know the film wanted me to feel certain emotions but the scenes didn’t flow currently for me."
"1070","I watched Shazam to see Seth Cohen from the OC and the adorable kid from IT"
"1071","@ShazamMovie the sequel should have the foster dad, but he turns into @TheRock"
"1072","I’m not usually into DC but @ShazamMovie was amazing! @ZacharyLevi did an amazing job! It was enjoyable and entertaining the entire time and i never lost interest for a second!"
"1073","Shazam! Is magical! Hearkens back to the Goonies. Great writing and casting. <U+2661>"
"1074","SHAZAM is a solid 10/10. Highly recommend."
"1075","seeing Shazam again time to cry"
"1076","Seriously tho, after that billion dollar wave of .Aquaman then the refreshingly joyful Shazam!, Now this, insanely freaky take on Joker. DC is really on the rise. And with the soon to be expanding MCU now with Fox on board, It's a great time to be a superhero movie fan."
"1077","@ZacharyLevi I have been following you for years, since Chuck, through Nerd HQ, and I can say that Shazam is some of your best work, congrats on the awesome movie!!"

"1080","@thuggie_life @YouTube nooo. i'm not skilled like that. there's a review channel on youtube called Double Toasted. some of the funniest content i've ever heard comes from them. warning, if you do check them out, they are unapologetically adult and speak as they are. this is their review of Shazam!"
"1081","I saw Shazam and it was fun and good and DC should take the hint and continue to make movies that are both fun and good sorry if I'm being too controversial but I like movies that are fun and good."
"1082","Was the Shazam movie worth seeing in theaters ???"
"1083","I then went and watched Captain Marvel again because making good life choices.
Tomorrow Shazam and my Tigers in the Final Four! Go sports ball!"
"1084","After I’ve let in marinate for a while, I’d give Shazam a 7/10, decent movie,"
"1085","i’m about to watch shazam and i’m so excited!!!!"
"1086","@M1ckyMack Not going to spoil anything, but I'll just say that I've seen something from Shazam that further supports your concern... but I agree, they were both excellent in the roles and it's a shame they weren't given better material (personally I enjoyed Man of Steel, but not the others)"
"1087","After a second viewing, I can now 100% confirm that Shazam is the best dceu movie and so far my favorite film of 2019"
"1088","Watched #Shazam earlier today and was so pleased with the result! I’m glad there was any romance and focused on the story and the importance of family and friends. Truly amazing!"
"1089","/minor shazam spoilers
//big tw for shazam movie ! in the beginning of the movie there is a very intense car crash, so if ur uncomfy with that please watch cautiously ! a couple other tw-worthy scenes: woman is burnt alive, head is bit off, monster with teeth in stomach. u can dm"
"1090","no y’all fr shazam doesn’t have any right to be as good as it is pls go watch it"
"1091","i went to see #shazam expecting a dumb superhero movie but got instead a genuinely funny story about found families wtf y’all"
"1092","I just seen the movie Shazam! It was awesome! DC has finally made a movie that fans really wanted since Wonder Woman. Don't get me wrong I liked all of the other DCEU movies as well, but Shazam really defines what superheroe movies are supposed to be like #DC"
"1093","@TheGrouponDon It's not. Believe me. I wanted it to be. I watched it three times to make sure and it's just....awful. DC <U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FE> but apparently Shazam is good."
"1094","Shazam what a fun movie really entertaining lots of action too"
"1095","Should’ve dressed like a real superhero though. SHAZAM!

#NXTTakeOver"
"1096","Shazam might be my new favorite superhero movie. Zachary Levi was born to play that role."
"1097","Off to see SHAZAM!"
"1098","Hey @jimmyfallon you and @ZacharyLevi are twins. Just saw #Shazam and you both look very similar and have same mannerisms.  I think jimmy needs to become a superhero"
"1099","Saw #SHAZAM today. Wow... I guess it's the best movie of its universe. Literally i almost peed coz couldn't stop laughing."
"1100","Waiting to go watch #Shazam"
"1101","Shazam surprised me omg it was so hilarious and the story was compelling like it was such a cute movie, theres honestly not a dull moment yall go see it!!!!"
"1102","explain to me which part of shazam is “trying so hard to be deadpool”. he’s a 14 year old kid. the story is based on the new 52 comic with some changes

dont start the whole “copying” thing. DC characters were created first. please look up when these characters were created"
"1103","@NintenZ I think the main deal is they’re for two different audiences: Shazam more for kids while CM is for teenage/adult women.
(Obviously you don’t have to fit either of those to enjoy the movie, I watch Miraculous Ladybug and that’s for like 5 year olds I think lol)"
"1104","Really wasn’t expecting Shazam to be that good <U+0001F914>"
"1105","The Last scene. Lol. So good.  Loved Shazam!!!!"
"1106","The next podcast should be rather interesting...we will be talking #Bloodrayne and #SavingPrivateRyan, #BSG, #PetSematary and #Shazam"
"1107","Legend by Twenty One Pilots is in Shazam the movie deserves best picture. Yeah they had a song in Suicide Squad but that one sucked"
"1108","@MarkAWLynch Shazam was good, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The DC movies aren't the best but they are fun."
"1109","I can finally release my Shazam Review today <U+0001F605> Been waiting since the 25th of March!! #Shazam"
"1110","The guy next to me fell asleep in the first 10 min of Shazam and didn't wake up till the last fight scene explosion. Never have I seen anyone look more confused in my life"
"1111","shazam is such a good movie, i don’t really like dc but this was amazing. it’s funny and interesting and i loved it so much which i really didn’t expect, i only wanted to see shazam cause one of my favorite actors was in it but i ended up loving the who fucking movie"
"1112","Had a hunch the old wizard in #Shazam was black.. What I didn't expect was for him to be Kree <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> DC &amp; Marvel clearly wanted these movies to rip each others throats out which is fine because their competitiveness is what makes them both such great industries. Casuals don't get it."
"1113","@flavioeldritch @Ssaaee1237676 They have careers ahead of them, including more Shazam movies hopefully."
"1114","Apparently Sony fanboys are triggered over the fact that #Shazam plays Mortal Kombat X on Xbox.
Are you really that defensive over a piece of plastic?
And you are the ones who call Xbox FANS ""corporate slaves.""
#Hypocrites"
"1115","#Shazam is far and away the best DC super hero movie they have made in possibly ever"
"1116","AGDJCUSJAGAH my brother ask me to buy ticket with his m-t*x account (we plan to watch shazam today) then realize the acc is still held by ex girlfriend I'M HOWLING <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"1117","And if the strange pair of 40-50ish men in business casual attire that just sat on my row at this showing of Shazam are reading this this is definitely about you."
"1118","Before the Shazam review drops tomorrow I need your guy's opinion. Do you guys want it in 720p with the watermark or standard 360p without the watermark?"
"1119","Shazam! 
But instead of gaining super powers my penis grows to 14""...flaccid"
"1120","#Shazam was AMAZING!!!! Or should I say ELECTRIFYING! My son and I loved every minute of this movie. We are fans!"
"1121","@CastiRojas21 @Melvingordon25 Eh you can’t say that. Wonder Woman and aquaman was pretty much better than everything marvel did except for the 2 good captain America films. Jl, ss and bvs were the bad films and now Shazam but people will praise Shazam because it’s a kid friendly movie"
"1122","Finally seeing Captain Marvel, although SHAZAM did look enticing to go see."
"1123","@Blaghman Personally, probably wrong, I feel it's part of DC's realisation that comics are inherently stupid and it's time to embrace that. MCU has the play it straight thing and no one wants gritty. With Shazam being reviewed so well and how great Doom Patrol is, they've found their space"
"1124","Shazam was dreck. It was too long, all the funny was in the trailer and the cgi was dodgy. I found most of the performances grating."
"1125","FYI ""Shazam"" was great. More of that please DCEU powers that be."
"1126","@JoeyCicch @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi I'm an equal opportunity comic geek...easily the most fun comic movie, it had it all."
"1127","I think we have a new top DC movie! Aquaman was good but #Shazam was better. To all those that unfairly criticized DC in the past, check that movie out. Blows any recycled/same old storyline Marvel movie out of the water. Humor, action, and wholesome underlying themes."
"1128","#ShazamMovie is totally worth seeing! I didn’t think I was going to like it. I absolutely love this movie. I laughed so much!"
"1129","@ZacharyLevi I saw it on March 23 and I am seeing it again on Saturday. I am so excited to see it again. This movie has heart and it is pure joy. Zac the role of Shazam was destined to be yours. Asher was meant to play Billy. This movie happened at the right time for everyone involved."
"1130","So #ShazamMovie might be good, but if you've actually seen either the '78 Superman or the '89 Batman film, you can't say #Shazam is ""the best DC movie ever"" with a straight face.

Also, if you haven't seen the aforementioned films, you can't be taken seriously, anyway."
"1131","Elijah been buggin about Shazam! so we at the movies tonight <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD>"
"1132","Been hearing mixed reviews about Shazam"
"1133","I just watched Shazam and I kid you not it’s one of the best superhero movies I’ve ever seen. The cast was fucking awesome and nailed everything. @ZacharyLevi LOVE YOU MATE"
"1134","Me during the movie literally"
"1135","guys im in the theater rn abt to watch shazam and half of it is for legend being in the movie we-"
"1136","I legit want to see Pet Semetary and Shazam"
"1137","Shazam was fun! And I swear one specific moment was a minor reference to fma"
"1138","The best movie evah <U+0001F924><U+0001F389>"
"1139","Something I never knew exsisted and also something I never knew I needed until now<U+0001F481><U+0001F3FB><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"1140","IMO Shazam is like a kid’s superhero movie <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> (maybe it really is)"
"1141","Guess who's flying solo later? #Shazam"
"1142","Just watched the Shazam movie and I liked it. But all I gotta say is YASSS @MeaganGood I literally screamed so loud when you appeared"
"1143","Ok Shazam was a great movie. Highly recommend it!"
"1144","@ZacharyLevi Saw it! Loved it! You killed it! Better than I even expected and I had high expectations! Will see it again and again! #Shazam #Shazammovie"
"1145","Blue tick hot takes on SHAZAM because it’s not in their favourite shilled franchise in 3...2..."

"1148","this song go so hard"
"1149","Shazam was hilarous, tone was a bit off, and no one can drive in Philadelphia. 7.5/10"
"1150","@ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel probably just won the hearts of millions of people <U+0001F44F> #shazam"
"1151","Just saw #SHAZAM and it was actually one of the best movies DC had to offer so far."
"1152","Shazam first day India box office collection 1.45 cr"
"1153","So, so, so much to unpack here."
"1154","Shazam did what the other DC movies couldn’t do..."
"1155","Ummm #IntoTheSpiderVerse would like to have a word with you about this headline @YahooEnt <U+0001F644>"
"1156","yes, yahoo is still a company that exists, though for what reason, I cannot tell you, if they just gonna act like Spiderverse and Black Panther didn't happen."
"1157","Gold star @ZacharyLevi and the rest of the cast of #Shazam ... loved it!"
"1158","#SHAZAM is very much in spirit to Christopher Reeve’s Superman. Funny, Charming, Stupid and packing a whole lot of heart. @ZacharyLevi was perfect as Captain SparkleFingers and the supporting cast was damn good!! You done good, DC.

#ShazamMovie #DC"
"1159","@ZacharyLevi Amazing !! Just returned home with the family from watching SHAZAM<U+26A1><U+FE0F>Loved it !! Really great special effects and A Gorgeous Action Hero !

"1162","watched shazam
i LOVE it so fucking much
god more of this please"
"1163","i love the cast, i love the plot, i LOVE the second half of the movie so goddamn much. it is definitely a different shazam from what a lot of fans are expecting, but it is a good one."
"1164","its ok nvm i’m gonna be extra and play this video on my laptop and shazam it from my phone because i have the mind of a mastermind"
"1165","Peep all the easter eggs in Shazam. Holy shit theres a lot"
"1166","The thing about Shazam is that it’s a) pretty good if a bit flawed in its pacing and b) further evidence that the idea of “comics ideas too weird for the screen” simply doesn’t exist anymore."
"1167","I have two modes: Shazam and dumbo"
"1168","This is so awesome. Have you seen this, @ZacharyLevi? @ponysmasher @"
"1169","“she drew shazam and JESUS!” pls zach i love u"
"1170","Went to watch shazam really good movie, also saw @JPin_ILL. That man swole with the suit"
"1171","#Shazam  Movie was good... but it was missing more action packed fighting scenes.."
"1172","Yeah I gave Shazam 5 stars because why not? Because I understand that it’s very hard for DC to make a good movie and they FINALLY did one #SHAZAM"
"1173","They did everything so well! They respected the colors of dc, the cast is AMAZING and the soundtrack too!!! #SHAZAM"
"1174","Okay but Shazam was actually really good - and one of the best DC films since The Dark Knight Rises?!"
"1175","@SilahHussain They’re vastly different movies - but Shazam is hilarious and has a huge heart."
"1176","Shazam slaps, crowd loves every second and I’m happy for it. Go out there and make something wholesome, sometimes the universes and big team-ups aren’t where the magic happens."
"1177","@Saicam_Films @marcbernardin @dpalm66 Do we have to mention other superhero movies every time you praise another? Bc that’s ridiculous. They’re pointing out Shazam is diverse one of the most diverse superhero movies to come along. There’s literally a superhero for everyone in this movie. Hell one might even be gay!"
"1178","@ZacharyLevi Supporting you Shazam!"
"1179","Y’all you can see and fully understand Shazam without seeing any other superhero movies go see Shazam it will put you in such a good mood."
"1180","Shazam is about to be lit"
"1181","@jimstinson @Russo_Brothers @ShazamMovie better movie by far, too bad they lost the rights to advertise him by his actual name"
"1182","For #Shazam 2, I hope DC marketing turns the @ShazamMovie twitter handle or make a separate new account into Freddie’s stan account and make Freddie tweet in character. And make threads about the Justice League and his research about superheroes. And him training Billy."
"1183","Absolutely loved #ShazamMovie. This movie has everything. Great casting, great villain, suspense, action and it’s hysterically funny. Can’t wait to bring the kids to see it."
"1184","Morning: My wife tells me to go watch #Shazam, ”I know you want to watch #PetSematary but I don’t like terror movie”, I said OK.

Night: the cinema guys cancelled Shazam projection for technical issues, we ended watching Pet Sematary.

That’s #KA in action maggots!"
"1185","@TheBlossomTwins @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @nbcchuck My ladies!!"
"1186","@ShazamMovie is one of the greatest superhero movies PERIOD 10/10"
"1187","Shazam just restored my faith in DC movies"
"1188","@ZacharyLevi Shazam was amazing! We laughed so hard! Really great movie!!"
"1189","If your kids are under 12 and you let them go to the cinema alone you're a bad parent. Just had the worst movie experience at #shazam because of this pack of little cunts. They were playing fortnite on their phone during the third act of the film. That's how bad it was."
"1190","#ShazamMovie I haven’t seen it yet but, how can anyone hate on a movie that is pretty much BIG (Tom Hanks) but with a superhero twist. Does anyone else agree who’ve seen it or not??"
"1191","Just saw Shazam. I personally give it a 7/10. I enjoyed AquaMan far more, but this was a really good movie too <U+0001F525>"
"1192","Many are describing Shazam! as a great kids movie and considering one particularly violent scene I’m forced to question what kind of messed up movies you watched as a kid."
"1193","Really loved Shazam, DC might just be back on track"
"1194","Just saw Shazam and just wow... that shit slaps"
"1195","I am seriously in love with Shazam. I feel bad for not looking into this character sooner. Now I just feel like I've found a character I relate to more than any character ever."
"1196","Real reason @ShazamMovie is awesome is cause the font they use. Gotta love me some futura. @ZacharyLevi"
"1197","omg shazam really gonna end up being the greatest superhero movie of all time huh like dc somehow did that..."
"1198","If I never say ""Shazam"" people will never know for sure if I'm not Shazam"
"1199","@AyaLisaCosplay @GMCpodcast I have literally heard nothing but incredible things from folks who went to advance screenings so I hope/expect it will do well after opening weekend. It isn't like Shazam/Captain Marvel is a big first stringer for DC, let's be real
..."
"1200","I’m confused and excited that Shazam! was actually amazing and hilarious?!"
"1201","Into the Spiderverse had black, white asian, and a cartoon pig. Probably more idk I haven’t watched it yet."
"1202","If you do go see #Shazam may I suggest go seeing it in IMAX because they show a 7 min scene of #GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters 
WOW what a mind blowing scene 
My most anticipated movie this year"
"1203","I love the mid credits scene! It’s great and sets up a villain that I love and will be awesome to see in a sequel!!!! #SHAZAM"
"1204","The DCEU is 3/3 with movies without Batman or Superman. Shazam is sooooo good."
"1205","You could make such a good Justice League movie now centered around Supes, WW, Aquaman &amp; Shazam. But nah, WB had to blow their load early."
"1206","about to watch Shazam and the trailers they're playing are all marvel movies! <U+0001F602>"
"1207","Night out to see #Shazam and really enjoyed it. I don’t know the character as well as I do others but it was a solid movie overall. Hopefully DC can continue producing quality movies."
"1208","Just saw #shazam - heart rate slowly going back to normal... <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> #readyforthesequel"

"1210","@OriginalFunko  can't wait to see the movie."
"1211","I think the last 25-30 min of Shazam is my soulmate."
"1212","I’m not gonna lie it really bugs me when people act like they know what they’re talking about. 

Aquaman is not a Marvel film 
Neither is Shazam so stop saying it’s the Marvel formula when you have clearly not read there comics. Thank You have a nice day."
"1213","finally seeing shazam tomorrow at 2"
"1214","For the first time in a very long time I want to go to the movies and see a double feature.  Shazam and Pet Semetary"
"1215","I am currently on my way to see Shazam, and for some reason the opposite side of the freeway suddenly became barren. Then all of a sudden the F***ing PRESIDENT passes by. Probably a once in a life time opportunity."
"1216","How long is april fools supposed to last"
"1217","Just got back from #Shazam.  It was worth the wait.  Very well done and fun overall."
"1218","Yoooooo!!!!! #ShazamMovie  was PERFECTION! I thought I had it figured out... but it was more than I expected! <U+0001F629><U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FE><U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FE> Definitely seeing this again soon!!"

"1225","dc has found their new champion !!
#Shazam"
"1226","the girl behind me in shazam was annoyed that the main villain had ""too much motivation"" and ""couldn't just be evil"" so if you're wondering how long it takes for a $25,000 degree in screenwriting to become relevant in real conversation, the answer is 5 years"
"1227","@JerryOrdway @ShazamMovie Does that mean he'll never be Captain Marvel again?"
"1228","so locals really wanna see shazam over endgame?? inch resting..."
"1229","#Shazam was a thrilling and exciting installment into the DCEU. I absolutely CANNOT WAIT to share my thoughts next week!!"

"1231","Shazam was probably the best. DC movie I’ve watched 10/10"
"1232","lmao i'm gonna go out on a limb and say it isn't even the most diverse superhero film of the last *six months*"
"1233","Ricochet is basically Maven if he's given special powers, ala SHAZAM
#NXTTakeOverNewYork"
"1234","Shazam will make its money back easy because the budget was low but it deserves to make even more.....preferably more than Justice League so that can remain the lowest grossing DCEU movie"
"1235","Ok Mr. @ZacharyLevi, about to watch #shazam !  You have never let me down good sir and I can't wait to see what you and everyone else involved has created!  I brought my whole Nerd Herd!"
"1236","@Acesoldia Yeah. Shazam was always the magic word he used to change though so I guess it makes sense. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie. Everything I've heard about it sounds good. :D"
"1237","@RobertJCrane I feel like I’m in the minority, I really enjoyed Suicide Squad. Glad to here Shazam is worth watching."
"1238","Ok but Shazam is such a heartwarming and hilarious movie."
"1239","My Shazam stocked with poss  samples tho"
"1240","can someone tell me why shazam had so many demonic symbols and the villian literally tried to be dajjal or some shit <U+0001F624>"

"1245","am I the only who saw Shazam’s trailer for the first time and went “OMG THATS CHUCK!!!” ?"
"1246","Thank you for not acknowledging JL, that movie should never be on anyone’s DC list, unless it’s the SC."
"1247","*blinks in it’s glaringly obvious you haven’t watched Shazam if you don’t think it’s diverse*"
"1248","@Sinatra_Says Have you seen Shazam? Saw that one and it was awesome! Highly recommend it..."

"1250","Alright, not gonna lie Shazam is my second favorite new DC movie. This surprises me but it was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed it. #ShazamMovie"
"1251","Saw Shazam, it is a fun movie.
My DC rank would probably put it 3rd, under Wonderman and Aquaman.
I think it helped that it was a superhero I knew nothing about prior to the movie, so I had 0 expectations of what it could be."
"1252","Avengers End Game WHO??!! Shazam is the only superhero movie worth your time this month!!!"
"1253","Shazam was and I cannot stress this enough amazing"

"1265","Uhhhhhhh... first?

Just keep scrolling trough the comments section."
"1266","Saw Shazam! I really enjoyed it. The first DCEU movie that I have fully enjoyed beginning to end. Seems like they finally took some notes from Marvel on making an enjoyable super hero movie."
"1267","@DCComics finally getting it.
#shazam was good. light hearted and a family oriented theme. cant wait for next"
"1268","#Shazam is one of @DCComics best films to date; the Pagemaster meets Ant-Man in a fantastic blend of sweet humor and intense action. It hits all the right spots and suffers so few of the typical issues with prior films. Total breath of fresh air! Go see it!"
"1269","Shazam was quite honestly one of the worst movies i have seen in a hot minute"
"1270","First DC movie in a LONG while I enjoyed seeing and am planning on seeing it again, and even buying it. :) I really stand by the idea that this movie should be as Iron Man was for the MCU and be the base to build upon. Really awesome and fun movie with great performances &amp; depth."
"1271","Unplanned time by watching the movie and by going home late #Shazam"
"1272","Even in my 20s I still would of done that as well"
"1273","Just saw @ShazamMovie and let me say it was amazing! I totally recommend. @AsherAngel @ZacharyLevi @jackdgrazer"
"1274","So #SHAZAM is fantastic.  Easily the best DCEU movie from start to finish.  (Not a tall order I know). Cast is great, Billy and Freddie have wonderful chemistry. Has a couple of intense scenes that may scare younger kids.  3.5/4 <U+2B50><U+FE0F>"
"1275","Shazam was a top tier movie. Had comedy. A good storyline. Interesting details and was just overall a top tier movie. Legit loved it. Now to wait for the EndGame."
"1276","@ShazamMovie just saw the movie with my 8 year daughter and she can’t stop saying Shazam.  Really good movie. I highly recommend it."
"1277","@BobbyMovie are you going to release shazam"
"1278","Just got done watching Shazam! Thought it was a good movie, but I did find some parts of it hard to watch. Overall enjoyable experience, though I do find it a bit overrated, and there were some logistical issues I had with it. Still a fun time at the theaters! 7/10"
"1279","nursing school isnt asphyxiating us at all lately so im probably gonna see shazam tomorrow KSKSSKSK"
"1280","In my opinion Shazam! was bad, maybe my expectations were too high because it looked good in the trailers, DC should focus in making dark theme superheroe movies."
"1281","zachary levi went from eugene fitzherbert to shazam real quick"
"1282","Maybe I'm an ass hole but, what's even the point of referring to Shazam as Captain Marvel at this point? It serves very little purpose. Especially when talking to non comic people or people who are only now discovering the characters. Shazam is a cooler name anyways."
"1283","I liked that they never actaully gave “Shazam” a name the whole movie"
"1284","#Shazam rocking start us sneak preview and thursday-9mil $
Overseas-15mil$
China-16mil$ (greater than #Aquaman . Hope this is a big commercial &amp; critical hit for the #dceu"

"1286","let me tell you if DC keeps making movies like #WonderWoman #aquaman and #Shazam I might have a new favorite franchise instead of Marvel (#captainmarvel will still be top tier) #ShazamMovie"
"1287","My mother left me when I was three &amp; I found that she didn’t want me anymore when I grew up. A family took me though in high school of which I’m very grateful. Watching Shazam tonight became so surreal for me because I’ve been there before. I <U+2665><U+FE0F> the film. It made my cry. #Shazam"
"1288","Watching in just a bit!!"
"1289","Two great Captain Marvel movies in less than a month? Loved #ShazamMovie and T-3 weeks til #Endgame!!"
"1290","@minliangtan so there's a scene in Shazam! where one of the kids was playing on his laptop and raging on the microphone which happened to be the Razer Man O'War. The mic light was red/muted! The kid was screaming to no one! Can you let the producers know they messed up lol"
"1291","@NintenZ I mean, the film's called 'Shazam'. I wouldn't be surprised if that's intentional"
"1292","After a Long time, A Movie worth the Wait!! Thank You @DCComics for the best ever Captain Marvel movie. All those funny stuff pushed out boredom and unexciting stuff. Enjoyed every piece of the movie. @ZacharyLevi made the movie more awesome! A perfect #Shazam #DCComics"
"1293","#SHAZAM was the #CaptainMarvel movie I’ve been waiting for. Definitely one of the best DC movies they’ve done so far #Comics #DCComics"
"1294","Addition to my review: I should l have seen #Shazam again. 

#PetSematary"
"1295","@ElleofShalott Shazam made me cry hahaha. And I didn't love Pet Sematary, but I loved it whenever Lithgow was onscreen"
"1296","Saw #SHAZAM for a second time tonight and it’s just as good if not better than the first! This time I tried the 3D and was skeptical going into it because of the night/fog scenes, but holey moley they did it. Can’t wait to see it a third time."
"1297","I'd like to thank @SonnyBunch for recommemding Shazam.  

Quite cute, the best scene is when he gets shot in the face."
"1298","She would have the ability to turn us back into teenagers, living with our parents, with no bills, and the only worries being who was driving everyone to the mall on Friday night. #Shazam #ShazamXbox  #OppositeOfShazamWish"
"1299","... So Shazam was pretty good. I’m surprised by how good it was. Would definitely recommend it!"
"1300","Shazam! was awesome.  Mid and post credits scenes. #psa"
"1301","Movie 13 of 2019: Shazam<U+26A1>I loved it!! I have no background on the comics, I just thought the kid superhero premise was cute. I was unprepared for how much I would laugh during this movie! So many good lines, the found family was legit touching, and the ending <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D> Go see it!"
"1302","Shazam! is actually surprisingly good. first DC movie that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"1303","Shazam was surprisingly a great movie, 8.5/10"
"1304","Dear Mr @ponysmasher , why isn't there DC bumper before DC logo in #ShazamMovie ? I'm really curious."
"1305","@letstalktommie That Shazam and Spidey team up tho ;);)"
"1306","SHAZAM SPOILERS: Whomever forced sandberg to put a headless superman cameo with the williams music should not be running a studio. pointless.

"1311","@bradjenkins @YahooEnt I'm sure you haven't even watched the movie yet. This isn't a competition but Shazam has more diversity added just the fact that they included foster kids from different races, body types, a disable kid, that's literally more variety than spiderverse"
"1312","@ZacharyLevi I LOVED #Shazam @DCComics did there thing with this movie! Money well spent! GO SEE SHAZAM!"
"1313","Shazam being the most diverse Hero film, by definition, got people sick and confused lmao"
"1314","I gotta go see Shazam again. I really thought it was going to be 95% adapted from the New 52 story but it actually felt more like 85%, with some new things added here and there to change it up."
"1315","making my nightly ‘watch tangled the series if you can’ tweet in light of shazam being out in theatres and more people stanning zachary levi"
"1316","one big reason why SHAZAM! works is that it doesn’t seem like, and it’s not trying to be, a Marvel movie, but it doesn’t have to treat itself as a Very Adult movie."

"1325","Sorry.  Not watching #Shazam .. dont want to give @wbpictures any more $$$

I don't see how one can be a #ReleaseTheSnyderCut supporter and still go spend $$$ on WB DC movies..

Stop enabling this fucking studio.. your life won't end if u skip a few movies to make ur point.."

Cause I know what you'll compare it to.

Just. Fucking. DON'T."

"1332","Shazam had sooooo many black people in it.

I loved it."
"1333","Shazam was actually pretty good way better than I thought it would be"
"1334","@coleifornia_ every time this movie is mentioned i tend to only think about the music app, shazam"
"1335","@martynozz Aquaman was visually very appealing, but the dialog was so bad, and so many scenes were clunky and overacted that it was painful to watch. Shazam being a movie about family and what it means gave it depth that I didn't expect."
"1336","Sorry that Shazam didn’t parade around its diverse cast like some other movies do for woke points but that’s a major reason why the film is genuine because it shows that diversity is natural and doesn’t have to be exploited for recognition <U+0001F60C>"

"1340","@JerryOrdway @AngusRockford @ShazamMovie @petergkrause That was clear. It was a lot of fun and it was also my swan song on monthly comics. To be a part of such a great team probably won’t come again in comics. At least not for me. I will still do them and do but that’s the end of an era to me."
"1341","@ZacharyLevi I saw it tonight and thought it was amazing! Loved every minute of it! #Shazam"
"1342","So, I saw #Shazam. Holy shit it was amazing! The humor, action and, well heart. Go see it!"
"1343","I actually really liked it!"
"1344","@PrimeWayneNYC Facts man, I’m a huge fan of both marvel and dc. Shazam wasn’t a perfect film but it was nonetheless excellent"
"1345","1/2 So @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @ZacharyLevi and the rest of the car and crew of @ShazamMovie set a whole new standard for superhero movies (Marvel and DC). You could tell everyone involved was on it for the sake of making something worth watching and not a CEOs bonus."
"1346","Tbh it’s funny that Captain Marvel and Captain-Marvel-But-His-Name-Was-Changed-To-Shazam came out pretty close to each other but for the love of god stop treating them like one’s success disqualifies the other in some capacity"

"1349","Suffice to say Shazam is one of my favorite superhero movies now"
"1350","@ponysmasher I spotted a familiar “item” in #Shazam. You are one sneaky guy David. I plan on seeing the movie a lot more and catch the other Easter eggs you’ve hidden. <U+0001F609>"
"1351","Note: Aquaman and Shazam! are very damn close. I like the craft of Aquaman more but the story of Shazam! hit me harder. They’re both awesome. 

Second note: I forgot JL but I do like it."
"1352","@UberKryptonian I feel like he's too powerful for that. Having both WW and Shazam on the same team would be too OP."
"1353","SHAZAM is GREAT!! An absolute blast! Love the chemistry with @ZacharyLevi and the kids! Great action!"
"1354","I think one fatherhood’s peak moments is laughing with your kids at the same joke together. It’s a dialect of my relationship with my children that my father had with me. There’s nothing like it. Thanks again, @ZacharyLevi. #ShazamMovie"
"1355","Once the Shazam blu-ray is released
I would be unstoppable"
"1356","I was hesitant to watch Shazam, but it turned out to be a great movie. It was a strong 8/10"
"1357","I was already impressed with the Asher/Zach casting, but the Jack/Adam casting??? SERIOUSLY ON POINT. #Shazam"
"1358","I thought it reminded me a lot of Homecoming especially with that credits animation, which is not a bad thing at all"
"1359","Also Shazam! definitely seems to introduce an openly queer character into the DCEU and that’s extremely cool."

Enjoy Shazam!"
"1378","@victorymutt @KomangAgusAdi1 @clangprime @DanForinton @YahooEnt Shazam’s support/diverse characters easily had more screen time than the Spider-Verse’s support/diverse characters. Funny how people can’t see that and I LOVE both films. Why can’t we be happy that we got diverse films here. People saying Shazam isn’t diverse are stupid."
"1379","@damiankardona @GeoffThorne @YahooEnt This is proof that Shazam is way more diverse than Spider-Verse. Can’t wait to see my beautiful diverse cast in the sequel!!"

"1381","@geoffjohns Hi Geoff, I have an important question: Because Billy always turns into Shazam already in costume, and has those bathroom issues, is it possible for Shazam to be naked as an adult? Or is he permanently in the suit? Asking for @SYFYWIRE!"
"1382","@JerryOrdway I hope we get to see you doing something with Shazam! again. Even a cover art for the current run."

"1387","@SamShotFirst I don’t like doing the Marvel comparison thing b/c it’s not really fair to either, but if Aquaman is DC’s Thor Ragnarok then Shazam! is their Spider-Man."
"1388","Well no surprise here. Shazam! Is currently number 1 in my list of movies of 2019! Wonder of Endgame will change my mind or be the 2nd."
"1389","Yo questions did anyone catch what Pedro said in the 3rd act? Was DC confirming something or I'm just reaching #Shazam"
"1390","Since endgame is ruining us all emotionally go watch Shazam in theaters now!!!!!! Imagine not stanning billy... couldn’t be me<U+0001F60C>"

"1392","I know Shazam from young Justice and lemme tell ya.....
This one’s waaaayyy different
BOTH GOOD!!! But different"
"1393","@IanSim72 yes it was. DC and Marvel had a legal issue with it and now DC just refers to him as Shazam mostly."
"1394","I think the Mom Scene in Shazam was really good. A lot of people see parents through rose colored lenses or blame them for their problems but fail to realize they’re just people - sometimes very flawed people - that can make bad choices."
"1395","Bruh! Shazam was filmed in Philly! We officially have a superhero reppin' our city lol that's dope"
"1396","Good thing Shazam isn't a movie that needs to be explained afterwards, unlike movies from the MCU."

"1400","Shazam was a lot of fun

Actually recommend it"
"1401","If the MCU has humour as good as Shazam people wouldn’t complain. Humour or jokes aren’t bad if they’re natural and unforced. 

I’m not saying every MCU film has this problem but some of their Jokes have pauses so audiences can laugh. Or that’s what it feels like"

"1429","Said this in another tweet but I kinda hope they get the guy who wrote HP to wrote the sequel. I have never watched whole films but from the little I've seen, I feel like the writing in the movies, the dialogue etc. is something future Shazam movies could benefit from."

"1432","in the trailer. like seriously a lot. the third act was just a great payoff to what i and other shazam fans have speculated since the trailer. (i mean they named billy’s best bud freddy the filmmakers had to it.) this is seriously going to be the nerdiest movie of the year. (yes,"
"1433","was actually great across the board. plus, the direction was great. let’s just say that shazam plays like a comic book movie which was directed by the guy who did ‘lights out’ which it does. this is so far my favorite movie of 2019 and im pleasantly surprised that it is,"

"1475","@ZacharyLevi Talking my 4 year old to see it this weekend. He’s just as excited as I am! Congratulations on the movie!!! #SHAZAM"
"1476","Thought about the same."
"1477","So why didn't the rock show up in shazam?

negotiations w Garcia haven't worked out IMO"
"1478","The real question is...

Did they really have to make a new superman suit for shazam?"
"1479","Hoping for the next go around they get the guy(s) who wrote the HP films to write the sequels. I think those films have a balance of child/adult/magical elements that future Shazam movies can really learn from and adopt."
"1480","Holy shit, Shazam is closer to Abbey rated movie than Venom and I'm shocked. There's so much in that movie that made me genuinely question how in the world they got away with it."
"1481","Go see this movie<U+26A1> I did yesterday and it was SO CUTE and really good and HILARIOUS!!! @ZacharyLevi is so cute and has amazing timing. GO SEE @ShazamMovie"
"1482","Aaj $4m + for #Andhadhun <U+0001F44D> 
Fantastic growth as compared to other releases like #Shazam <U+0001F44D>"
"1483","Just got back, saw Shazam. I really enjoyed it! Its not perfect, but I enjoyed a lot of the performances, I laughed a decent amount, and if theres another Shazam movie in the future, I'm totally gonna see it."
"1484","Shazam is such a good movie omg!!!! <U+0001F49C><U+0001F49C><U+0001F49C> I was impressed. Now how to get the free comic book away from him <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> #Shazam"
"1485","I give the the Shazam Movie an
8.8 out of 10
Comedy was good,CGI looked a bit clunky sometimes,You could see it look pretty fake but it was watchable. The Action could have been alot better though.I felt they took the safe Route with this which is ok."
"1486","@colliderfrosty @IMAX I loved the movie!!! Shazam!"
"1487","I have no shame when it comes to enjoying movies. So, it is without shame that I tell you, I liked Shazam. It was funny. And fun. And exactly what I needed."
"1488","Went to go see, “Shazam”....  I hope you’re having a fun night out<U+0001F609>!!!!"
"1489","#SHAZAM is more colorful, more fun, more whimsical, more emotional and better than any Marvel Cinematic Universe film.

Fight me."
"1490","The movie pays so much respect to the rich mythology of this character.

Originally at Fawcett Comics they were developing six separate superheros, each with their own power from each god that makes up the SHAZAM moniker. But then it was changed to just one character.

#SHAZAM"
"1491","But again the colors of #Shazam are so vibrant it's unlike any #Marvel, in fact the movie it most resembles is Batman Forever &amp; in a really good way.

After all WB did invent the superhero movie and arguably perfected it with Batman Forever, taking what Burton did &amp; adding color."
"1492","Now the movie #SHAZAM takes all of those ideas and mixes them up with the perfect mixture.

The idea of six heroes, Shazam being the last one.
The idea of seven sins and SPOILERS Billy having to go through all seven before he can truly become the superhero he was meant to."
"1493","Best emotional moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for me are:

- Thanos sacrificing the one thing he loves 
- Villain in Civil War listening to a voicemail of his deceased loved one.
- Scott Lang not getting to see his kid.

And I think Shazam has all that all in one movie."
"1494","Best emotional moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for me are:

- Thanos sacrificing the one thing he loves 
- Villain in Civil War listening to a voicemail of his deceased loved one.
- Scott Lang not getting to see his kid.

And I think #Shazam has all of that in one movie!"
"1495","Dr. Sivana was really captivating. The whole idea of having a Wizard deem you unworthy as a child can really eff up your mental state growing up. Not to mention you could imagine how his Dad and brother treated him throughout his life. He’s the sympathetic character. #Shazam"
"1496","On a more positive note though,
Shazam is a pretty good film! Even for DC standards, it was great! Y'all should watch it."
"1497","I agree my #inox #inorbit looks a new born baby, but now it's so small baby we don't have the pop out posters of #shazam here. :("
"1498","@CBMHype @saiprasadd_511 @Josh2Gud4U But I don't think Aquaman it will be better than what we got. 1.1 billion is a lot of money. If Shazam make 500 million that's already a win."
"1499","shazam was amazing guys it didn't disappoint me!!! Aquaman is still the best but shazam might be the second best hahaha"
"1500","Shazam absolutely exceeded expectations. Kudos to the PR team for not disclosing the entire plot in the trailers. Really enjoyed this one--best DC property since Wonder Woman. (Full disclosure--I haven't seen Aquaman. I guess I'm just saying it blows Justice League and BvS away!)"
"1501","#Shazam is a dope movie. I must repeat. No problem with it. Most people already have their minds made up. #DCvsMarvel"
"1502","Whoa the Shazam movie"
"1503","You ever low-key Shazam a song while driving with someone cus u don’t want them to know their song slaps cus u don’t want it to get to their head ? Like “ok chill, 1 out of 20 bitch. Don’t make me unadd it”"

"1510","I will admit ive never read a standalone shazam before im only familiar with him from justice league (because i hardly ever branch away from batman when it comes to solo series, lmfao) but now i am.... interested"
"1511","@AdamofGotham @BrokenBridgeGXB Aquaman has been carrying some of that weight. Looks like Shazam will be, too."
"1512","Go see SHAZAM! this opening weekend! It's written by bonafide Southern genius @HenryGayden. Tennessee Williams -wishes- he could've written a movie with so much amazing buzz!"
"1513","If this is Al McCoy's last home game as the Suns announcer, and it's a big IF, it would only be appropriate that it came on the day a movie called Shazam was released."
"1514","With new movies like Shazam! and Pet Sematary out this weekend, it was easy to pick Captain Marvel (round 3). And, although it was in a smaller theatre, it was practically full. #HigherFurtherFasterBaby"
"1515","@ZacharyLevi I am turning 50 Tuesday, and my family is taking me to see @ShazamMovie this weekend for an early b-day celebration <U+0001F389>. My only request is they try to make me a #Shazam cake."
"1516","upon seeing #Shazam, I really do find it to be kinda average. it's solid, it isn't by any means terrible, but the pacing was bad at parts, and some scenes were painfully predictable. other than that though, it was a fairly fun flick and better than most movies in DC's recent past"

I am goanna be really mean here...but I can't help it cause of all the DMs I got.

I am goanna suggest we do a Shazam party tomorrow! Lets meet up at the movies"
"1523","I really dug the family aspect of the movie. #Shazam"
"1524","Shazam has some bits where it was campy but when 90% of the film is carried by kid actors (which by the way, the kid that plays Freddy is a brilliant actor) a bit of camp doesn’t hurt. 

8/10. Better than Wonder Woman was which is the last DC movie I’ve seen that I’ll acknowledge"
"1525","Need to watch Shazam before they stop showing it in IMAX <U+0001F62D>"
"1526","Shazam is one of the greatest DC movie ever made.

OK that's an exaggeration. 

But seriously it was really good."
"1527","Shazam is pretty fun. Villain is great, so is the foster family. Ending feels about a half-hour too long, and some parts are especially for-all-ages, but overall it’s a good time."
"1528","Shazam was good, goofy, fun. A movie that highlights the best aspects of the dude, and one I recommend to everyone. 

If DC ever plans on hitting the reset button, I hope they keep Zachary Levi. A bright spot in what’s otherwise a murky as Hell cinematic universe."
"1529","It’s over for ME when I see Shazam tomorrow"
"1530","@ShazamMovie Great movie.. Finally #DCEU moving in the right direction"
"1531","@ponysmasher well thanks for everything!!!!! shazam is my fav hero and you make such a good job and I am really happy! OH MY GOD I FELT SO GOOD WATCHING THE MOVIE! also @ZacharyLevi thanks for making my fav look so good on the screens!"
"1532","I wish @TheDCUniverse movies went back and actually leaned into grittiness. Sorry not sorry #Shazam"
"1533","@_taeddie @MatthewACherry @SpiderVerse Bruh. Spider verse literally only had an ethnic lead aside his two parents. Shazam was a literal melting pot of several different ethnicities. In fact the whole message was family isn’t blood. Safe to say Shazam won this one."
"1534","This movie may have passed Man of Steel as my favorite movie from the DCEU!! Loved every minute of it"
"1535","Soooo #Shazam is the BEST movie of the DC universe, hands down!"
"1536","@FeelinFilm Still haven't seen it! More hyped for John Wick 3, Shazam, John Wick 3, Avengers 4, John Wick 3, everything related to The Conjuring, and John Wick 3! And Triple Threat!"

That's all."

"1543","Oh my gosh.... Shazam.... 10/10 movie, 100% ill give no spoilers but i find some super hero movies not very entertaining but this movie on god deserves every viewer 100%"
"1544","Saw Shazam. Little slow &amp; confusing at the start, &amp; little too long, but very entertaining and funny. (I think the monsters are too scary for little kids, they scared me; monsters, not little kids) Recommend!"
"1545","@Jgrazerofficial u look like @corbynbesson  and @AsherAngel  u look like @SeaveyDaniel"
"1546","Saw Shazam tonight.  Actually really loved it."
"1547","Re-read the Shazam comic by Geoff Johns. Aside from some storytelling problems, the story isn’t well structured: It felt rushed in many parts."
"1548","We went to see Shazam and then movie hopped to see Captain Marvel and the catholic guilt has been killing me the whole time"
"1549","Guys. Streaming can seem difficult but this chart makes it easy. Look for platforms that give full value. I will be using no less than 2 devices. One I will stream /shazam from Spotify premium and the other I will watch the MV on YT. 
@BTS_twt #BTS #Persona #MAPOFTHESOUL_PERSONA"
"1550","#Shazam was fantastic and thrilling! I was really not expecting it to be so crazy with a serious element of the #UltraViolence. @ZacharyLevi did the true fans of #DC proud and anyone who likes an adventure will get it. Best superhero movie of the year : )"
"1551","@RandomMnky There was a young child beside me and let me tell you he will be having nightmares tonight! #Shazam was so intense! I loved it. Nightmares are good for your character : )"
"1552","#Shazam round 3 tomorrow"
"1553","Just saw #Shazam and I gotta say I find it funny the best DC movies are the ones you least expected to be good."
"1554","You can simply use more than 1 device for streaming, ill be using 5. For yt, spotify, anghmi, shazam (as much as possibe), and one extra. I feel like this is causing unnecessary panic now. If you only have 1 device, try balancing b/w apps. We got this as long as we are united."
"1555","@JolinTsai130 You thinking about money??
The movie was great 
Very great 
Avengers Infinity made 2 billion+ 
Batman Dark knight made 1 billion+
Guess which one is the greatest comic book movie of all time?
Many great movies didn't break box office

"1559","Have to give credit where credit is due: Shazam was actually a good movie."
"1560","@ZacharyLevi #ShazamMovie is truly a wonderful movie! My daughters loved it! My 15yr old kept talking to the characters under her breath &amp; my 12yr old asked when it would come out on disc before the final scene was even over!"
"1561","I fell in love with SHAZAM about two minutes in when it became clear that the villains were going to be the gargoyles from the TV show GARGOYLES."
"1562","There’s a point in the climax where I couldn’t believe they were doing what they were about to do and it was so great and I want to see 10 more SHAZAM movies, please and thank you."
"1563","SHAZAM rocks. What a blast. A better parody of superheroes than DEADPOOL, a better high school movie than SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, and a better foster home movie than INSTANT FAMILY, probably, I didn’t see that one."
"1564","This is easily the best DC movie since *at least* DARK KNIGHT RISES, and largely because it’s the first one that really, truly pivots from the tone that Nolan set a decade ago. With more movies like SHAZAM, DC could really build something that actually rivals Marvel."
"1565","Shazam! was a whole lot of fun and I imagine it will be pretty special to younger age groups."
"1566","Shazam was a good movie with some pretty wicked music <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"1567","So, yeah. There’s no way the Batman of #JusticeLeague has toys made of him as in #Shazam. No one even believed he existed in #BatmanvSuperman and now this guy who *brands criminals in “real life”* has a bunch of toys being sold to children? No. No.

No.”"
"1568","First of all, @ShazamMovie is amazing"
"1569","@WarnerBrosEnt finally another good DC movie since BvS. Wrong theme for superman @ponysmasher! Should have paid Cavill after screwing him and justice league over  #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. @ShazamMovie #UsetheSnyderDCThemes"

"1575","@traecrowder I just saw Shazam. Can't decide which is my 2nd fave DCEU flick because this one has good writing and plot and Aquaman has shirtless Jason Mamoa."
"1576","@ShazamMovie was so good! I’m excited to see the next @DCComics movies!"
"1577","I’m way too old to go see movies at 9pm. Also Shazam was pretty okay."

"1582","@ehmzee_ @UberKryptonian Shazam really did have a lot of checkmarks lol. He definitely didn't see it. Shame he'd act like this cuz I kinda like this guy. I think subconsciously or consciously folks have an erge to talk shit about DC movies in some way."
"1583","Shazam was good. I think the best part is where the kid hits himself in the head and my cousin yells out ""HOLY SHIT"" in the theater."
"1584","Hey, PSA that there are some scary scenes in @ShazamMovie that are not suited for kids under the age of 13. 
I just got out of seeing it and this poor little kid had to get carried out because this one scene scared her half to death. If your kid scares easily, don’t take them."
"1585","@DisneyDan @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @WarnerBrosEnt That Big Easter egg was perfect!!"
"1586","#Shazam seriously had so many surprises that really set it apart from your typical super hero movie. I really liked the general theme of family they had throughout the film, and had a great balance of serious moments with comedy. Well done DC."
"1587","The @lyft driver I got this time broke silence in the car by playing Naino Ki To Baat Naina Jane Hai by Chandra Surya &amp; Altaaf according to @Shazam. The music reminded me of the days drivers played any music they liked and freely introduced us to new music + that this is the USA!"

"1592","Yoooo Shazam was fun and that’s the movie DC shoulda made years ago. It’s got some rocky moments but what movie doesn’t. I hope it does well but I’m not sure, my showing was barely even a quarter full."
"1593","I will now be screaming ""SHAZAM!"" loudly as I run away anytime I want to exit a situation."
"1594","Shazam rly exceeded my expectations"

"1597","Well 2 out of 5 ain’t bad #SHAZAM"
"1598","Well DC 2 out of 7 ain’t bad. #SHAZAM while a little messy in terms of plot and the cgi gets usual big block buster bad. Shazam is a fun and charming flick that really shows what happens fun DC has real heart instead of “be like marvel” heart. 8 weirdly placed cameos/10."
"1599","Is it? Whoopi Goldberg and Victor Garber raised a Filipino child who marries a black girl raised by Bernadette Peters who had one black daughter and one white daughter. And we all sang along because Whitney Houston was the fairy godmother."

"1628","@greentauros If this is a joke this is the funniest shit Ever. If this is real I'm sorry that this happened to you. #Shazam"
"1629","I loved it so much"
"1630","#Shazam was surprisingly fun. By no means perfect, but it's a decent enough movie that it had me smiling most the time I was watching it. Only film in the DCEU I think is better is Wonder Woman; really hard for them to top that one..."
"1631","shazam was a really fun movie with a lot of heart"
"1632","Going to watch #SHAZAM now"
"1633","#SHAZAM was everything that I hoped it would be. Dr. Sivana was the perfect villain for this origin story. Loved the focus on the family, and @ZacharyLevi was fantastic (as expected.) Go see this movie!"
"1634","While watching #Shazam the entire crowd was fully into it. Laughing and clapping at all the appropriate moments"
"1635","@jdhmco I think aquaman and Shazam just <U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF>"
"1636","@CaresDaniella @BobDigi69 Just saw the Shazam movie I’m not sure what’s gonna happen with Superman but I hope it’s the best this movie was awesome"
"1637","pretty sure thats me"
"1638","i saw shazam and mark strong's leather coat with a fur collar and his designer sunglasses were an extremely valid choice for villain costuming"
"1639","@ZacharyLevi, I’ve been a comics fan since before I could actually read. @ShazamMovie is some of the most fun I’ve had at a theater. There are few actors I can say this about, but you were born to play this role. Well done, sir."
"1640","Holy cow! @ZacharyLevi absolutely made my week less shitty. I <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> @ShazamMovie and will definitely see it again. Maybe a twofer with @captainmarvel. #Shazam was so much fun, had a lot of heart, and just plain made me forget about the news which was sorely needed. #Thanks"
"1641","#Shazam is great but it is a sign of how badly DC/Warner Brothers rolled out the DC extended film universe that the character who is like the joke of the DC character catalog ends up having one of the best movies in it.  This, Wonder Woman, and that's it."
"1642","I’ve been a big fan of @ZacharyLevi and his work - Chuck, She Loves Me, Chuck, Tangled, Chuck, Mrs. Maisel, Chuck - and his performance in @ShazamMovie did not change that opinion! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>"
"1643","That's it guys. Wrap it up. Deactivate all of your accounts.

We've found the worst take."
"1644","AAAAAAA man I am so excited to see shazam and go bowling this weekend"
"1645","@ReelFilmFanatic @ShazamMovie @DCComics @MarvelStudios @captainmarvel I thin marvel is weighed down by the continuity and house style. Dc takes big weird swings and sometimes the reaaaly miss butnwhen they hit its incredible."
"1646","i’m so excited to see shazam i hope i can see it soon"
"1647","thanks shazam for featuring queen, tøp and niall’s songs in the movie. it was a very good watching experience"
"1648","@mudron Shazam has that same sort of Amblin/Adventures in Babysitting vibe. And agree entirely on Merlin. He’s a gem."
"1649","Just saw Shazam, Lowkey wasn’t that great. It had some good parts but overall it’s probably a 6/10 in my opinion. A little overhyped. Can’t wait for End Game though <U+0001F440>"
"1650","Wow! I just saw @ShazamMovie! It's a @DCComics sleeper hit the same way @Guardians was a sleeper hit for @MarvelStudios! 

If @ATT (who now owns DC Comics) puts out more quality films like this they will be able to challenge @DisneyStudios in the box office."
"1651","The wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the great courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. 
#SHAZAM!"
"1652","Shazam was really good. I liked the overall story and movie itself. Definitely worth seeing."
"1653","@Bookstaa That's the weird part I got tickets for shazam and now they ahev switched it with Captain Marvel"
"1654","@kingchimpgod it was exhausting. an exam and a paper due. and then work. is Shazam worth seeing?"
"1655","Ppl are offended over that one cameo in Shazam because of how it was shot <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> good grief"

"1657","@ryno1185 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie This film was shot all over Toronto, including some scenes on my street! It’s a winter scene with a park and a bunch of Christmas ornaments. It was so neat to see the set up assembled. Will probably wait for the video release, but excited regardless!"
"1658","#Shazam was SO much fun. Had a grand ol' time with the c h a d s tonight. Probably my 2nd fave dceu movie now."
"1659","@JimLee @ponysmasher The scene when Shazam and Freddy test our the powers their first night out on the town"

"1670","@Needubemyhomie @urstrulyRagghu @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel Yes it was fun and some what scary at times"
"1671","So if I was a superhero and wanted to start a superhero team....who’d join me?

Btw I watched #Shazam"
"1672","@NandovMovies As someone who lives in Toronto, just based on this film, I’m pretty sure Shazam is actually a Canadian superhero. It’s shocking how many of the real life locations I instantly knew watching the movie."
"1673","Shazam is legitimately pretty great. It's amazing to see a DC film that isn't just *grrr smash rarrrgh*"
"1674","@HellionKitty I stan the Shazam family."
"1675","I loved it, Chuck. You're a fucking delight in it."

"1677","Saw shazam last night and would like zachary levi to return my phone calls"
"1678","#Shazam was EVERYTHING and more I wanted. I've found the less I watch trailers, the more I've been enjoying it. Oh man, so much fun, actual surprises and holy crud, I LOVED Billy's family.  Hilarity, action, heroic optimism. It's golden. I want more of this DC universe. &lt;3"

"1683","Can't believe Shazam is finally in theaters, I remember when ppl were skeptical of the leaked costume pics."
"1684","For the shazaming I can spam that right like repeatedly Shazam and it will count right and not as bots?"
"1685","@PeliculasCosas I like the OG for the corny 80s movie that it is. Would you say wifey and I are better off seeing Shazam?"
"1686","Both have a very very similar end credits animation sequence"
"1687","SHAZAM being a supehero Christmas movie released more than 6 months away from December

"1688","i’m going to see shazam :)"
"1689","I’ve never really gotten into reading Shazam! but I am now definitely interested into reading more of his books. 

What an awesome movie. DC is completely on the right track and I am so ready for what’s to come!!"
"1690","There were trailers for Dark Phoenix, Endgame, and Far From Home. I got a little emotional during the FFH trailer in the realization of the time that we live in. It made me appreciate Shazam! that much more."
"1691","#Shazam was so good omg my heart is so full right now i loved every second of it i’m so happy omghshsb"
"1692","Shazam felt like an 80s movie. The performances from the cast was good and the kids especially did great. Levi as Shazam is A+ casting. It’s been a while since we got a cbm with this much heart"
"1693","Just saw @ShazamMovie just now and I love it!!"
"1694","@Midnight_Boyy Shazam isn’t that serious of a character though."

"1696","uhm HELLO????? I didn’t know dj cotrona and adam brody were in Shazam"
"1697","#Shazam is so gooooood, y’all! Loved it so much! The kid actors are AMAZING."
"1698","Most of the (admittedly very few) negative reviews for Shazam seem to bizarrely compare it to Deadpool and I’m sorry but if you think some self awareness and cheekiness makes it remotely similar in goals or result to Deadpool you’re catastrophically reading it- and movies- wrong"
"1699","Dear @Mike_Dougherty, 
I saw the exclusive 5 minute look of #GodzillaKingoftheMonsters tonight with #SHAZAM in @IMAX and I was left crying my eyes out of happiness after it was over. This is going to be the #GodzillaMovie I’ve waited my whole life for. Thank you so much!!! <U+0001F996>"
"1700","Enjoyed #ShazamMovie alot. Especially the latter half of the movie. The beginning feels more storybuilding(?). There’s definitely a bit of darkness that little ones might find a bit much. Just saying as a mom. The pay-off in this movie was so great. Worth the ticket."
"1701","@sergioees Yes ,and I felt sad when I left the theater.  Shazam is fun for everyone. It is not all fantasy  life steps to remind us of what  is important."
"1702","Just saw #Shazam kept thinking it was a buffed @jimmyfallon fighting an evil @JeffBezos for the first half of the movie."
"1703","What a night!  Topping the day off with Pizza <U+0001F355> &amp; new episodes of #KimsConvenience <U+0001F4FA>.  #Shazam tomorrow, can’t wait!  Hope everyone is having a great weekend, be safe<U+0001F44C>"
"1704","Shazam has some cool creature designs. There were multiple walkouts as parents dragged their really young kids out during one scene in particular...was surprised how grizzly one scene was."
"1705","Saw @ShazamMovie the other week with my girls at the @Fandango preview and they loved it. Very entertaining movie!"
"1706","If I trust anyone with this, it’d be you."

"1709","Indian BTSArmy tell me why did I see this as Shaktiman instead of Shazam .. I almost screamed <U+0001F602>"
"1710","@FotoCub @FotoCub That’s right and after Shazam then waiting for WW84 and Patty said awhile ago that it will be different than the first."
"1711","@TalkingDCMarvel @TalkingDCMarvel Just finished seeing Shazam and after Joker then WW84"
"1712","Shazam is the best white super hero and the first one to say the n word on the big screen #Shazam"
"1713","Watched two really good movies at the Stanford Drive In. Shazam and isn’t it Romantic a few bad parts In isn’t it Romantic but pretty good night!"
"1714","Damn just accidentally spoiled #Shazam for someone who's opinion I was really respect and anyone else who saw my tweet I feel like shit because of"
"1715","Ok. So #Shazam good. Not great. The begining is slow, but alright, the antics with Shazam are funny, but I enjoyed it a lot less than I thought I would. The last act is good, but a little sloppy in some places. And the CGI sucks balls."
"1716","Ok. On further thought, #Shazam is more of a 7/10. Again, good. Not great."
"1717","watch #Shazam this weekend to keep the mutual"
"1718","@Vileself It kinda did blow away captain marvel even shazam ain't better then the other DC movies except suicide squad."
"1719","@Vileself Aquaman was wayyyy better then shazam its no comparison lol, I'll rate it below wonder woman and  bvs. The third act kinda fell apart they didn't need to introduce ""those characters "" that soon."
"1720","Half of these superhero movies I don’t give a shit for nor have I seen, But Shazam and Captain Marvel seem promising"
"1721","Half of these superheroe movies I don’t give a shit for nor have I seen, But Shazam and Captain Marvel seem promising"
"1722","Good thing Freddy knows his stuff. See #SHAZAM now playing in theaters."
"1723","<U+0001F447><U+0001F3FD>Totally true!! Also the use of Queen-Don’t Stop Me Now, was brilliant and one of the best montages in CBM ever!!"
"1724","My scepticism of Shazam was shocked into obliteration; what a fun movie!"
"1725","Havent smiled like that in a while. Thanks #Shazam #theoriginalcaptainmarvel"
"1726","Enjoyed Shazam.  As an old Captain Marvel head lived the suprises from @ponysmasher .  Great job."
"1727","This honestly makes so happy especially for the message that the movie left you about family"
"1728","Someone that thought Wonder Woman was a great movie just said that Shazam is on the same level. Does that mean I should be scared it's a terrible movie?"
"1729","@fincherism @Josh2Gud4U I *just* said this in a Shazam review podcast tonight. I'll link ya when it goes live. 

So good!"
"1730","wow i LOVED shazam that was the wholesome content i needed in my life oh my GOD"
"1731","I have been editing my #Shazam movie review video today, and have been having issues with my computer, it has just been a little slow of late. However, I seem to have gotten the issue all squared away and my video will be up within the next 20 minutes!"
"1732","Just finished watching Shazam and all I got say to say is that this is truly a major step forward for DC. 

Funny, fantastic fight sequences, and their jabs at other movies made it for me. Definitely worth watching again! 9/10 

Also that ending scene! #Shazam"
"1733","Just finished watching Shazam. 

This movie is definitely a step forward for DC and it’s future doesn’t look uncertain as it was before.

Also that ending scene! The whole theater went nuts! #Shazam"
"1734","@MyNameIsGaron @ShazamMovie @TheDCUniverse I really want to see it. Okay to take an 8 year old?"
"1735","If a few scenes in Shazam were changed, it would be the best DC movie.

It is by far the one with the best acting in it. Zachary Levi is brilliant, all the Child actors are amazing, and not even in a ""for a child actor"" way."
"1736","I really need to see Shazam again, it was such a great fun movie!!! #Shazam"
"1737","Shazam the greatest DC so far"
"1738","Shazam is the greatest DC movie so far.  DC needs to keep this up."
"1739","@cardigirlies @666cardi @widestan @PopAlarms @iamcardib A true one. You hear some new artist on the radio, you get interested to know more about her and her music, so you shazam the song and later on find more music from her and then you end up buying it. That’s how it works. And if u really can’t see that... then sorry for u"
"1740","an endgame trailer played before shazam and i almost cried"
"1741","This is how you promote a movie for everyone!

Take notes, @Marvel. #LeaveYourPersonalPoliticsAtHome"
"1742","Shazam definitely one of the best DC films wow <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

"1744","#Shazam is absolutely brilliant! <U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1> it came to mess with my top 5! that's crazy! <U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728>"
"1745","So yeah. I really fucking loved Shazam! It's a fucking Christmas movie which is great! It's fun as hell which is rad! It had a stop motion ED and SUPPORTIVE PARENTS!!!  8/10 SEE IT NOW!!!!!"
"1746","This is 100000% spot on"
"1747","Shazam! just might be the best DC movie made yet"
"1748","@MissGandaKris @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Oh my god this is incredible."
"1749",".@ShazamMovie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I really love it!!! The actors are great, and the comedic timing is perfect as well as the script. Kudos to everyone involved in this movie! #ShazamMovie"
"1750","Glad I went into #Shazam with lowered expectations. It was way overhyped. It was okay. My kids loved it, but it wasn’t really for me. It’s a lot cheesier than I would’ve liked. It fits into the tone they set Justice League which was a downer for me unfortunately."
"1751","the soundtrack for Shazam....Queen, twenty one pilots, Eminem....really outdid themselves with this one (plus the movie was really good too) #Shazam"
"1752","@AquamAnder 1. Shazam
2. Aquaman
3. Wonder Woman
4. Man of Steel
5. BvS
6. JL
7. I ddnt know there was a 7th movie?"
"1753","I really wanted to like #Shazam. I love everyone in it! It was fine. Fairly good even. I think I give up on DC. I keep trying to like their stuff and then just...not."
"1754","Shazam reminded me of the goonies and it made me go :)"
"1755","Just saw @ShazamMovie and oh just god, it was so good.

I loved everything about it.

I so wish they could call him Captain Marvel, but whatever."
"1756","Off to see #shazam. Super psyched about this <U+0001F929>"
"1757","Saw Shazam! tonight. Not normally a big fan of super hero movies, but this one was a lot of fun!"
"1758","@RandyS0725 It feels with Aquaman and Shazam a good balance has been struck.

Not that the dark and gritty DCEU wasn't great to see. Long term no one wants depression after watching a superhero film"
"1759","Yo, Shazam is the most fun superhero movie I've seen in a while. Total blast!"
"1760","I just want to let @ZacharyLevi know that when Shazam left the convenience store my theater broke and you just went all Sans Undertale laugh for a solid minute and it broke me for the rest of the runtime"
"1761","I wanna thank the makers of #Shazam for adding Sans Undertale to the movie"
"1762","@thegeeksidekick ||•Just throwing this out there but my character is actually part of Shazam!'s stories in the comics."
"1763","@TheMikeymikeXO Lmao oh in that case go with Shazam. She'll like that"
"1764","Aquaman and Shazam are actually giving me faith in DC films again since The Dark Knight Trilogy, Shazam was great #Shazam"
"1765","Shazam is one of the most fun movies I’ve seen in a while, it was all around just a pretty good movie 7.6/10

My only big problem is they made him floss

And Logan ignored me"
"1766","Adam Brody likes my tweet so I never really have bad days now. Tomorrow #Shazam happening #Confirmed."
"1767","Just got out of Shazam. So glad one of my favorite DC super heroes has a movie this good and fun. Kids were running around yelling ""Shazam!"" while chasing each other. Shazam is finally here to stay."
"1768","Thinking about how Netherrealm screwed up portraying both Wonder Woman and Shazam, the two DC characters with the really good movies that everyone likes."
"1769","Very excited about #Shazam .. good reviews coming in.."
"1770","I think I accidentally guilt tripped my dad into taking me to go see Shazam  jdjjs not what I was intending but whatvr gay rights"
"1771","Shazam was such a cute movie. Comic books are made for kids and that’s what this movie reminded me of. Good stuff"
"1772","Shazam ending with jack being surprised by superman was the funniest ending in a movie i have ever seen in my entire life"
"1773","While I’m waiting for Shazam to start, lemme just say I’m gonna riot if there’s no mention of an extended Marvel family. Or Tawny."
"1774","just watched Shazam, it’s easily the best thing the DCEU has ever produced. I loved it.<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"1775","@JimLee @ponysmasher I wept when Billy leaps off the building and yells Shazam with all the confidence and heart in him to go and save his family."
"1776","Yo so #Shazam is actually readily good. Dc has been killin it lately"
"1777","Also in Shazam legend played ?? I was not expecting that I thought it was about tylers grandpa ?"
"1778","So @ShazamMovie was sooooo good. Highly recommend it. Oh and Meagan Good is still fine af."
"1779","Man DC finally got good writers on thier team because they are coming with the heat Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and shazam were so good. Finally doing my DC superheros right lol"
"1780","Had a series of literal Laughing Out Loud moments during #SHAZAM
@ZacharyLevi nailed it."
"1781","so shazam was really THAT good and i want to talk about it so RT this to be in a gc :)
- like shazam

- i'll add like 15-20 people"
"1782","@JimLee @ponysmasher Mary, Freddy and the rest saying Shazam"
"1783","I really dug #Shazam. I laughed, I cried. Loved that Sandberg still was able to sprinkle in touches of horror with Big &amp; even Goonies. Was really touched by Billy and the foster family. I had an awesome time.  #saytheword"
"1784","Man #SHAZAM is even better a second time. 

Despite its obvious meh CGI due to its low budget, this is still amazing.

It’s no secret Aquaman has the best CGI in the DCEU, but I think Shazam is the best solo DCEU film rn imo

They captured what Shazam is all about &amp; great set up"
"1785","Got out of Shazam and there are a bunch of kids jumping off steps screaming SHAZAM so yeah I think this movie is going to do well"
"1786","@Cam_Carney45 Should have went to see Shazam. 10/10"

"1791","@ShazamMovie The “Big” reference made my night! 

Thanks for laughs!!"
"1792","@Somecallmejon They’ve already sort of hit the reset button already with Aquaman. These movies are gonna be standalone until further notice, with vague references. Just focusing on being good, entertaining, and having fun. I loved Shazam."
"1793","Shazam was GREAT! Probably my favorite DC film in a very long time. I had so much fun watching this. Major props to @ponysmasher and the marketing team for keeping so much of this movie a secret! There were so many surprises that blew my mind. I can’t wait for a sequel! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"1794","@Animated_Antic This with Shazam. They played the Dora trailer and the audience was groaning, looking at their phones, and laughing at it. I was like, OH GOD WHY."
"1795","Just saw @ShazamMovie and was pleasantly surprised to hear Slow Hands by @NiallOfficial in it.   #Shazam"
"1796","Yeah like whatever Shazam sucks.People who believe it’s better than aquaman, wonder woman just lost their minds."
"1797","Sorry dc &amp; warnerbross but shazam is such a boring movie. I feel the hype whenever Billy turn into shazam but other than that it feels soo boriiing, i almost felt a sleep. Aquaman still better."
"1798","Shazam plays Queen and then twenty one pilots right after. This is my dream."
"1799","My professional job is now “yelling about Shazam for the 3 weeks before it gets buried my Endgame”"
"1800","okay i really need to go to sleep, goodnight and go see shazam!!"

"1803","#Shazam was a damn good time. I'm really surprised by how good it turned out to be."
"1804","There are superhero roles where you can't see anyone else playing the character.

Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man
Hugh Jackman as Wolverine

Jackie Earl Haley as Roarshach

and now Zachary Levi as #Shazam"
"1805","#Shazam is really... such a fucking fantastic film. so much heart."

"1812","#Shazam was awesome, my just be better than Aquaman.  I only had 1 major issue but once you overlook that the movie is near perfect."
"1813","Amazingly a great Aquaman and a great Shazam movie.  Now all I need is great movies about Hawkman, Nightwing, Swamp Thing, and the Question and I'll have all my favorite characters done."

but this looks promising"

but this looks different"
"1827","The guy in Shazam! is so fucking hot god damn <U+0001F924>"
"1828","@Nethilez @FC_Violent @TheAshenLuca Not necessarily. 
Justice league would be considered more MCU-ish because of the crappy 1liners and campy humor. It doesnt fit the tone or setting.

It does in shazam. There is a difference"
"1829","Fun fact: Djimon Hounsou is in both Captain Marvel movies. The one that came out last month and #Shazam . Props to his management for pulling that off."

"1835","Hey @ZacharyLevi , I am so excited to see #Shazam tomorrow. Please consider coming to Chicago's Heroes and Villains Fan Fest April 20th. I know a lot of fans would like to meet you."
"1836","I heard Shazam was actually a good movie despite the corny ass movie trailers."
"1837","I will put my baby dick in you, I will scream Shazam: your pussy is now destroyed; I have turned into Shazam."
"1838","@4eyedRaven Now even the ones that are supposed to be connected are focused on building their own worlds. Aquaman which birthed the trench and Shazam which pretty much is its own world. I hope The Batman would summon a bunch of movies within its own w/ batfamily and villains."
"1839","If they're planning to make #Shazam sequel then they have to move immediately cause those kids are growing too fast!lol"
"1840","I really love Shazam. A personal side about my family, my siblings were sent into foster care some years after my dad died and I had to fight to get them back in court when I was just 19. Seeing foster kids as main characters made me happy especially cuz I saw it with my brother!"
"1841","The OG captain marvel just made my day! @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi y’all made me freak out and laugh till I cried! #shazam! @TheRock you got competition #BlackAdam"

"1844","Just saw Shazam!, and the prescience of the film was what I thought. Awesome!!!! If the DCU plays it's cards right they have a lot of interesting comic characters. Mister miracle, hawkman, legion of doom and so on...... #Shazam was awesome!!! #TEAMDCU"
"1845","@FilmMeUpReview @EdsFilmicForays @Live_for_Films @nerdschatting @JackGeekstalk I'm quite excited for the future releases Dark Phoenix and Hobbs and Shaw. And my next watchlist is as follows:

"1855","I saw Shazam today and it was hilarious and really fun to watch. I liked that the film never took itself too seriously and while it’s not a cinematic masterpiece it’s probably my fav DCU film to-date"

"1865","#ShazamMovie was extremely delightful and hilarious it’s the DC comic book movie the others can learn from"
"1866","The film Shazam was great. Great humor, decent effects, great moral and a nice Christmas movie in April. I'll say if you like late 80's movies like Big, ET or Gremlins, it's worth watching. 8.5/10. @ComicPerch @staredcraft @DollaBinReviews @GrandComicsGC @marsanj47 @denisecp87"
"1867","@AADowd Did #SHAZAM put you to sleep like it did to me?  I was surprised @vishnevetsky wasn’t more critical of the blatant superhero trope peppered throughout the entire slog of a film. C- at best."
"1868","It EXCEEDS the hype!  Refreshingly witty and downright amazing."
"1869","The actors were truly amazing!  All of them!  A real treat to see “Jerry “ from TWD."
"1870","A big SHOUT OUT for SHAZAM!  Great movie!  Hilarious!  A real “feel good” movie for adults and kids.   It was action packed, well written, the actors were fabulous and I laughed harder than I have in a very long time.  SEE THIS MOVIE!"
"1871","I will see this movie again and again!"
"1872","Surprisingly GREAT movie!!!"
"1873","I’m giving this a 9.99"
"1874","This is a must see for adults and children."
"1875","@Rfene @ShazamMovie @NiallOfficial Cool I didn't know it was in the movie."
"1876","This movie had so much heart and action !!  I can’t say enough good things about it. GO WATCH IT!!"
"1877","So I’m at a bar right now and there’s this rock song.. that’s has the same exact part in the Honda-san opening LOL. I wonder if the Honda-san opening sampled from this.
Too bad I didn’t Shazam the song in time"
"1878","After 7 DCEU entries, I can’t fault anyone for saying #Shazam is the ‘best’ of the bunch. Is there a definitive bar set? If so, feel free to place it between Aquaman &amp; WW, imo. Tonal shifts are a bit manic. Comedic moments hit the mark. It’s scarier than Annabelle &amp; Lights Out!"
"1879","2. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam. He really was able to embody an inner child inside an adult body. He is definitely the best part in the film. For Mark Strong, I think he tried, but the material given to him didn’t allow him to reach new heights. He was a weak villain."
"1880","@UkiyaSeed @comiXology @JerryOrdway The first was (as the cover states) around the same time as the ""Legends"" mini-series. It sought to take advantage of Shazam's involvement in it to reintroduce him to a new generation. I loved that series myself."
"1881","BIG HEADS UP

Shazam is way to violent for those under 12"
"1882","@JerryOrdway @UkiyaSeed @comiXology I loved what you did with the Power of Shazam, but I definitely think that you should have changed more things..."
"1883","SHAZAM IS GREAT!!!!! Hilarious and a great plot for the character. Great comic book lore also done VERY WELL. Can't wait to see more of him in the universe. Another great superhero origin story. @DRMovieNews1"
"1884","Finally on my way to see #SHAZAM"
"1885","Shazam is easily the best movie I’ve seen since Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"

"1891","First Aquaman and now #Shazam DC is finally building a solid run. Love it! SHAZAM!!!"
"1892","@BobDigi69 Actually he is also involved in SHAZAM production...as a PRODUCER if i’m not wrong."
"1893","Besides Shazam as I still have yet to see it, this is pretty much how I'd rank the DCEU as well."
"1894","SHAZAM! has the earnest heart of THE ROCKETEER transplanted to modern-day Philadelphia. Loved it"
"1895","@reesealghul pls remove ur energy from my whole scene this is a tweet only for Shazam if you brought nothing to the potluck exuente stage right"
"1896","since apparently ass fam is all MCU stans now  who wants to come talk to me abt Shazam and how neat Zac Levi is"
"1897","it was fun and funny and lbr i have never read even one Shazam comic but it was so good!!!! i had a blast!!!! AND I LOVE MY BOY ZACH!!!!"
"1898","@n1ckfamous The rights for the name are quite complicated issue. In the 70's when they lost the copyright, there was a technicality. He could be called Captain Marvel inside the book but the title had to be Shazam. That led up to the New 52 where they full on changed it to Shazam."
"1899","I wonder how the OG Captain Marvel purists thought of Shazam. Knowing they hate the New 52 version of the character and that they were pretty much boycotting the movie since the first images, I wonder if they gave it a chance or are just judging it by its cover."
"1900","The bullies in #Shazam have replaced Barb as my new fave gay icons."
"1901","@TheVideoGamHer That movie was great. @DCComics is on a roll. First Aquaman and now Shazam. Hope they keep this up."
"1902","So there is a scene in the movie Shazam where the Superhero (Shazam) witnesses domestic violence take place and says/does nothing <U+0001F610><U+0001F610><U+0001F610> #Shazam"
"1903","I thought Shazam was the lamest superhero but after seeing the new movie he tops all my favorite DC superhero’s...which is none"
"1904","I want to watch shazam but no one I know wants to come with"
"1905","#SHAZAM was a great movie. Definitely go see it. CGI is super bad but on a budget of 80m it wasn’t that bad."
"1906","SHAZAM! Easily top 5 movies for me"
"1907","Update, not going to see Shazam tomorrow"
"1908","The only reason why Shazam says to the World he’s Captain Marvel is because he can’t say the word SHAZAM without transforming back to Billy Batson which will give away his identity. Which is why he is Captain Marvel."
"1909","@DeputyARUUU @ShazamMovie WB Japan f**ked up. They decided to release this movie around the same time as End Game, like, what??? Do they want the movie to flop in Japan?"
"1910","@jeremyboss007 switch BvS and JL and this would be my list(I also haven't seen Shazam yet though, probably see it tomorrow)"
"1911","Its official!!
#Shazam is a hit!!"
"1912","#Shazam is a great f***ing Awesome movie! It's Dark AND Light @ the same time!"
"1913","@sakamoto_joe2 My Friends saw Shazam tonight and they said it was very funny and Better then Aquaman Have an Awesome one Bro Goodnight"
"1914","SHAZAM IS FUCKING FANTATIC!  Between this and Aquaman, DC is really catching up to Marvel in the best of ways!  STRONG recommendation!"
"1915","This the second time I've seen something like this tonight"
"1916","shazam snapped with this point and they absolutely had the right too"

"1921","#SHAZAM is a fun movie. At times there are too many jokes but the love that the movie gives in its message is simply beautiful. 
This movies helps you remember to be thankful for having people that love you."
"1922","#Shazam is movie with a beautiful message about family that’s worth having. 
And the epic references to DC in general are simply the best."
"1923","@husseiniif Literally never heard of Shazam"
"1924","@ZacharyLevi just went and watched #Shazam and was blown away. As a fan from the Chuck days you blow this part out the box."
"1925","Just watched #Shazam and it was fuckin lit!!!

I felt a great connection with Freddy for whatever reason

Dude had some amazing zingers and one-liners!!"
"1926","I still have to see it but the promotion I saw wasn’t really diverse. From the image it looks like the usual white lead(s) surrounded by non white people ala Spider-Man homecoming, Jurassic World, Captain Marvel etc.."
"1927","I still have to see it but the promotion wasn’t really diverse. From the image it looks like usual white lead(s) surrounded by non white people ala Spider-Man homecoming, Jurassic World, Captain Marvel etc.."
"1928","We're to this point where we are beginning to accept child actors as an equal to the adults. Shows like Stranger Things crush stereotypes that anyone famous ranging from age nine to I guess eighteen or nineteen to not act their age; are a pain in the ass of witnessing onscreen."
"1929","#ShazamMovie while undeniably cheesy is something that the superhero movie fan base needs in light of the recent gritty &amp; dark releases. The movie never asks you to take it seriously so just kick back and stuff your face with some popcorn.

#DCUniverse on the rise?: 7/10"
"1930","I just watched Shazam at the movies, I practically loved the movie. Super inspired by the new 52's HQ. You were perfect. I certainly screamed lot of emotion.

"1940","'I am a Foster mom, what's your superpower'
#Shazam
Incredible movie.."
"1941","This is pretty much how I feel too about a couple of those ""Oh, that got a bit darker than I expected"" moments in Shazam. Not for every kid, sure, but for a kid like I was a kid."
"1942","I finally saw the shazam trailer. looks fun, a nice change from the dcu so far.  though it got me thinking about other heroes. like Starman. there are only two that i think will work. Thom from the future, or the David Bowie one. maybe Mikkel to have a gay superhero on screen."
"1943","Go Support #Shazam if you're thinking about watching it! Even tho I personally will be holding out for Endgame, I don't wanna see this movie fail though"
"1944","So Shazam only made $5.9 million in the Thursday night box office.. Yikes! I know it's only thursday and isn't a Friday or the weekend, but those number are pretty horrible. hopefully the movie does well, but i'm sure most ppl are holding out for Avengers Endgame, same with me"
"1945","Also, can't the Captain Marvel haters support Shazam more?? Lol they spent their time hating on Cap Marvel so much it made over a billion dollars.. now they won't support the movie they've been praising?? smh that's how u know they're full of shit"
"1946","@MrZMovies Fantastic Four is a joke. Captain America  Winter Soldier is easily one of the top five super hero movies of all time, a literal game changer. Unbreakable, it is probable too new but Shazam! Is legit fantastic and is really at it’s heart is what the magic of comic books is about."
"1947","I might take myself to go see Shazam. I was fake waiting for it to come out."
"1948","So. The Idaho SHAZAM was quite good at what it set out to be. Not remotely the Fawcett Captain Marvel,  but still, a good movie about the Geoff Johns Shazam.

I’ve got a couple of quibbles, but it’s a lot of fun and I think it’s going to do very well."
"1949","@lemonjot @YahooEnt Spider verse just got one non-white character, #Shazam got about 10, please watch it for proof"

"1953","We need more good horror films. 

Watching Shazam and the trailers for upcoming films of other genres were so fucking trash

Like that one film with Rebel Wilson (I think that’s her name but who cares) who’s just as funny as Amy Schumer 

GIMME HORROR FILMS"
"1954","It’s already set up but I am confident it won’t be for Shazam sequel"
"1955","Shout-out to @ShazamMovie for finally being an enjoyable DC film from start to finish!"
"1956","Shazam is a solid Christmas movie and my only problem with it is that it inaccurately depicts the interior of SEPTA trains and stations. They're generally not quite so clean."
"1957","Shazam was really good I’d recommend it, surprisingly my favorite dc superhero movie so far ~"
"1958","#Shazam is pure fun! If superhero movies ended now, I would be satisfied. Thanks to all involved in making this. @ponysmasher @geoffjohns"

"1962","@TheFliteCast 1/2  I’m not knocking if you enjoy it.  But for me personally- I liked it but didn’t love it.  I never had that moment with the score thinking “That’s the definitive theme for Shazam”.   Aside from that minor nitpick- I really love the movie; it ranks alongside Aquaman for me."
"1963","@TheFliteCast 2/2  While I didn’t feel the urge afterwards to see Aquaman again theatrically- I cannot wait to see Shazam again.   [Without spoilers] it’s absolutely a movie to see with an audience- to both experience the film with them and share their experience with the film in the theater."
"1964","shazam is a delight, the dcu is really killing it lately"
"1965","SHAZAM was cheesy, the costumes were silly, and the plot was simple...

It's the best DCEU movie"
"1966","Shazam! Was way better than expected. And if for nothing else, I appreciate it for the Freddie Freeman reference"
"1967","Also, Shazam kicked ass. There's some possibly slightly triggering bits at the beginning with the family and a car accident. Other than that, it's super good.
<U+0001F31F>"
"1968","shazam ended all other superhero movies, proved the dceu's excellence and superiority so you all best go watch it"

"1973","@reel_geek Well considering I had an extensive collection of 70s and 80s and 90s comics, I never enjoyed DC except for a select few. I was always Marvel. I did enjoy my share of Jimmy Olsen stories though. I’d rather watch a Jimmy Olsen movie then Shazam"
"1974","@reel_geek I will be completely ok living my life without ever seeing Shazam. Also, I coulda done without Aquaman."
"1975","@ShazamMovie could have been called Captain Marvel.  It’s would be fantastic! What an awesome movie! Great work @ZacharyLevi"
"1976","so in shazam there’s this one scene where freddy says, “name one cool sidekick!” and no one replies in the movie and i found it really amazing how both times i saw it, everyone in the theatre yelled, “Robin!” and it makes my heart so warm"
"1977","might fuck around and see shazam tomorrow just for a possible FFH trailer beforehand"
"1978","@arstechnica Aquaman was surprisingly decent. And Shazam looks really promising.

It's good to see high quality cinema from the DC verse. The Marvel franchise is starting feel a bit stale. Hope they can close endgame on a high"
"1979","I CANNOT agree with this thread more. It's something Jim Henson knew in his bones: sometimes it's *good* for kids to get scared."
"1980","@Shazam tracks the song faster, @SoundHound displays precise lyrics on time."
"1981","I honestly didn't have the highest hopes for Shazam mostly because I'm not the biggest fan of most DC movies but it was very well done.
I had a lot of fun and I think everyone will enjoy it."
"1982","I watched Shazam! today and I gotta say, what a really good movie!
I'm not muh of a DC fan, but I rally enjoyed this one."

Wasn’t ‘Shazam’ established well before that game?"

I won't spoil it, but there's the smallest moment with Shazam comforting someone during a big throw-down action scene. The moment after it happened I uttered out-loud ""Bad ass."""

"2164","@Crawford_MILB ... relationship between Billy and Freddie was well done and they had a lot of funny moments. Mark Strong was a compelling villain and for those of us who know the Shazam character and the lore, I thought there was just enough to satisfy us and world build."

"2172","@Steele131 Its naturally delivered by the characters. There is no reliance on quips or one liners. #CaptainMarvel  failed terribly. It was so cringe hearing Brie Larson force a quip.

"2176","About to watch Shazam and there’s a pack of ten-year-olds sitting behind me not-so-quietly roasting various adults in the theater and frankly this feels like the right way to experience this film."
"2177","The last scene of Shazam was pretty dope though"
"2178","For me #Shazam is the best movie that DC ever produced!!! I mean for real its freaking hilarious! Definitely must watch!"
"2179","@Superman0621 Henry should have made a fan service by not demanding a raise for the Shazam cameo...Maybe he doenst love the character as we think he does..."
"2180","Finally get a chance to watch Shazam lol"
"2181","Shazam was pretty good, DC is getting into a good rhythm with their movies"
"2182","Must see movie!! Loved every minute of it.! SHAZAM!!<U+0001F329><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"2183","Endgame probably won't top Shazam. Lbr. (Though I may be surprised.)

Sorry guys, I just really loved Shazam."
"2184","@ZacharyLevi is it too early to campaign for Yvonne Strahovski as Isis in the sequel? #Shazam #ShazamMovie #ChuckReunion #NerdHQ"
"2185","i went to see shazam despite having no idea what it was about and actually had a fun time"
"2186","Released today just for me on my birthday #shazam was way better than expected!! Def one of my fave DC movies! #movies #dcmovies #dccomics #dcmovies #mortalkombatvsdcuniverse"
"2187","I saw Shazam! It was pretty good. The ending really won me over. Mark Strong makes a great villain as always."
"2188","Shazam is a perfect movie. Go watch it now!!!"
"2189","Just saw #Shazam and it’s the best recent DC movie so far"
"2190","Saw Shazam. It was cute, I liked it. Zachary Levi was most of the appeal."
"2191","None of you told me that Adam Brody, our generation's greatest actor, is in SHAZAM!"
"2192","@MissAdunola_ @PrattFalls So right!  Especially at the top levels of our Government. Take her to Shazam!  There is a character she will identify with."
"2193","Shazam: It's entertaining, but it's worrying that the 1st film of the re-directed DCEU is this superficial, derivative, and pandering. B-"
"2194","I’m getting killed in the comments. Y’all shazam stans better leave me alone lol"
"2195","That there isn't a regular @DocShaner - illustrated SHAZAM! book is further proof that we are in the grim meathook dystopia-verse and not the we-are-destined-to-be-elevated-starchildren universe."
"2196","Shazam! was so good! Omg (even though at least two things were off) 10/10 highly recommend. <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"2197","bro everyone needs to watch shazam it’s my new favorite christmas movie"
"2198","I’m not against it, but Shazam has never looked GOOD to me.  So the fact that everyone keeps saying how great it is?  Strange."
"2199","On the very short list of good DC movies, Shazam is towards the top"
"2200","how could it be diverse when it didn't have a whole press tour pointing it out??? <U+0001F61C><U+0001F61C>"
"2201","Went to go see #ShazamMovie tonight. Was not disappointed."
"2202","pay me money or I’ll leak the videos I took of shazam"
"2203","Shazam is such a great DC film! I love it!!"
"2204","@SuperSuitShow @staredcraft @UpToTASK @ChecKtheCircuiT @artbyatlas0 @MTFIII @MrNiceGuy18_58 @In_Cli_Nation @Burn0321 @BThanBTI @3BlackGeeks @ShazamMovie Saw it today right after work.  Feels good to finally say the DCEU has a great movie."
"2205","-&gt;(SHAZAM SPOILERS) There’s already a million superhero films where the main villain is the opposite of the hero. I want a superhero film where the main villain is an evil caterpillar."
"2206","@mG7VJxZNCI I saw shazam today and it reminds me of the codes he saw <U+0001F60A><U+0001F643>"
"2207","my sole purpose in life is to love ""comedy-relief"" supers so that edgy nazis don't get ahold of them  anyway i'm adopting shazam"
"2208","Watched #Shazam yesterday and I loved it, the plot acting action and humour were all great DC is finally moving in the right direction"
"2209","I will straight  say this, the movie was the perfect speed of serious and funny. The movie did what it need to do, and did it very well. It was not made from some 50 year old fan, this was made for this generations folks to have something to look up to like these 50 year olds did"
"2210","Thinking about how Shazam balanced being dark and funny so well"
"2211",".@ZacharyLevi .@smugorange Just got out of #Shazam and it was awesome!!! See you at WSC Cooper and Zachery, hope to see you at SDCC!"
"2212","Just got back from watching #ShazamMovie , omg it was such a lovely and funny film."
"2213","Omg I just saw Shazam and that was the most FUN I’ve had watching a super hero movie in AGES! I was really happy with the diversity too. You should definitely go see it :) #ShazamMovie"
"2214","no balls y’all Shazam is my Top 3 fave superhero movies it was SO GOOD"
"2215","8.5/10 really great I’ve got to see it again sometime #SHAZAM"
"2216","Just saw @ShazamMovie and sinmany thoughts... but FUCK, #NoSpoilers, how much cooler if they got that person in this movie?!?!"
"2217","Was Invited to the Grand Opening of the first @SonyDigitalTheatre in Las Vegas. Hung out with a few buds! Never felt so safe! #Shazam #Superman #WonderWoman #Flash and #Batman. Aquaman was apparently Sea Sick?"
"2218","@loRenze89 @saiprasadd_511 @Josh2Gud4U Switch Aquaman for Shazam"
"2219","@KurtBusiek Oh OK not that it was the Idaho-flavored Shazam. Which would probably be potato-flavored."
"2220","Wow #shazam #ShazamMovie was underwhelming. Saw a double feature with #CaptainMarvel and no comparison. Cap Marvel all the way."
"2221","shazam was honestly one of the better superhero movies out there, you should definitely watch it."
"2222","Shazam! was super fun. Never expected to enjoy a movie about Shazam so much."
"2223","Shazam was good but definitely because of the last 25 minutes"
"2224","Is @ZacharyLevi going to do for #DCEU what @RobertDowneyJr did for #MCU? #ShazamMovie reviews seem to be pointing in that direction..."
"2225","DC finally brings in the humor! Great scripting. The acting amongst the extras and some foster kids could be better when it involves computer animation. But overall, you can keep my money. Loved the movie. And thanks for not bringing in politics. <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F> #Shazam"
"2226","Endgame who? I'll be seeing Shazam 10 more times thanks"
"2227","Shazam is the best DC film since Dark Knight. With ease. Super fun. Lots of heart. Good score. GREAT KID ACTING. 10/10"
"2228","Shazam is the best movie in the DC Universe, thus far."
"2229","This is so CUTE. I’m even more excited for Sunday now,,,,,"
"2230","The found family trope is my favorite thing and #Shazam feed me so well"
"2231","Shazam! was so good I love all the kids DC is thriving lately and that fuels me"
"2232","Ok but Shazam was actually really good. I was very surprised. I totally forgot it was a DC movie"
"2233","Okay, wow. @ShazamMovie is probably my favorite superhero movie ever. The @DCComics universe really came for @Marvel like that. 1) @ZacharyLevi <U+0001F60D><U+2665><U+FE0F> 2) #SethCohen and 3) I laughed so hard. #MCU gotta step it up."
"2234","Shazam(!) was pretty awesome. I have a soft spot for stand-alone superhero movies."
"2235","@py_bun There are many things wrong with this. Shazam’s cool though"
"2236","People realize that Marvel isn’t the only studio that does end credit scenes right? Cause there are two scenes after Shazam and half the theater left before each one."
"2237","Also go freaking watch Shazam. Easily one of my favorite superhero movies ever. Also Don’t Stop Me Now plays during a montage and that’s just fantastic."
"2238","Really cool to see @1moreGaryFrank's name on the credits of #Shazam 
 
<U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"2239","Sooooo Shazam is the feel good movie of the year while pet semetary is the most fucked up film in the past decade. My life is balanced"
"2240","@JimLee @ponysmasher Shazam family reveal for sure!"
"2241","Lmao Superman is in Shazam but it isn't even Henry Cavill you're crumbling away DC"
"2242","So glad to finally have #gamer representation in a film! #ShazamMovie #shazam"
"2243","Wanted to have a superhero movie on in the background to set the stage for SHAZAM tomorrow. Saving the Marvel movies for another week or so and it doesn't feel like a DARK KNIGHT kind of night, so I have put on... #JusticeLeague"
"2244","Y’all! Shazam was better than expected!! Great job @ZacharyLevi! Easily in my top 3 current #DCCinematicUniverse! #ShazamMovie #DCUNIVERSE #dc"
"2245","I loved #Shazam ready to see it again."
"2246","Wow, in the 10:15 pm showing for Shazam! And it’s empty! <U+0001F61F>"
"2247","Absolutely loved Shazam! to the point of tears. A large part of it is tied to my personal journey as a foster parent and the difficult feelings I know these kids are forced to deal with at a young age. Probably going to watch it every Christmas and cry all over again."
"2248","Shazam was so good, definitely the best DC film in a while. So that was cool, what's not cool is having to work at 8am tomorrow so<U+270C><U+0001F3FC>"
"2249","I was skeptical at first but @ShazamMovie was actually pretty good <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>"
"2250","#Shazam is just as fun the second time. I actually caught some lines I missed the first time from laughing so hard.  Seriously such a fun and funny movie. Another win for DC."
"2251","Just got out of #Shazam . A good ride and definitely had it’s dark moments for a different DCEU film.

Great soundtrack and great performances by everyone."
"2252","If somebody ask me about my favorite part about Shazam movie, I will obviously answer that the two seconds part when slow hands came out @NiallOfficial"
"2253","@dailyspiidey And Shazam is flopping most overseas market..<U+0001F644>"
"2254","@stringofcharact @the_snarkmaster @dailyspiidey Dc fans did much worse before captain marvel release.. Now it looks like shazam entire box office will b lower than CM's opening weekend. FLOp"
"2255","@kirkneverdied Under lmao...people in the comments clearly aren't following box office numbers. 4-4.5 million Thursday night, Into the Spider-Verse made 3.5 and debuted under $40 million. Shazam won't go over $50, flopping overseas too"
"2256","One of the best parts of Shazam was seeing Seth Cohen is alive and well!"
"2257","@ZacharyLevi and team's #Shazam was the best superhero movie since Dark  Knight! #AmazingJob #Chuck fans will love it!"
"2258","“There's such a disconnect between how cheerful Zachary Levi is as Shazam and Billy Batson being a such a negative loner”

that’s how it is new 52 actually. they made billy a sad angry kid lol"
"2259","Might go more in depth on a Shazam! review, maybe. Idk"
"2260","Shazam has a engaging down to earth vibe that helps with feeling closer to the characters and world building. A laugh fest with a beautiful dynamic that deals with the importance of family and not having to be in the world all alone. Great to see DC living up to its potential"
"2261","Hitting that shazam pose"
"2262","Shazam is fucking dope. 1st really good dc movie no <U+0001F9E2>"
"2263","So as corny as it looks, Shazam is actually really, really good"
"2264","Putting in a lot of work lately! Started editing a music video and general creative meetings with the squad. Now I’m bouta see what this Shazam talkin bout <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FE>"
"2265","Just went to watch #SHAZAM and it’s was phenomenal. Loved every second of the movie It had a 90’s superhero feel to it. It is truly amazing!<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F44D>"
"2266","Shazam &gt; Captain Marvel easily. I only compare because they shared the same name in the comics and released near each other. 

Still celebrating the success of a female superhero film, maybe we’ll finally get that Storm movie."
"2267","im gonna laugh if i ended up sitting next to those girls for shazam later"
"2268","Shazam was a lot of fun. Emmett rightly pointed out that the bully characters showed up totally unprompted, almost out of thin air with no motive. Zachary Levi was charming. Black Adam would have made better villain."
"2269","@JimLee @ponysmasher Is it not okay to say the whole movie? But if I had to pick just one scene definitely the Shazam family!"
"2270","Shazam was actually really good...I’m so proud of DC"
"2271","So the movie is damn good.

It never slows down from beginning to end. The actor playing Shazam is spot on. 
#Shazam"
"2272","Had two dudes next to me in the movie that we’re drinking Hennessy and screaming the whole during Shazam... hilarious"
"2273","Here comes the Shazam accounts that’ll die by next week."
"2274","Shazam has my favorite shot in any comic book film to date. It’s not showy, it’s not perfectly framed, Hell its not even really a great shot from a technical standpoint, but it’s a shot that made fall in love with it. It’s the Superman movie I’ve always wanted, schmultzy and fun."
"2275","He’s also Lex Luther’s dad in ‘Smallville’ so this is his third DC appearance"
"2276","Just saw Shazam. It was really good! Funny, campy, and kind of a nice change of pace... <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"2277","I've never seen the 1941 Captain Marvel serials. The Saturday morning ""Shazam!"", yes. That era was the only time you'd see a Winnebago in the same scene with Billy Batson and his mentor."
"2278","God FUCKING damn it DC Shazam was complete and utter garbage and it is a disgrace to the Captain Marvel character and comic books. Unbelievable. I am tilted"
"2279","This is your nightly reminder to go see #Shazam"
"2280","I need to watch Shazam ASAP."
"2281","Sound went out 30s before the end credits scene of Shazam.  So my theater MST3K'd it and it was fantastic."
"2282","i was so excited to have a fun friday and invited a bunch of friends to the movies to see shazam with me but nobody showed up (my cousin and one friend did though) and i found out through instagram that they were hanging out at someone’s house instead :/"
"2283","What's happening with Shazam? Can someone please fill me in?? <U+0001F602> #Shazam"
"2284","Grew up reading Shazam comics. Happy the movie was great"
"2285","It was pretty entertaining, I loved how funny it could be, and overall it was a pretty solid movie, I’m trying not to be biased since Shazam is my all time fav hero"
"2286","Ok, just got done watching SHAZAM, here are my first impressions"
"2287","@Mattch_yt @Chumychum2 @scrowder Haven't shazam, wonder woman and aquaman were good but not amazinh imo, and the old batman and superman are from completely different generations."
"2288","@AbuYoshi Which one did you prefer shazam or captain marvel? Or both are great in their own right?"
"2289","#Shazam and #TheAftermath are now showing!"
"2290","Listening to #ToriAmos and working on #pathfinderrpg character. I really want to goto a late showing of #Shazam but none around here. Will see it tomorrow afternoon."
"2291","#shazam The Captain Marvel of the #DCEU put #CarolDanvers the #CaptainMarvel of the #MCU to shame!!! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F92A><U+0001F61C><U+0001F60D><U+0001F970><U+0001F602><U+0001F44F>"
"2292","Just saw #Shazam and LOVED it! Kudos to @DCComics for another job well done! @ZacharyLevi is a national treasure!"
"2293","A reminder that all the negative #Shazam reviews were written or  recorded by adults."
"2294","@withconfidence_ @Shazam @hopelessrecords I don’t like showing my face cause ... yea anyways good luck to those who win (:"
"2295","@withconfidence_ @Shazam @hopelessrecords I don’t like showing my face cause ... yea anyways good luck to everyone (:"
"2296","@coreyj Can now confirm Shazam is pretty good. Will need to get a couple more views under my belt but I think it would be my preferred semi-regular rewatch of the DC movies released so far."
"2297","Can you believe Shazam invented body?"
"2298","@davidscottjaffe Shazam is a great reminder that the best superhero movies don't focus on the costumed hero but the man behind the costume. Captain Marvel is just eh. So Shazam for sure"
"2299","Just saw @ShazamMovie! #Shazam! has to be one of the best Superhero films I have ever seen. It surpassed my expectations. The flying sequences looked amazing. @PNemiroff @MovieMantz @JacqWashburn @EmmasListTweets @EmilyGraceCarm @EliMarietweets @bigscreenbookss @thekatiewilson"
"2300","the kid that plays freddy in shazam is a cutie i can’t lie as well as billy and one of the bullies"
"2301","I swear if Shazam ends up shit, i will never watch another DC movie ever again aside from the Dark Knight trilogy"
"2302","Just watched #ShazamMovie and it was the best so funny #shazam#awesome#hilarious#itsamust"
"2303","I am pretty sure everyone in the theater heard me say ""BITCH"" at the end of the @ShazamMovie <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> @ZacharyLevi #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"2304","i'm pissed cus my classmates are going to watch shazam now and i can't join bcs i have a schedule for lab"
"2305","Anyone who tells you the orphans in Shazam are good are lying"
"2306","Okay #DCUNIVERSE I SEE YOUUU!!! Shazam is amazing. I loved it so much. It’s sooo funny and it’ll pull on your heartstrings while simultaneously throwing something unexpected in the mix. SOOO GOOD 100/10 I seriously recommend."
"2307","Shazam gave ppl an actual diverse cast without virtue signaling and idiots still trying to pull arguments of “yea but the hero white” ignoring the plot point explaining y these ppl exists and y they’re important and not just regular ass background folks"
"2308","pretty sure shazam just saved the other dc superhero movies"
"2309","@boyluuv Yeah :/ I’m going to see Shazam in the morning and help my mom with some gardening :((( I’ll let u knwo if anything frees tho"
"2310","im convinced its the same person"
"2311",".....
#shazam is the best DC Film I've watched. Controversial opinion - I would go as far as to say it's better than Wonder Woman... Review coming soon"
"2312","Shazam was solid and honestly just fun. Tackles some interesting themes on the side you don't often see in superhero movies. 87/100"
"2313","Watched Shazam, which I'd say might be the best DC film yet. Right amounts of fun and seriousness with heart strings pulling moments thrown in there. Definitely worth checking out!"
"2314","Is it too late to start calling #Shazam a Christmas movie haha <U+0001F923><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"2315","@REKCO_J @Stemot1978 Look, Shazam! is a movie for kids, it is, yet it's WAY better than all those Panthers, Thors, Aquamans and whatnot, it deserves to make some nice money.

Not for WB, but for all those cast and crew members who made it."
"2316","Just got back from this movie and it's amazing, no lie. Definitely go see it if you can!"
"2317","I’m going to have mine for about 2 days and then come back too it in a year."
"2318","@Jayboom25 In neither captain marvel nor Shazam is a character called by the name “Captain Marvel”"
"2319","I just saw Shazam!
Loved every part of it and I'm all for @ponysmasher doing whatever the hell he wants with it.

"2321","@davidscottjaffe I just got out of Shazam and it was a fantastic movie. Imo the best DC movie since The Dark Knight"
"2322","ohyeah, went to see #Shazam 
it was rly fucken cute and fun, go watch it."
"2323","just saw @ShazamMovie  @ponysmasher  and i must say i was hesitant when found out black adams was not going to be the villian and sirvana was but when was saw the board room massacre scene dam i was blown away it gave me chills props man best dam dc movie i seen this year ."
"2324","I loved this movie!  I hope it blows Captain Marvel way out of the water."
"2325","Shazam! Is the best superhero movie ever #dc #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"2326","I am so proud of this cast and crew. They deserve the world."
"2327","Shazam was actually amazing. Easily one of my favorite comicbook/superhero movies! Anyone who isn't sure about it because of previous DC movies should seriously give it a chance. 

Also the trailers for the movie do an INSANE job not spoiling the plot!"
"2328","I just saw #Shazam ...why the hell am I Shazam in my everyday life?<U+0001F923>"
"2329","my favorite part of shazam is when billy batson said fuck cops"
"2330","I was legit planning to go out today but my mum just told me my nephew was asking where I was cos he wanted to go see Shazam with me and goddamn it <U+0001F62D>
I love that I’m that aunty but goddamn it I’ll move heaven and earth for those terrors"
"2331","Shazam is really good, btw. I hope DC keeps making good movies like this!"
"2332","It's amazing how unsurprising it is that DC can produce really good movies when they've locked Zack Snyder away in the fortress of solitude. Wonder Woman was solid. Aquaman was really good. Shazam is great. Don't let fun-suckers direct your superhero movie."
"2333","@adamschlagman @GreatWallofChin @ShazamMovie I just saw it as well, and as a fan of the books, I was amazed at how much of the fun and heart made it from the pages to the screen. The entire cast was just fantastic."
"2334","@mikezheng03 @getFANDOM @RottenTomatoes It won't. DC isn't that popular amongst casual movie goers and #Shazam wasn't promoted in the end of a movie like Infinity war with the character scheduled to appear in freaking #Endgame . But for it's budget and it's intro movie it's doing good."
"2335","Now that Shazam is out I can finally break my nda"
"2336","Alec and I left “Shazam” and we get in the car and he’s like “YOU SEE THAT LIGHTNING???”

Shut up <U+0001F602>"
"2337","@MarinJohn10 Still need to see shazam, captain marvel, us, fucking aquaman, i havent been to the movies in the LONGEST"
"2338","Shazam over Captain Marvel and I’m a marvel fanboy"
"2339","@VoteHaman @JohnTory @xoTO @WarnerBrosCA @ShazamMovie @MPACanada I always wonder how much is really made for Ontario after the tax credits."
"2340","@ShazamMovie is an easy 12/10, would recommend, would see again.
#Shazam"
"2341","@_ravioliryan Watched Shazam disappointed from it that’s about it"
"2342","@CNN SO DAMN STUPID!!!  I never knew that a southern drawl when talking to blacks in the Bronx was considered normal...”Do what”???  SHAZAM!!!"
"2343","Excited to see this movie!"
"2344","Shazam is amazing! DC is really taking their time. They’re on to something!"
"2345","I loved Shazam so fucking much. Shazam has been one of my favorite superheros for years and I was so happy when I found out they were making a movie with Asher Angel and Zachary Levi who are two actors I love.  This movie is so special, and you should all go see it."
"2346","Honestly fucking loved SHAZAM! Just watched it for the second time. Anyone who overanalyzes this film can just do us all a favor and not watch it to begin with. This is a two hours of fun and it made me feel like a kid again <U+0001F4AB><U+0001F919><U+0001F3FC><U+2665><U+FE0F><U+0001F525>"
"2347","@NoBeardSa Lmfao this is basically the plot of Shazam <U+0001F602>"
"2348","Me and @HwcdevonR really had a blast w/@PopCultureCosmo !"
"2349","Some follow up questions... 
Is this sarcasm? Did you get really great news before watching? Did you just have a fantastic day, and then watched the movie while in a great mood??!!"
"2350","@BittrScrptReadr Shoulda put on the original Superman The Movie for Shazam. More in spirit."
"2351","#Shazam I don't like that they didn't say his name is Captain Marvel just because avengers got to use their character first but come on. Friggin marvel had 2 different quicksilvers at the same time. Also this was way better than Captain Marvel. Fun flick."
"2352","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Just watched it, it was amazing, humorous, and full of surprises!!. Definitely a different type of DC movies that we are used to, but it all make sense because of Shazam! Character. And u absolutely should watch on theater!! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC><U+26A1>"
"2353","Saw #Shazam - so much fun! Does so much wish fulfillment for longtime readers that it’s hard not to love it. Ranks very high for me compared to the rest of the DCEU"
"2354","Time for @ShazamMovie. Can’t wait to see @ZacharyLevi"
"2355","I kinda wanna see Shazam...it has the same “not a masterpiece but damn fun to watch” vibes as Venom, and I loved Venom"
"2356","#SHAZAM Was a blast! Kid actors and casting were great, heart of the movie theme of ""finding your family"" was good, jokes and references/montages were a hoot, and the 3rd act finale is one of the BEST of recent comicbook fare, simple with tons of fun and surprises"
"2357","(any ""The O.C."" fans out there haha) that totally worked for the movies themes. DC is finding their grove for the feature films for sure...""RECOMMENDED!""

I give SHAZAM 10 BIG ASS BUCKETS OF BUTTERED POPCORN"
"2358","Shazam! Alternative Movie Poster on @Talenthouse #SHAZAM"
"2359","@JimLee @ponysmasher Personally? Any scenes with the foster parents and family, especially round the dinner table: a diverse, nurturing bunch, willing to open their hearts and home to Billy. To me, it's that spark, that gift to Billy, which the wizard then saw to bestow him with the power of Shazam."
"2360","The final scene of Shazam was actually pretty dope"
"2361","One of you nerds explain the Shazam post credits scene to me"
"2362","side note i’m seeing shazam today PHEW i’m so excited i hope erin and hailey are ready to hear me squeal"
"2363","Oh boy .. never enjoyed a DC movie so much ... #SHAZAM is awesome and fun <U+0001F60D>"
"2364","Just finished watching #Shazam, aka ""The Real Captain Marvel"". DC finally made a movie on par with Marvel <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>"
"2365","#ShazamMovie was very disappointing and I feel cheated."
"2366","I loved Shazam! My biggest complaint is they made the one fat guy go skinny buff instead of fat buff, in this essay I will ..."
"2367","@JimLee @ponysmasher I love love #Shazam i wish he was in justice league it would have been so much better!"
"2368","Shazam! is actually such a fun movie, I really enjoyed it. It was so heartwarming and everything and has a bunch of cute orphans, what more do you want?"
"2369","spoiler: shazam and shamwow are a part of the same cinematic universe"
"2370","@casualcinecast Though I've seen Shazam, a doc no one is watching that I found interesting is The Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story about the guy who robbed old people, Backstreet Boys and N'Sync in the 90s. Very insightful flick on @YouTube Premium."
"2371","@Espo Wait Shazam is out in the US today? I saw it two days ago here :P"
"2372","#Shazam is just the best I loved the film so so much everyone was great I loved the comedy it focuses on family and I seriously loved how it ended just loved it so so good."
"2373","My biggest problem with Shazam, that’s it’s so good it’ll be able to carry a crappy franchise/universe for another year or two. Other than that great movie"
"2374","Tangina i just wanna ditch my thesis and watch shazam and over the garden wall puta"
"2375","@ZacharyLevi out here still be awesome. #Chuck #Shazam"
"2376","#Shazam is hands down the best superhero movie to come out of the DC Universe! Heart, joy, family, fulfillment &amp; fun. Thank you @ZacharyLevi for giving us all such a great movie experience! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"2377","1) Shazam! was an excellent movie go see it!!!!
2) the Aladdin preview was so good!! I’m cryin!!
3) I really need to know who the target demographic is for the live action Dora?!?!!!!!??"
"2378","Shazam was a lot of fun. It really leaned into its cast at the end, instead of replacing them wholesale with a bunch of CG effects. If more super hero movies did that, I would like more super hero movies."
"2379","Just got home from the theater; Shazam was the perfect high note to go out on after the great day I've had. Definitely saved the best for last! This also marks the first time I've cried in a movie theater."
"2380","im 100% sure im gonna love shazam to death,,, seems to be right up my alley"
"2381","SHAZAM was fun but THE DOME absolutely sucks. Every time I tell myself it’s going to be ok and I give it a chance I have a terrible experience. An obscured view of a washed out, curvy screen. Bulldoze this fucking thing and put in an IMAX."
"2382","Just saw Shazam with my girlfriend and Pedro is a gay icon"
"2383","I've seen it twice and definitely my favorite DC movie in a close flip for the second spot before #WonderWoman and  #SupermanTheMovie at number one."
"2384","shazam is such a good movie. also freddy freeman is so cute. i smiled so much"
"2385","Just back from seeing #Shazam.  Fun movie.  @ZacharyLevi was perfect in it."
"2386","hypetrain for this year destination : shazam, john wick chapter 3, joker"
"2387","Wow, 6 #Shazam and Superman #ShazamMovie"
"2388","@notyrqtpie if want funny laughing movie choose shazam, crying emotional movie five feet apart. heheh"
"2389","No waaaay Takehito and Ogata?! 

They're two of my favourite voice actors!"
"2390","This is nice, definitely, though at this point of my life, I'm no longer settling for POC to play supporting characters and not leads in their own stories."
"2391","@Angel_Central Super strength, speed and flight SHAZAM!!!!"
"2392","I think Shazam’s representation is really great and authentic- everybody should see one of the family up there and relate to them in several different ways- and it’s honestly kinda frustrating how little credit that gets because they chose just to do it and not to parade it."
"2393","Did someone put a gun to his head? <U+0001F914> Because that strains so hard to find something positive <U+0001F61D><U+0001F61D>"
"2394","I loved #Shazam but can people knock off the “fuck #CaptainMarvel “ quotes? Not saying you can’t prefer it, just saying they’re both good and inspiring for different reasons, you don’t have to trash one movie to praise another, especially when they’re tackling different subjects"
"2395","@JimLee @ponysmasher Freddy and Billy/Shazam chilling, discovering powers and bonding. Darla, Eugene, Sivana and the cool final fight."
"2396","going to mute some of you because ugghh you're slowly approaching to the spoiler zone for shazam"
"2397","Excluding The Dark Knight ofc"
"2398","@ryno1185 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie I loved it and have now developed a crush on @ZacharyLevi #Shazam"
"2399","@wyattyhalpert My dad is getting tired of superhero movies, but accompanied me to Shazam (and was delightfully surprised by it, he said ""it wasn't what I expected""), and he wants to see Endgame simply to get the end of the story (and potential time travel). I think after that he's pooped"
"2400","@Gurupatel147 you didn't like it much? because I LOVED AQUAMAN, still supposed to watch shazam"
"2401","Shazam 
. Zachary Levi deserves every bit of love in the world 
. The first movie in the DCEU(?) that stays completely true to the comic’s spirit
. Absolutely hysterical 
. Jack Dylan Grazer deserves us forgetting about his awkward apology video 
. Santa is the best character"
"2402","Shazam was great. 

But also I’m amazed it mentions the game Uplink by name. That’s kind of a deep cut for a mainstream blockbuster."
"2403","Now officially a fan boy of #Shazam"
"2404","I’m a server at a restaurant and alllll day today I was telling my tables that they needed to go see Shazam because it’s the cutest and funniest movie! I literally cannot stop talking about how much I love this movie and how incredible @ZacharyLevi is!"
"2405","Shazam is by far the best DC movie made, thanks @Cooliocx for taking mee"
"2406","So when do we get the Snyder cut of SHAZAM?"
"2407","Not entirely sure why people are so happy with Shazam being on track to make 40M worldwide. It had about 100M. That's not even half of its budget lol"
"2408","Not entirely sure why people are happy with Shazam being on track to make 40M worldwide this weekend. The movie had a 100M budget. That isn't even half."
"2409","Went to watch Shazam with my friends and it was really great :) 8/10"
"2410","@Terri_Schwartz It’s a very marvel style dc movie, I liked it, but still think Aquaman and WonderWoman were better. But #ShazamMovie is very good."
"2411","Okay okay. I gotta say this. I probably still will a couple hundred more times in the next few days but Shazam!!!! That was an intensely, insanely incredible experience."
"2412","Looking at the comments shows how many people haven’t seen #Shazam and not knowing what diversity is."
"2413","+ like Luke in TWD or I can move both David and Lana to maybes for Zachary from Shazam if I don't win the contest.  Ugh... why does this gotta be hard to decide who to meet?"
"2414","@ZacharyLevi I love you in #ShazamMovie but been loving you since #CHUCK <U+0001F973><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"2415","Um. @ShazamMovie. LOVED IT. @ZacharyLevi, you are my absolute favorite. The end.

"2416","shazam was actually really good and i forgot legend was in it i almost started crying :("
"2417","Actual conversation with my best friend.

""So my buddy said Shazam was funny.""

""Like the Shaq movie?""

""What? No. The superhero movie.""

""Shaq was a superhero. And a genie.""

I don't know why I put up with him sometimes...

"2418","The latest hot takes claiming Shazam! is fat-shaming make me want to quit the internet."
"2419","@TheKeyz12 would have the power to make duplicates of things or people. #ShazamXbox"
"2420","I'm predicting that after Shazam,Joker and Birds of Prey WB are going to be more interested in low-mid budget movies (by CBM standards) for the DC films ...hell we got the Trench coming already"
"2421","I agree with this, to a certain extent. Parents will know what their child can handle. That said, I'm not sure this is a movie for very young children. 
There's some imagery they might find disturbing."
"2422","Me and the boys waiting in line at the bathroom because we drank too much"
"2423","@di_ndakw Despite that shazam very entertaining hero moviee!"
"2424","@danny_9000 Yes.
Shazam is voiced by Sugita, Koyasu Takehito voices the villain and there's also Sakaguchi."
"2425","We went and saw #ShazamMovie tonight and I cannot recommend it enough! Heart and humor and still some of that dark DC story sprinkled in. A new unexpected fav <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"2426","#Shazam feels like it'll be an Antman type of movie for me. Meaning, fun entertaining movie that I can watch over and over again."
"2427","@ZacharyLevi We went to see it opening day here in Manila, and my friend and I absolutely loved it. It was so funny and heartwarming. We think you are absolutely perfect as Shazam. <U+0001F600>"
"2428","My God nobody asked you. Pay any attention to Twitter ITKS and you'll probably not enjoy anything in this life."
"2429","Wanted to watch Shazam and Pet Sematary <U+0001F60C>"
"2430","@Payt__ttv @BRlSKET Lol <U+0001F602> Shazam will be Second Best Super Hero movie this year though ngl"
"2431","Shazam! Is opening earlier in my country (3rd) than the official premiere date and like, I've watched it 2 times in the span of 3 days (watching it again on Monday lol). @ZacharyLevi and the kids performance is captivating. He's going to be what RDJ and Ryan Reynolds is to Marvel"
"2432","I just got done watching the @ShazamMovie and it was freaking awesome I highly recommend it"
"2433","SPOILERS
So #Shazam is just the movie ""Big"" but set in Herotown, USA?
The Shazam toy store floor piano scene was awesome!
Uh oh, their could have been a kissing scene, but Shazam is actually 10.
Shazam and the kid are fighting because Shazam wants to do big boy stuff.
End credits"
"2434","Shit, over the moon happy that @ShazamMovie takes place in Philadelphia #SHAZAM"
"2435","@JesabelRaay @theonlytroyever Shazam is literally a 15 year old that becomes a superhero. There’s no 180. It’s not BvS but it shouldn’t be. Maybe it won’t be for you but that’s not on the film. Not everyone will like every film, doesn’t mean it can’t be good and doesn’t mean it’s pointless"
"2436","Common,you should be able to tell from the trailer that the movie no go make am at all."
"2437","Settling in for 20mins of ads THEN the trailers <U+0001F62B> so unnecessary. #Shazam"
"2438","i’m seeing it on monday with my friend ! i’m so hype, i’ve been excited for it since last autumn"
"2439","Seeing Shazam! tomorrow in iMAX. Should be fun"
"2440","I watching movies on my computer <U+0001F4BB> dc movie Shazam"
"2441","The movie Shazam is awesome. @ZacharyLevi  is awesome in this movie and I saw @TheRock in the credits."
"2442","So in this world Batman is a feared urban legend who tortures and brands criminals so they'll be murdered in prison and also is a popular mass produced child's doll. The guy's got a good agent."
"2443","Damn Shazam is sooooooo awesome! Great job, DC! I much prefer this hero than the waterman guy <U+0001F605>"
"2444","An amazing film filled with super funny dialogues and hilarious scenes all through, while keeping the superhero theme alive. A complete family entertainer. DO NOT give this a miss. I rate it a 8/10.
@ShazamMovie #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"2445","Shazam is a overrated movie. It was given so many opportunities to be great but felt rushed, incomplete and, as if it lost what type of movie it wanted to be. Better then most of the DC collection but that’s not say much..."
"2446","Ok, @ShazamMovie is definitely one of the funniest superhero movies I've watched yet.

I was non stop laughing at many parts of the movie.

Excellent movie. DC in the right direction now!"
"2447","Went to see #Shazam last night, funny at parts, think it could have been better though! <U+0001F914>"
"2448","watched shazam . dc should stick to this stand alone ish sort of movies . don't try to follow marvel . you suck at that . stick to this formula . it works ."
"2449","I watched Shazam last night and it made me cry. Which made me realize I don't think I've watched a single superhero movie that hasn't made me cry so like why the HELL am I so sensitive? Even the Deadpool movies made me cry <U+0001F611>"
"2450","So Shazam isn’t Kazaam?!? I was really confused why @SHAQ wasn’t involved in the remake <U+0001F602>"
"2451","Dam Shazam was so good!!! Y’all know what scene got me emotional af!!! Def must watch movie!"
"2452","How the hell did Shazam get a 91% on RottenTomatoes? That shit was straight diarrhea. Is this some sort of late April fool's prank?"
"2453","Cutest part of getting to watch #Shazam,  little kid yelling out that ""he CAN fly!"" I mean @ZacharyLevi is too but that stole the show, the whole theater loved it. @ShazamMovie"
"2454","Just got done watching #Shazam and I was quite entertained. 3rd best #DC Film thus far! Well worth the price of admission!"
"2455","my only problem with Shazam! was the soundtrack. pretty forgettable and to reminiscent of everything we heard in 80's/early 90's movies which made it sound a little dated to my taste."
"2456","@ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher  @DCComics.. Just saw  #Shazam ..and it is just the best .. there wasn't any moment where I didn't shout out with joy... Kudos to the entire team, for doing their best job.. Loved every Character, dialogues..

"2457","#SHAZAM was so good!!! I loved @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial in it!"
"2458","Kinda f**king bangs. One of the best written superhero movie screenplays possibly... ever. It's a really fun film with tons of hearts and hints of darkness that David F. Sandberg directs very well. Good work from everyone who worked on it."
"2459","#Shazam is great. Funny, believable motivations and a simple structure. 
In the battle of the Captain Marvels, I would never have imagined a DC film would so easily beat a Marvel one in sheer entertainment.
There's a mid-credits scene AND an end-credits one."
"2460","Shazam! (2019) is a FUN film! :D I enjoyed it far more then I thought I would, and it shows that, with a good script - DC can do good movies! Well worth a watch!"
"2461","Heard Good reviews of DC Shazam. Going to Watch it soon"
"2462","@vadersdisciple A few years ago pa.... Geoff Johns wrote the new 52 origin of #SHAZAM and guess who wrote the movie?"
"2463","Shazam is actually kind of a good movie. Better movies from DC for sure!"

"2480","The same goes for me. I forced myself in and left the cinema almost crying <U+0001F920>"
"2481","@_andrew_03 where’s that Shazam review !!?!?"
"2482","So Shazam is essentially Space Jam if the main villain was the ball the Monstars got their powers from. But instead of them taking their powers from the ball they just went into the ball and chilled until it was time for some supervillain shit."
"2483","@ShazamMovie was really good. @ZacharyLevi and #markstrong kicks real ass! Mark strong is the best DCEU villain since Shannon’s Zod! This movie has heart, and is super fun. Go watch it NOW!! Shazaammm!!! #ShazamMovie #shazam"
"2484","@kecl3on A friend of mine has a theory that the flash movie is gonna be a flashpoint film(which basically means its a reboot)

Which would be hilarious 

But between Wonder Woman, aqua man and Shazam all being just plain fun, I... kinda hope not? There’s hope yet for the DCEU."

"2504","Hmmmm is the heat a sign for me to go and watch a movie :/ (specifically SHAZAM!<U+26A1>)"
"2505","Ok but let me be real, Shazam is probably my favorite DC movie. It’s wholesome, fun, very memorable, inspired, and generally has a strong “feel-good” sense to it you don’t see in a lot of movies."
"2506","Who gave the Shazam the right to be that fun?

Gimme more that was so fun holy shit."
"2507","@BBW_BFF I need to go to sleep, because I saw Donner-esque and went straight to the Donner party, and was wondering how they factored cannibalism into Shazam."

"2509","Best DC movie since the dark night"
"2510","#ShazamMovie go see it. They got so many things right. There were elements in this movie that every Superman movie missed. Words can’t express how good this movie is. The trailer doesn’t show anything! Low key kind of intense for kids."
"2511","I legit thought people were talking about the Shazam app and were wilding. Turns out there is a movie. What even"
"2512","best part was how they didn’t have to explain why the characters were present. they were just allowed to exist in that world instead of being paraded around like “look at us we’re so diverse!1!1!” like most hollywood movies do."
"2513","i’m just so impressed with how well the humour was handled in shazam. the cringey, forced, mcu type of humour is VOMIT-inducing but every single humourous moment in shazam came organically from the situations they were in &amp; the relationships between the characters. SO brilliant."
"2514","Shazam is probally the best DC movie so far."
"2515","maybe you made several points with Shazam! @ponysmasher"
"2516","Love that Justice League is nowhere to be found"
"2517","Love how it taps into every adults inner child &amp; let's actual children live out their dreams of being heroes as well."
"2518","Good morning, go see the #SHAZAM. I've never seen such a wholesome superhero movie. Brings out DC's best qualities of understanding their own character tones, well timed humour and truly emotional moments. Plus, if you want to see what diversity should look like, see this film."

"2526","It’s been nice just to hangout with some of the bros from the chapter and just converse about everything and anything these past couple days. Also seen Shazam...would definitely recommend."
"2527","@ShazamMovie was pretty awesome. I had a real fun time. @ZacharyLevi is so perfect for the role of shazam. It maybe had some weird pacing sometimes and stuff but overall it was great."

"2532","So I've watched Shazam! just now. And holy crap, it was amazing! If you think kids can't be superheroes, think again. I can't spoil it to y'all, so you have to watch it by yourself."
"2533","i want to go see shazam can somebody please come watch shazam with me"
"2534","While I was dissatisfied with #Shazam, I still think people should see it. It’s a really fun film with lots of humor and childlike moments. Just go and don’t think too hard about it, which I think is what they want of us, and I think you’ll enjoy yourself."
"2535","Being a lover of OG Captain Marvel, this film wasn’t really for me. There are too many gripes for me to ignore. Personally, I think Aquaman is better. LOTS of people will love Shazam! though which is great. Congrats to the cast and crew of this film and good luck in the future!!!"
"2536","While I was dissatisfied with “Shazam!”, I still think people should people see it. It’s a very fun film with lots of humor. Just go and don’t think too hard about it and you’ll enjoy yourself which I think is what we’re expected to do."
"2537","As a lover of OG Captain Marvel, this film wasn’t for me. Too many gripes to ignore and give it the two thumbs way up that I was expecting to give it before it came out. Personally liked Aquaman better. LOTS of people will love “Shazam!” tho which is great!"
"2538","Congratulations to the cast &amp; crew of #Shazam on it’s success and best of luck in the future!!"
"2539","#Shazam an awesome, fun movie. Congrats @ZacharyLevi on all the success. Truly well deserved!!!"
"2540","why is everyone in the comments so mad pLEASE"
"2541","one thing i loved about shazam is that they didn’t use the diversity of the family for advertising but rather made it a normal and daily thing that doesn’t rely on selling it as a product"
"2542","#SHAZAM is thoroughly entertaining. Had a blast watching it!!"
"2543","#Shazam was awesome! What really got to me was when Freddy was telling billy how hard it is for him to get noticed and not be felt sorry for. I’ve struggled with that for years! #truth"

"2547","Shazam was 9/10 amazing. It’s full of heart and charisma. The cast was full of energy and that really shined. The whole idea of family was BEAUTIFULLY executued to the point to where it had me tearing up. 

The action could’ve been better, but wow. This is a fantastic movie."
"2548","#Shazam is so good!! The comic parts are mostly hilarious.. N the emotional parts are at the right place.

"2552","@TheJLew The truth is Shazam was campy and underwhelming. It was as if Captain Marvel was more like a kid &amp; Billy Batson was more of an adult. I always thought the choice to cast Levi in the role was wrong &amp; I stand by that. The blatantly padded suit is horrendous."

Worth watching once though"

"2563","@dvearse @ShazamMovie Aquaman is great, it is in my Top 10 list, but I like Watchmen more"
"2564","Really enjoyed Shazam! By far the funniest DC movie. Glad the trailers didn't reveal key plot points. #ShazamMovie"
"2565","@althepal_ Looool I just got done watching Shazam. I'll pop a monster and be on in the next 45"
"2566","Seeing contradictory opinions on Shazam. Same thing that happened with Captain Marvel. Better to watch it myself and form an opinion."
"2567","the issue I have with @ShazamMovie is; why weren't you shown in 4th quarter of last year? this would have been perfect for Nov-Dec! I love the movie though"
"2568","Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and now #Shazam, DCEU's future is looking bright!"
"2569","Half my TL says Shazam is trash. The usual movie critics lol. And then the other half says it's great.

This is why YOU should watch a movie yourself and not let your opinion of it be based on other people's opinions lol"
"2570","@TrustMyCraze I’m so excited. I start my minor stay-cation today. I see Shazam tomorrow, got a Wrestlemania party Sunday and took Monday off to recoup. The perfect way to spend time off IMHO. <U+0001F917>"

"2576","I was thinking since supernatural is ending can the DC people please cast @JensenAckles to play Batman so that @ZacharyLevi as Shazam can be in the same movie like the next Justice league, would seriously make my heart and eyes Happy because I mean they're so dang attractive <U+0001F60D>."

"2579","#Shazam - A funny Superhero film! Billy - Freddie chemistry is superb. Great perf from Levi. Villain character is weak. Biggest strength is the humour, infact it saves the film. Climax fight might be enjoyed by the kids. CGI could hv been better. 1 tym watch Popcorn Entertainer!!"
"2580","Aka the plot of Shazam I guess??"
"2581","@KatarHol5 Correct. At the same time these characters appeared in a medium that is suppose to be accessible to all. 

MCU, &amp; lately Wonder Woman, Aquaman, &amp; Shazam introduced us to characters as accessible, fun &amp; joyful to the world. Deconstruction can happen later. Marvel did in Civil War."
"2582","@Jkuba_98 definitely this. my biggest issues with captain marvel were mostly it’s dullness and carol danver’s lack of relatability. shazam has that heart/intensity and relatability/depth that i think CM could’ve def benefitted with."
"2583","@Jkuba_98 it’s actually crazy looking at the parallels between both movies besides both being named captain marvel with how identity and the past play crucial roles in both hero’s arcs, shazam just told a better origin story"
"2584","Then don’t try to talk."
"2585","Not like there’s a lot of competition tho."
"2586","@GraceRandolph Unfortunately Shazam got overshadowed this week with those Avengers tickets going on sale and The Joker trailer doing so well. Studio should have stepped up on marketing and there should have been final trailer showing some of the climax to get people interested. #ShazamMovie"
"2587","Even if Shazam were to be flopping (which it isn't), it wouldn't convince WB to release the Snyder cut, nor would it make them switch to strictly having a ""dark"" films mandate cause that defeats the fucking purpose of a director driven universe you miserable fucks."
"2588","@JRodriguez_PhD I was pleasantly surprised....it was much better than I expected! Fun to watch and good special effects. Not sure how it is character-wise as I am not all that familiar with Shazam from the comics."

"2591","fuck you #ShazamMovie that song belongs to shaun of the dead so fuck off"
"2592","My hot take of the day: #shazam is anti-abortion propaganda."
"2593","BREAKING: #Shazam opens w/ strong estimated $20M Fri (Including $5.9M Thurs); On track for $51.5M+ opening weekend, in line w/ forecasts. Kids give it solid 72% recommend; Gen audiences give it 61%. (Aquaman scored 89%/82% respectively). More accurate totals later this weekend."
"2594","Is there a scene in #Shazam where he's fighting Batman and then reveals his real name is Billy Batson and Batman stops because he also has a Bat son?"
"2595","@HuionTab @ShazamMovie That is awesome:)"
"2596","Shazam was everything that I expected. Best DC movie. That ending tho"
"2597","Hyderabad next Galerie Mall.  It's a Amazing experience going from Metro passway.  We went to Shazam and its Amazing<U+0001F495><U+0001F60D> movie. Don't miss it."

"2602","Can’t believe the disrespect i’m seeing on the timeline from people referring to the awesome AF John Glover as “that guy from -insert title-“ in Shazam. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"

"2606","Man I have to say Shazam was great funny superhero movie to see!"
"2607","Shazam was a pretty good movie, I definitely recommend y’all to go watch it."
"2608","Loved Shazam!! Highly recommended"
"2609","#Shazam is a really entertaining, wholly charming adventure that gets the underlying wish-fulfillment fantasy of superheroes and earns its 80s movie comparisons with a surplus of heart and a dash of nightmare fuel."
"2610","I had a lot of fun at Shazam! I only wanted one thing from the sequel and they gave it to me in the first one! But about that sequel, every movie is better with more Meagan Good.  Write that down."
"2611","Enjoyed #shazam and @ZacharyLevi Asher Angel were both great. 

Can I also wish that the film leaned even more into the funny-naive-learning-to-superhero-“Big” concept though? That was a treat"
"2612","Yes. This explains how I felt something was “off”. 
Mr Maltin must know a bit about movies eh... <U+0001F643>"
"2613","#SHAZAM first 60 min was dark and I loved it!! Perfect balance by @ponysmasher!! Humour scary and emotions"
"2614","I feel like Shazam didn’t get as much advertising as other superhero stuff. I remember Aquaman and Captain Marvel being plastered everywhere but I don’t think I saw as much Shazam."
"2615","Go and see this movie! #Shazam  Take your friends and your whole family too! <U+0001F4AF>% guaranteed fun!"
"2616","@getyourcomicon Love #Shazam even more today especially discussing it with family this morning. What did you think after your 3rd viewing"

"2618","@ZacharyLevi I love #ShazamMovie  I think I might need medical attention for the huge smile I cracked while watching it.  It was just the most amount of fun."
"2619","They ain’t even have to force anything either"
"2620","You'll love @ShazamMovie if you liked...

Ghostbusters, Big, The Goonies, Home Alone, Jingle All The Way, Superman.
Basically, if you grew up with Harold Ramis, Robert Zemickis, Steven Spielberg movies, you've got to see it.

"2621","Not a #Shazam spoiler, but can someone explain to me why Billy Batson goes to a school that apparently has elementary, middle, and high schoolers all in one building and cafeteria? Is this a Philadelphia thing?"
"2622","Got back from seeing @ZacharyLevi in Shazam. He’s perfect for this role. Thought it was outstanding! Wonderful humor, great action, some very cool surprises and a really cool credit scene which comic book readers will love. Mark Strong was great as always. Go See It!"
"2623","Also go see shazam please it’s so good I nearly cried at least 7 times but maybe that’s bc I’m a baby that wishes I had a proper family"
"2624","@Dricky_ Hahaha Shazam no be serious movie in the fess place"
"2625","Some of the Spider-Verse fans are just so fucking rude towards Shazam. Just shut the fuck up."
"2626","two things learned tonight : 
1) dancing is possible while wearing glasses
2) a @solardomusic is way too good to shazam

#dallas"
"2627","Damn so Shazam (according twitter and the critics) was actually good?<U+0001F914>"
"2628","It’s so refreshing watching a movie and not even having to think about diversity, because it feels so natural."
"2629","Aquaman was silly but the silliness felt accidental and due to bad writing. Shazam’s silliness feels clever and thoughtful"
"2630","The beginning of Shazam! is kinda ...... but once Zachary Levi shows up the movie gets great. The climax is actually the best part. It’s not some overly dramatic cgi nonsense nor is it silly. It’s genuinely funny and clever"
"2631","Like Shazam’s shitty costume full of padding is actually part of the plot. It’s shitty on purpose. The entire movie is like that. If it’s “bad”, it’s very self aware about it and it’s part of the plot. Nothing is accidentally bad in the movie"
"2632","@Luiz_Fernando_J Critics &amp; audience are in love with  film. I think this will give Shazam the boost in its opening weekend. What do you think Luiz ? Can Shazam post a opening of $60M total in the domestic circuits ?"
"2633","@Luiz_Fernando_J @ArjunRe20194705 Yeah I know what you mean. Shazam has Endgame on its trail. Which will hit the theaters in 3 weeks. There are also several other films in May as well. So the legs won't be too long for Shazam. Still $500M+ would be a big success for Shazam :)"
"2634","@Luiz_Fernando_J Both critics &amp; audience are in love with this film. I think this will give Shazam the boost in its opening weekend. Can Shazam post a opening of $60M total in the domestic circuits ? What're your thoughte Luiz ?"
"2635","Caught a late showing of Shazam! 
It's a big relief when a film doesn't take itself so seriously compared to its predecessors. Villain is boring and forgettable, but Zachary Levi nails the role. 
Also one of his adopted sisters is fucking adorable and steals the scene sometimes."
"2636","It's weird but i mostly know Shazam because of the Injustice games, and i keep thinking ""man, Superman fucking killed you with his laser vision"""
"2637","yo don't sleep on Shazam just cuz Endgame is coming
it's a VERY GREAT movie"
"2638","Shazam was easily one of the best DC movies we’ve had in a long fucking time wow Shit was amazing"
"2639","@ZacharyLevi was awesome in @ShazamMovie but not as awesome as @AsherAngel. Why am I comparing ? They were both AWESOME. They still are"
"2640","#SHAZAM is a fun packed movie with a few hidden gems and a few parts it had me jumping out of my chair oh and I think I saw a #BlackAdam magical hologram casted by the wizard at during the start of the movie! 

Great origin story! @ZacharyLevi @DCComics @ShazamMovie"
"2641","Suicide Squad and Shazam stay the two most diverse comicbook movies so far. Thanks for joining my TED talk <U+2728>"
"2642","stans being bothered by the fact that Shazam is much more diverse than any em see you movie pretty much reveals how little they care for actual diversity.

“*blInKs iN bLaCk pAtNhER!1!1!!!*”

Yeah. No."
"2643","Going to watch shazam"
"2644","going to watch Shazam today!!!"
"2645","@iconicaesthetic Yes, please do. Seriously, Shazam does nothing to be like Shazam. It's like criticizing Us for trying to be Dawn of the Dead and not being the same."
"2646","And those two leading boys in shazam was very charming i just hope they never grow up. Really they're so sweet"
"2647","And those two leading boys in shazam was very charming i just hope they never grow up. Really they were so sweet"

"2649","@JuliWyant Yes! Right? I thought that the film was a cool representation of the seven deadly sins. Like you, I'm not familiar with Shazam, so not sure how the narrative arch in the film compares to the original story."
"2650","Shazam was somehow more cheesy than I expected.
It also wasn't as good as I expected
It was alright. Kids will love it. Glad it happened. Need more Zachary Levi in my life."
"2651","@HawksHolocrons @MCU_Chris @0berisk I just personally thought the opening 20 mins was one of the weaker parts of the film. Really anything w/ Dr. Sivana was kinda meh. But Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, Jack Grazer &amp; the whole Shazam family were A+. I loved Billy discovering his powers with Freddy, the family dynamics"
"2652","@HawksHolocrons @MCU_Chris @0berisk I legitimately lol’d a ton in the theater. Comedy landed most of the time and was seriously funny. Just for me, the antagonist(s) were pretty weak and took away from how great all the members of the Shazam family were, so it felt like the movie really ebbed and flowed in quality"
"2653","Going to see Shazam! Movie"
"2654","@tcm My double feature:
“Beyond the Valley of the Dolls” and “Shazam!”"

"2656","#Shazam was a really great and fun film, it's good to see a DC film that doesn't take itself too seriously and can embrace some of the more silly aspects of a comic book universe. Keep up quality like this and the #DCEU might be saved yet!"
"2657","I’m gonna go ahead and say it, Shazam is the best DC movie since the Batman series"
"2658","Shazam has a lot of heart. A lot of hilarity and a lot of suspense. The Effects in the movie were simple but done perfectly. It felt like how a superhero movie should be. Not heavy on the CGI but with heart and simplicity!"

Well I did but then turned around and continued to laugh and clap. 

Don’t go to a comedy movie if you don’t want ppl laughing idiot."
"2664","Shazam is a cute cheesy wholesome movie highly recommend lol"
"2665","SHAZAM! (2019)
IMDB: 7.3/10

"2721","@samnoaches This doesn’t please me. I was looking forward to the movie.

How come Shazam doesn’t have a Cinema Score, yet?"
"2722","@Luiz_Fernando_J I'm honestly not worried at all because people need to remember that Shazam got a last-minute release in China.

Some people ought to be thankful it's even making money at all.

What's important is that it's surging in the US where the box office matters most."

"2732","I saw #Shazam recently.

It was funny,heartwarming,entertaining with a few surprisingly dark moments. The first act was kind of rough,had iffy CG,the villain was bland,&amp; the bullies were over the top.Zachary Levi was very convincing as a 14 year old in a man's body.

Rating: 8/10"
"2733","Going to watch Shazam after my shift today <U+0001F601> usually as you tell by my posts I like watching films on my day off and making a nice day out of it but nah can't wait to watch this! #Shazam #DCUNIVERSE #film #cineworld"

I give it 7/10 on the Cannon scale."

Shazam! was very enjoyable, funny, &amp; silly - but not too silly. All art is subjective but going against the majority just to be different always seems to come across a bit odd. “Food??

After recent blunders in 2017, Shazam was remarkably good as it kept  Zack Snyder's Superman's after effects on kids &amp; his family centred themes.

"2776","#SHAZAM was so great and lovely. The movie has something good to say and it says it so well. And they were not scared to lay out all the cards, without keeping them for possible sequels. I grinned through the whole final smack down ;v;"
"2777","Saw 'Shazam!' which stars @ZacharyLevi and @gracecfulton the film itself is fantastic, even going as far to say the better Captain Marvel film. In my humble opinion it is the best DC film since 'Batman Returns' (1992). Everyone involved should be proud #Shazam #DC #CaptainMavel"
"2778","UMR: #SHAZAM its no secret I'm more of a fan DC comics over Marvel(which I equally enjoy) but I'm no expert on Shazam, however, the movie is great, bright, colourful, hopeful and yes very funny! I sensed undertones of homecoming, it and stranger things! which is a huge compliment"

Minus a couple nitpicks

Would say the best is probably still Wonder Woman"
"2792","I just watch Shazam. 
Don't like the comedy that much because I would prefer darker tone ( well I expected this but my friend really likes it. She is not usually into superheroes movies ) 
I love Shazam. About a 7/10."

"2798","i’m sleeping on DC movies more than i should be. i’ve heard plenty of good things about Aquaman but haven’t watched it yet. heard that Shazam is one of the greatest super hero movies so i for sure have to check that out. and the Joker movie looks mad decent."

"2819","Got to see #Shazam after a tiring week and I must say that its energetic, light-hearted fun and sense of wonder is DC at its best in showcasing its heroes. DC has back to back hits that's gold."
"2820","I slept and I woke up and Shazam is still one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen The Meg (2018) and Hell And Back (2015)"
"2821","I'm being peer pressured into watching #Shazam"
"2822","@ShazamMovie rocks. @DCComics movies are WAY better when they aren’t channeling Frank Miller’s overweight high school football coach Batman.

"2861","I'm hearing so mixed reviews about Shazam. It's either a 10/10 or bobo"
"2862","SHAZAM! feels much more grounded than a lot of the superhero films we’ve been getting recently, and it’s to the films benefit. The film captures the thrill of the superhero’s double life, how much damn fun it would be to be that powerful in a regular setting."
"2863","With the release of SHAZAM! I feel confident in proudly stating that Warner Bros. are finally on the right track."
"2864","I still can't quite get over how GOOD #Shazam was! It might possibly be one of the very best superhero films ever (at least, in this current crop)."
"2865","What I’m basically saying is: if DC are able to keep making these high-quality, distinct features then maybe, just maybe, someday they’ll surpass the MCU. 
Maybe. 
In any case, SHAZAM! is one of the very best movies of the year so far and it absolutely deserves your love!"
"2866","It feels a lot more “real world” than a lot of other superhero films recently, and that’s not just due to the fact that this movie isn’t 90% greenscreens. 
SHAZAM! is a relatively light-hearted film, but it’s got some edge to it."
"2867","The cast, of course, help this a long. The main attraction of course is Zachary Levi as Shazam himself and he is an absolute delight, bringing the laughs and the awesomeness required to the role."
"2868","Wonder Woman, Aquaman and SHAZAM! are all good to great films that operate on entirely different scales, use entirely different visual languages and provide entirely different thrills."
"2869","I don’t just mean in terms of the genuinely nightmarish “will-absolutely-traumatise-your-4-year-old” monsters that Shazam faces off against, but also in terms of themes."
"2870","But the MVPs are Asher Angel as Billy and Jack Dylan Grazer, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen, Jovan Armand and Grace Fulton as his foster family. A lot of the film’s emotional beats are built around these 6 and they nail it. They are the reason that SHAZAM! works as well as it does."
"2871","This movie tackles some pretty heavy subject matter, and there is a moment in here that is heart-breaking for just how real and raw and emotional it is. SHAZAM! honestly made me tear up, and didn’t even need to kill Spider-Man to do it!"
"2872","@RICHARDLNEWBY I only really like Man of Steel, WW, Aquaman and Shazam!, But Aquaman is legit one of my new favorite movies. It's such a joy, I've thrown it on a few times when I've felt down in the dumps and it's so comforting."

But in my opinion. Didn’t do justice to what Shazam is. And look at the blooming costume. What is this? Power rangers?"
"2894","@_Olamidee @nonsoikenwa Don’t be fooled.  Watch it yourself. It’s excellent. 
Captain marvel has a much worse rating than Shazam."
"2895","@00amby @i_ampete Shazam is easily 3 times better than Aquaman. No comparison."
"2896","It’s the best DC movie in ages. 90+% user and critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 
Don’t listen to this feller!"
"2897","@GraceRandolph They never should screen the movie two(!!!!) weeks in advance, I think one week would be perfect. But yeah, packed schedule, people just saw CM, and bought tickets voor Endgame. Shazam def won’t have long legs."

"2995","@MiaSanKroNoS @BobDigi69 No, since the goal is to remove any vision similar to that of Zack to treat comics characters (In a realistic way). It started with Joostice League and become operational in Aquaman then this continues with Shazam and soon WW84."

"3001","Yup just like i expected people started to get mad about that #Superman suit cameo in #SHAZAM . 
#ShazamMovie"
"3002","@Vnom307 Imo Both are great but I felt more connected to Shazam.
It doesn't have spectacular visuals or fighting sequences like Aquaman but i liked Shazam better purely because of the characters."
"3003","If anyone couldn’t tell this from the movie poster alone, something must be wrong with you"
"3004","#ShazamMovie Was incredible. I'd rate it number 3 in the DCEU, after MoS and BvS. The recent suit change and lack of face at the end was a bit disappointing but that doesn't ruin it. 7.8/10

Also @ponysmasher I think you made a kid cry in my screening (during the boardroom scene)"
"3005","Today consists of #ShazamMovie and #PetSematary"
"3006","I actually saw Shazam in Cineworld Milton Keynes' 270-degree immersive ""Screen X"" system with some scenes having extra stuff projected on the cinema side walls; to be honest I found it distracting but I don't think I'd have liked it more in standard Normalvision."
"3007","Saw SHAZAM yesterday and it's undone any goodwill I had towards DC after being very pleasantly surprised by AQUAMAN. Sole highlights: Mark Strong villainry and Benjamin Wallfisch's ""you can actually hear the woodwinds"" score (only really prominent over the end credits)."
"3008","How is the movie Shazam (2019) going on?"
"3009","No Forced Humor, No Candy Address, No Compromising the Story Arc for Entertainment. That's DC (by Warner Bros) for you."
"3010","I really want to see Shazam. I hope it gets a lot of money so DC will realise we’re tired of gritty superhero movies and give us more light hearted stuff."
"3011","#Shazam,  well done. @ZacharyLevi absolutely nailed it. <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"

   Shazam is the adult superhero comedy movie which fun unlimited us and then i cannot say because the movie is about the experience not for the review

"3017","@TeamSatisfacti3 @rolltidered @drmoore @ShazamMovie The only weak part in WW was the last act and even then it wasn't that bad, and had so much impact with its message."
"3018","Watched @ShazamMovie and it was brilliant, great story and message while being funny/serious the right amount. I still like the dark theme of Batman but this was a great standard for DC to set for their movies (it’s better than a large number of the Marvel ones)"
"3019","Shazam absolutely deserves to do them Aquaman numbers. It might be the best DCEU movie. It doesnt have the stirring, inspirational approach of WW, but its unironic, gleeful approach will, I hope, make it a big hit for kids."
"3020","Key takeaways from #Shazam 
1. DCEU movies are gradually improving. Still a bit more work needed to reach their full potential. 
2. A well-placed Street Fighter reference will make dweebs lose their minds. 
3. Meagan Good is still hot."

"3028","I always bare in my mind that #Shazam production cost 80 million. It's a small budget for cvm movie. So, there will be some noticeable cgi in fight scene and that's okay. After second time watched this, I'd love to gove 8/10 rating! It's sooo enjoyable!"

"3053","#Shazam is the most fun superhero I have seen in a long time, maybe ever. It manages to combine the fun of a teenager suddenly having superpowers, with the seriousness of discovering the responsibility that comes with having those powers."
"3054","Anyone want to watch Shazam with me ....."
"3055","Seated ready for #SHAZAM @ODEONCinemas Swansea.

Staff here are always so nice. 

#Limitless"
"3056","@ZacharyLevi Shazam! was absolutely fantastic. Perfect distraction from all of the dark, gritty superhero movies of late"
"3057","//Watched Shazam. Not my type of movie but it was okay. There were some bits I had to close my eyes for because of bright flashes and spinning movement."
"3058","#Shazam was really good and hilarious

Zachary Levi killed it

And we are legit getting a caterpillar as the villain for the sequel"
"3059","I’ve never seen my parents enjoy a superhero movie like they did with Shazam. They’re still talking and laughing about it. <U+0001F602>"
"3060","Got a bit carried away with how good Shazam! was to fully appreciate how much of a bargain this was."
"3061","Favourite new release this week? Vote now... #Poll #UnicornStore #PetSematary #Shazam #FilmTwitter"
"3062","im having a fever and im bout to watch shazam in this real cold cinema zachary levi before health"
"3063","Since the Dark Knight* obviously"
"3064","I had so much fun watching #Shazam. Plus always liked @ZacharyLevi, and he exuded so much joy in the movie. The actors for Freddie and Darla were really good too. And a wonderful powerful villain too. I enjoyed it tremendously."
"3065","Shazam! was a fun watch last night. It's very intelligent in terms of its writing and knows exactly what it wants to be. Basically it's shows us what almost every kid would do if they became Superman. Another win for DC #ShazamMovie"
"3066","Shazam! *turns into a stud who dates your recently divorced mom and calls you ""champ""*"
"3067","It's really nice to see a dceu movie that is refreshing, hilarious, light-hearted and not dark although the first half is kinda boring. The second half is really amazing tho <U+0001F606> #Shazam"
"3068","Shazam; fun, but the monsters were duff. So many films have crap monsters. Seriously filmmakers, always come to me first #monsters"
"3069","Shazam is actually a really amazing movie! <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FE>"
"3070","Now Watching #Shazam <U+0001F60D>

Can this one be 2nd Winner i an a row for DCEU after #Aquaman ??
Let's See...."
"3071","I didn't know which one to enjoy ...Shazam learning his superpowers in a funny way<U+0001F602> or 'Don't Stop Me Now' from #Queen playing in the background <U+2665><U+FE0F>
#Shazam #ShazamMovie @ShazamMovie  @ZacharyLevi #BohemianRhapsody"
"3072","Just Watched SHAZAM! 

A couple next to me were debating if Thanos or the snap will be in this movie... ruined my entire experience.

@ZacharyLevi did an absolutely phenomenal job holy crap. I fully bought that he was a fourteen year old boy in a man's body.

Well done, DC!"
"3073","Now I have to watch this #Shazam"
"3074","@UlyssesReader Is this a review of Shazam?"
"3075","@Garry_S @jessiemaltin Maybe ‘Big’ ripped off ‘Shazam.’ One of them is what? 60+ years old?"
"3076","very nice ang shazam"
"3077","@ShazamMovie and his whole family are fast learners. It only took them a few minutes on their first outing to figure out they could fly. @WonderWomanFilm has had three outings already and she's still miserably swinging from place to place like Tarzan and Spider-Man."
"3078","Shazam: Man, this movie was just an overall fun and light hearted. Levi did amazing bringing an adult Batson to fruition and so did the rest of the cast, specifically his family. The villain was very mediocre and boring, but the movie managed to push through till the end. 9/10"
"3079","Honestly, truly"
"3080","shazam theater was full so i have to wait for the next screening which is in. 2 hours"
"3081","Just got out of #SHAZAM I liked it a lot and I'm glad I wasn't spoiled. A fun superhero movie for kids. Reminded me of Homecoming in the ending credits. Not the best movie ever, but overall enjoyable."
"3082","Good morning to all. Lesson this afternoon and off to see SHAZAM! later. New SSD hard drive and 25 key MIDI controller arriving this week so I can blow my last scoring assignments out of the water, no matter my location. Yes, even the train."
"3083","My best friend is really slow at absolutely everything, so it would be nice if he could go a bit faster. Therefore, super speed would be his power! #shazam #ShazamXbox"
"3084","Because of my surgery I have to wait almost 2 more weeks to see @ZacharyLevi in #SHAZAM ! I've waited so long. Body why do you betray me?! It's THE movie of my 2019. DC4LYFE"
"3085","Dad felt bad cuz they watched Shazam today without me so he gave me money to watch it myself <U+0001F602>"
"3086","Yall our theatre here isn't showing shazam <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"3087","im so excited to watch shazam pls leave me alone"
"3088","Ok so @ShazamMovie was a blast! Full of heart and fun... @ponysmasher did a great job with this and @ZacharyLevi did a great job bringing the wizard to life... the DCEU/Worlds of DC lives!"
"3089","How they brought the 7 Deadly Sins to life and the surprise ending transforming the foster kids was epic but the heart of the movie is what makes it better than most superhero movies! True heart. #Shazam #FamilyIsForever #DCcomics #FilmTwitter"
"3090","How they brought the 7 Deadly Sins to life and the surprise ending transforming the foster kids was epic but the heart of the movie is what makes it better than most superheroe movies! True heart. #Shazam #FamilyIsForever #DCcomics"
"3091","Honestly, they used Google...that's it and there's genuinely no reason. And, Shazam IS a cooler name! :)"
"3092","I’m back at fanboying Superman once again! Actually not really fanboying, more like embodying him, left without saying na since 5 years old talaga sobrang fan na ako, &amp; knowing na Superman Returns (2006) first one I’ve watched in the cinema &amp; lately lang nung sa Shazam!"
"3093","Might not stream today because I'm watching @ShazamMovie"
"3094","shazam just makes me so happy. it really is this large ball of goofiness but with heart and positive energy that you need in times like this."
"3095","#Shazam was surprisingly good. Didn't saw ""that"" coming in the last act. Full review later. 

PS when I saw Lotta, I screamed. And true to tradition, she should have left that door alone after all that happened in Closet Space lol @ponysmasher
 @ShazamMovie @WarnerBros_ph"
"3096","@Charalanahzard Watch Shazam! and F the haters! After a long work week, it’s exactly what I needed. First time in a while I actually lost myself in a movie."
"3097","@franklyme9 @jordanfrankham @Mr_Brell @paulpcooke @DreadSinister @EmmaKennedy @johnfreeman_DTT @scottvharrison @Soulman_Inc There is that. Plus Shazam. There was a fun article about there being about twenty or so different CMs. Not even different incarnations of the same character."
"3098","Wish my dick went Shazam and grew 2x it’s size."
"3099","Watched #Shazam today.  Without giving any spoikers...

1) It is very good movie! Packed with action and a good origin story. 

2) Don't  go watch it thinking  it as a comedy. There is some great comesy relief but it is an action movie first and foremost."
"3100","The writing's not quite as fresh as Spider-Man: Homecoming (with the same style), but Shazam! was a lot of fun with a lot of heart, both of which DC lacked up to this point.
(Also, there's a framing choice in the last 30 secs. that kinda implies some changes might be on the way.)"
"3101","SHAZAM’S LIT!!! GOD IT’S SO COOL (albeit the cliche lightning mcqueen plot) but WOW. Finally some decent dceu movie."
"3102","What movie should I go watch first,  Shazam! Or Captain Marvel?Decisions decisions"
"3103","@caseycausley @ShazamMovie They gave out ones for GLASS and AQUAMAN too but usually I forget I have them and end up leaving them in the cinema. Actually the same thing happened with this one as well but I remembered and ran back in to get it!"
"3104","@Arctichawk_ @CaptainGalxy This is the best I’ve ever seen the DCEU. I have despised the franchise forever. I walked out of Shazam amazed and stunned."
"3105","Dear @ZacharyLevi,
Just Watched The @ShazamMovie, It Was an Amazing Experience especially in 4D Cinema. Watching it felt like being in the shoes of a kid (Cause I am that age) who gets superpowers &amp; how 'he' would face his foe and protect his family was INCREDIBLE!#justsaytheword"
"3106","@KingTurnerIII @Melvingordon25 The first negative comment for Shazam that I read. I was wondering where you guys went."
"3107","@LL_CoolK You're right. I guess umuntu must just forget about it. Because even if Shazam does come to the rescue,the PITCH is normally not what I'm looking for...<U+0001F60F>"
"3108","Shazam is the best DC movie in a very, very long time."
"3109","Going to see Shazam later!"
"3110","I need to watch Shazam ASAP"
"3111","Head canon: that kid is Wally West."
"3112","Just done watching “Shazam!” and its the dopest SuperHero Movie ever with @rodelgib"

"3115","@wittertainment @KermodeMovie @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @SistersBrosFilm @LAIKAStudios @simonmayo Went with the kids last night and we all loved Shazam. Some proper laugh out loud moments and not to much to think about. Just a good fun family film."
"3116","supposed to go for a festival but ended up going to watching Shazam lmaooo"
"3117","It is and more"
"3118","@SuperSuitShow @UpToTASK @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @Burn0321 @MrNiceGuy18_58 @JamesGavsie @MTFIII @RandyS0725 @SuperiorComic16 @SuperheroPOLL Aquman was the start of the a new age for the DCEU and Shazam gave us more reasons to keep watching these movies <U+0001F60C>"
"3119","Thinking I might go see Shazam next week - only heard good things so far and I fancy a feel-good DC movie"
"3120","Hey @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi just confirming that #SHAZAM is still amazing the third time"
"3121","@ZacharyLevi you sir were incredible as Shazam!!!! I'm a big comicbook enthusiast and I absolutely loved that movie!!! Especially the last part<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"3122","Shazam is what Man of Steel should have been"
"3123","If you never tried to scream ""Shazam!"" in the street to see if you get superpowers, have you even lived?"
"3124","I liked #Shazam as a whole, but one part of the ending disappointed me very much. If you seen the movie and want me to elaborate, DMs are open"
"3125","Saw #Shazam 
DC will never learn how to make muves, its dark depressing shit again... superhero lost his parents in childhood bla bla... 
only looks fun only in trailer <U+0001F481><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"3126","shazam- unexpected Djimon Hounsou that i appreciate <U+0001F64F>"
"3127","I don't agree with this headline, especially since the lead is still a white man and Spider-Verse exists, but #Shazam shines brightest thanks to its wonderful portrayal of a diverse family that is not represented enough in superhero  films."
"3128","Seeing #Shazam in an hour! I hope after the bitter disappointments that were Captain Marvel and Us I can actually go and see a blockbuster and be surprised and/or impressed!"
"3129","very proud to have joined twitter to follow @ZacharyLevi back in ""the day"". Wonderful young man, compassionate person, an actor who you enjoy watching. heart melted seeing him on buses in london a SHAZAM. good luck man x"
"3130","Shazam , Chinese bakery and then home"
"3131","@drmoore @ShazamMovie Yes shazam best one of DC comics"
"3132","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Great movie Shazam fully fun.
I think Tobey Maguire will better for green lantern role"
"3133","£4 cinema gives me LIFEEEEEEEEE, I’m bout to spend my whole day watching Shazam &amp; whatever else there is to watch <U+0001F602>"
"3134","Not surprised"
"3135","Good morning and happy Saturday Super Friends. Who saw #Shazam! last night? What are your thoughts on it today? We hope you all loved it!

There’s plenty of time left to enter our lastest #giveaway if you haven’t already."
"3136","ShazamMovie was really good. ZacharyLevi and #markstrong kicks real ass! Mark strong is the best DCEU villain since Shannon’s Zod! This movie has heart, and is super fun. Go watch it NOW!! Shazaammm!!! #ShazamMovie #shazam2019-04-06T07:51:13.000Z"
"3137","Shazam (2019), had several laugh out loud moments while seeing the film. It was just lighthearted and fun."
"3138","Finished watching #captainmarvel , I'll be on a seat to see #shazam . That's what I'm talking about how to spend a day of weekend !!"
"3139","Enjoyed Shazam but didn't love it as much as I thought I would. Found it to be tonally uneven but the cast and sheer amount of heart mostly made up for it. I wouldn't recommend taking young kids to see it though. I took my 6yo stepson to see it and he was terrified at times."
"3140","@andi_knox @DarkNateReturns That’s often how private education works in the UK! Did Shazam eat cucumber sandwiches and drink tea in the cafeteria?"
"3141","@ZacharyLevi Went to the theatre to see the movie yesterday....the film is so so good!! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>and you were excellent as SHAZAM...<U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD>"
"3142","Literally my lil sister told me to stop playing on repeat talk fast to just use Shazam and play it her self."
"3143","#Shazam is good fun. Liked it. 
Climax is long drawn out. Otherwise fine. 
Genuinely funny at a lot of places.<U+0001F44D>
DC showing good progress."
"3144","@ScalaRadio good morning can you possibly play the theme music to the film Shazam"
"3145","did luke really record the movie screen in shazam? pleeaaaase he’s so dumb that’s illegal"
"3146","so i was ppl who made shazam goon off about the fact they have a major lgbt character,, okay first of all fucking bullshit and suck my gay toes"
"3147","Off to see #ShazamMovie"
"3148","Again I asked my friend to wake up, let’s go see Shazam and she’s talking about a child minder. Mannnn.... Look at Goku, he turned out alright"
"3149","@the_moviebob   in your Shazam review you say, ""Freddie gets to be a dick due to his disability and ""you never see that in movies, it’s refreshing!"" why did you feel necessary or unnecessary to overlook the point that actor is not disabled and how this is a now growing trend"
"3150","excuse me can you share some of your cuteness that would be greatly appreciated"
"3151","I’m so proud of DC. Their movies are improving!! SHAZAM! Is awesome. Highkey watch it <U+2728>"
"3152","Black panther &amp; Spider verse fans are triggered right now <U+0001F602>"
"3153","Shazam is not only a superhero origins film but is also a coming-of-age film and that's awesome"
"3154","Wasn't expecting the (Marvel) Shazam family so early in the DCEU"
"3155","The real captain marvel time! — watching Shazam! Movie"
"3156","this is your fave?"
"3157","@TheFoxtrot_ I went to see #Shazam 
I didn't know they were going to show a scene just telling people go see it in IMAX you get a treat"
"3158","About to see Shazam! Buzzing to see this, haven’t seen many trailers either so don’t know what to expect! <U+0001F9B8><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> what did you guys think of it? 
#ShazamMovie #shazam"
"3159","Shazam. A fun movie. Don't expect much from it other than a fun plot."
"3160","My best friend's super power would be invunerablility to everything that could destroy them. :)"
"3161","In other words #shazam is fresh, funny, exciting and has a very possitive message. It was a  9/10 film for me....if i recomend to watch it?....hell YES!!!"
"3162","#Shazam is my new fave superhero! And I got to here Queen in the movie!!! <U+0001F495>"
"3163","shazam just made me wanna live in a mark strong and zach levi sandwich pls universe quench my fuckin’ thirst"
"3164","@TerryLovesYall @GuyL_ Cinematically no. Plus the antagonist has a generic back story and motive. However, Shazam’s character was portrayed well and the movie had a good supporting cast. The characters are pretty lovable and that has a lot to do with why the movie is so enjoyable."
"3165","Counterpoint: I didn't need to see either ""Animal Farm"" nor ""The Last Unicorn"" as a kid

Still scarred by that insane nonsense"
"3166","@Spencer_Fearon @ShazamMovie Pristine white shirt and cinema snacks in a dark room don't usually end well. No doubt you were still spotless."
"3167","Ross Butler and Adam Brody's appearance is cherry on top"
"3168","#shazam is extremely hilarious! Glad that DC's mojo is finally working well both in the box office and movie reviews"
"3169","@khayadlanga I am yet to watch Shazam, but if that is the case, it will soon be overtaken by JOKER...the trailer looks brilliant."
"3170","@badbyemii Shazam chart to see what songs are hit at the moment (that week)

By Shaming the title track at least 5-10 times a day in India we can have impact of the song play on US radios."
"3171","@JaeRoar I saw it last night, I really enjoy the movie. I don't know a whole bunch about the Shazam character but overall was pretty happy with the movie."
"3172","I'm busy cleaning the yard with a lekka amapiano mix and my neighbour tells me to put louder so he can shazam.. Told him to come help me, I will shareit... Nothings for free especially good  music.. Lol..."
"3173","Battle of the Captain Marvels.  #CaptainMarvel vs. #Shazam both in the cinemas."
"3174","@TheRochaSays Saw Shazam last night n ur review, loved it. There is disconnect between them but i think it's done that way cuz I would be the same, if i was small weak, young, kept to myself, then get superpowers, it would give u that confidence be what u want 2b"
"3175","So I've heard. This reviews are insane. Itching to watch it."
"3176","Just saw Shazam! and it's absolutely delightful! It's hilarious and has heart. Congrats to @ZacharyLevi for knocking this out of the park!"
"3177","april is such a good month media wise…killing eve, game of thrones, tuca and bertie, LSD album, end game, shazam"
"3178","@_Al_Hajji I think I told u I didn't like the trailer then. This is the 2nd review I'm seeing calling it thrash<U+0001F62A>"
"3179","No 2 review<U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923>"
"3180","@thisisbankole Come all this movie spoilers please keep your opinion to yourself let others watch first haba what is all this. First it was captain marvel I don't feel like watching it again now shazam it will not work for you people"
"3181","I don't doubt this but there isn't much that isn't better than Homecoming"
"3182","apparently he’s leaving again tomorrow ugh.... homophobia"
"3183","@itinerantwizard Aquaman did try way too hard to have that ""epic"" quality like the first Thor movie did, with the classic hero's journey, but really did come off clunky like you said.

I was expecting the family aspect to Shazam, and thought that was well done."
"3184","So I’m at work and I just started listening to the @ShazamMovie soundtrack and I have to say that it makes me want to see the movie again and again! #SHAZAM @ZacharyLevi"
"3185","Just finished watching Shazam. Now that's marvelous!

Some scenes were too graphic for the kind of movie that it is though."
"3186","I would still put Wonder Woman above #Shazam but it's still a solid film. 

Pretty good CGI for a ""low budget"" film honestly."
"3187","#Shazam was a true delight. An incredibly inspired superhero tale that is filled with humour and heart. A true home run for @WBHomeEnt and @DCComics."
"3188","So #Shazam was great <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D> I have this sudden urge to break out my Chuck DVDs?
(Side note: I still hate 3D movies, even 3D IMAX, and I really resent being forced to see films in 3D)"
"3189","Gonna have to see Shazam again at some point this week"
"3190","The trailer was horriblee, what were you expecting"
"3191","It was So much fun watching SHAZAM yesterday....great movie...not surprised it has great reviews from rotten tomatoes, variety n co!!!!"
"3192","Shazam! Was entertaining. I found the ending to be one of the strongest endings in any DC film. Aquaman still takes the cake for my favorite DC film, but this is a close second."
"3193","I love you @ShazamMovie from the bottom of my heart."
"3194","Not a single dull moment watching #Shazam <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> @RossButler Looking great hey! <U+0001F60D>"
"3195","Shazam needs to work more on Dj Mixes lol!!! I’m at this wedding missing out on titles of good songs <U+0001F622><U+0001F622><U+0001F622>"
"3196","Lmao. Thanks for the review"
"3197","Shazam! is the best DC movie to date<U+26A1><U+26A1>"
"3198","I don't know why #Shazam is getting such good reviews.

This is really a movie for 14 year olds. 

 The casting of the movie is really bad except @ZacharyLevi and that kid from It. Those moments between these two guys are really fun. But mostly everything else is dull."
"3199","@StayBeautifulB I once knew a girl who, when a teenager, snogged a really good lookong guy. And once they broke it he said, ""Can you spell Shazam?!""

Not sure I can distance myself from that tale when I saw the first promos of this movie show up."
"3200","@Luiz_Fernando_J Shazam box office in China has been terrible. Beaten by a Hong Kong movie on the opening day. Most likely Shazam cannot even claim any single day box office top spot during the entire run... Audience reviews in China are very bad too. Culture difference is a big factor..."
"3201","Getting over the disappointment by having a lazy morning, brunch and then going to see @ShazamMovie!

@ZacharyLevi is amazing so I cannot wait and Grant seemed to like the trailer. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"
"3202","Had a great night at the movies yesterday! <U+0001F601>
#PetSematary is a great new take on the novel from #StephenKing
#Shazam is a light hearted superhero movie, wich is very welcomed, I needed to laugh <U+0001F64C>"
"3203","Maybe I'm wrong here, but I don't think the Shazam/Captain Marvel stuff is actually that confusing or complicated for film audiences because they just do not give a fuck that Shazam was once called Captain Marvel"
"3204","when will i be able to watch Shazam spare me uni, please"
"3205","@Pagmyst No, I was replying to you saying that Shazam is gunna be one of the best movie of the year<U+0001F602>. Endgame will give it a run for its money. Still haven’t watched Shazam so it might prove me wrong"
"3206","There's a bunch of stuff I want to talk about with Shazam, but for now I'll just say the Wizard is basically Vetruvius from the LEGO Movie except not a parody"
"3207","This is why we cant have nice things"
"3208","@tyldil204 @noyal_jacob @getFANDOM @RottenTomatoes Loved both movies but Shazam was special with it's message, goofy humour and the hillarious moments especially the board room scene"
"3209","@JimLee @ponysmasher Boardroom scene and ofc the Shazam family <U+0001F525>"
"3210","@tanyajunghans Love it, what a voice! And it even sounds familiar. Let me Shazam"
"3211","I'm either going to the 12.45 showing of shazam or I'm playing something for an hour or so then going back to sleep"
"3212","@danicious_dan @dafeakpomie @Wana____ Actually Shazam's original name was Captain marvel so yes there is a male Captain marvel"
"3213","I think your taste in cinema is just horrible"
"3214","@YuleD I preferred Aquaman and Wonder Woman more than Shazam"
"3215","Seeing this in a few hours!"
"3216","Maybe I should watch #Shazam afterall 
My mutuals can't stop praising it"
"3217","@armeddarkwolf78 Shower first then rest time I have to go see Shazam at 4"
"3218","@davidscottjaffe Captain Marvel is part of a successful franchise with a strong sense of direction.  Shazam not so much.  That isn't to say one will definitely be better than the other, I haven't yet seen Shazam, but in terms of time well spent, CM is more of an investment moving forward, imo."
"3219","Your opinion. The movie isn’t 

The ratings online says different 
Social media comments says different"
"3220","@JerryOrdway @quizwhiz @ShazamMovie I never understand the change of the name in new 52. Yes Marvel owns the trademark, for that reason DC can't use the name in covers or products. 
But inside the comic or in the movie you can call him Captain Marvel.
So Shazam should be the name of Black Adam, Mary and Freddy too"
"3221","Watching Shazam today and I’m hyped"
"3222","Looking forward to seeing @ShazamMovie again today with the girls, so I can *finally* talk about it! <U+0001F606> #Shazam"
"3223","My favorite part in Shazam is when the guy goes 'fatality'  
It's great"
"3224","Going to see Shazam today. Hopefully it makes me forget the tragedy Captain Marvel was."
"3225","@Jgrazerofficial I love you, ur so fucking talented in shazam <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"3226","Not a fan of superhero movies but hahaha Shazam was coolll<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>"
"3227","@SamHammich69 Sick, it was either this or Shazam and I got my answer <U+0001F60E>"
"3228","@JimLee @ponysmasher Most heart wrenching: Billy meeting his real mother <U+0001F61E>
Most funny: Hadouken! <U+0001F602><U+0001F605>
Most epic: the Shazam family, in its entirety
Most inside comics: Mr. Mind, the Crocodile Men, and the Monster Society of Evil."
"3229","@Bat_Cule What's wrong with John's movie crossing Shazam?"
"3230","Shazam movie review: 15/10 would still marry Zachary Levi. <U+0001F60D><U+2764><U+FE0F> I seriously laughed the whole movie, which for me means I loved it."
"3231","I’ve got IMAX tickets to see #Shazam tonight.

What plans that won’t measure up to mine do you have for this evening?"
"3232","The @TheDCUniverse is on a hot streak. #Shazam is a breath of fresh air with plenty of good performances and littered with Easter eggs. Very fun to watch, did the character deserved justice <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"3233","@ZacharyLevi I went to see it yesterday with my boys and they loved it. Great humour and action #shazam"
"3234","DC knocked it out of the park with @ShazamMovie. Zachary Levi absolutely smashes it as the title character."
"3235","Stayed up to watch 5 mins of extended footage from #GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters <U+0001F631><U+0001F631><U+0001F631><U+0001F631> that was attached to #Shazam"
"3236","Looking forward to watching ‘Shazam!’ with @ashleighjane this afternoon!

@newlinecinema @ponysmasher @JovanArmand @gracecfulton @jackdgrazer @AsherAngel @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @vuecinemas #SHAZAM"
"3237","i called my brothers and they're watching shazam at the cinema rn wow i can't relate"
"3238","It was also just so fun to see such a lighthearted romp set in the DC Universe that didn’t require any knowledge of DC Films’ versions of Superman and Batman, so it’s easy to pretend it exists in a universe that has better versions of them. #Shazam"
"3239","i haven't made an edit in like 3 months and i have so much work on right now but suddenly i have the motivation for a shazam! edit this is bad"
"3240","@waryastfu I just saw Shazam!’s ratings are high on both IMDb and rotten tomatoes, are you sure you don’t like it?"
"3241","Movies to watch this summer?

Shazam!
Captain Marvel
Avengers: EndGame
SpiderMan: Away from home
Us (thank me later)
Brightburn 
Lion king"
"3242","In case you were wondering, the @ShazamMovie was really fun to watch! Enjoyed every second of it!  Go see it! @DCComics"
"3243","Meagan Good is finessed into #Shazam ? Alllllright DC. Yal still ain’t telling a story but this joint is smooth lol definitely the best one so far"
"3244","Actually kind of looking forward to watching Shazam later. Then again I was looking forward to justice league, suicide squad, batman v superman and they were all shite."
"3245","#Shazam is definitely the movie you need to watch this weekend."
"3246","Who is going to see shazam today?"
"3247","@AJAlThani I loved the movie !! Shazam had the entire community representing Yass"
"3248","There’s a scene in #Shazam that’s a straight-up ‘this guy is a hero’ moment, and it honestly made me well up. Sometimes comic book movies forget to show their heroes actually saving people and/or telling someone everything is going to be okay - THAT is what really stays with me."
"3249","Parents are going to take their younger kids to see #Shazam and potentially be horrified, meanwhile the kid is going to have an absolute blast. It’s THAT kind of movie; one 6 year-old me would have BEGGED to see. I love it for that, family films don’t have to be squeaky clean!"
"3250","Between the excellent #Shazam, the potentially-awesome Gunn-led Suicide Squad, and how great Joker looks (Aquaman, while I didn’t like it personally, also has a ton of fans and was very successful) - it’s nice to say that DC are genuinely upping their game to compete with Marvel."
"3251","#Shazam is another good DC movie, carrying on from the excellent #Aquaman earlier! A refreshing combo of fun &amp; action all along! Keep up the good work, you might even compete against #Marvel one day <U+0001F609>"
"3252","@CryptMidwest @AMCTheatres @ShazamMovie Enjoy!!!!"
"3253","David F. Sandberg directed Lights Out and then directed Shazam... There's this weird pattern of great horror directors going onto direct great horror films."
"3254","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures Good, now when are we getting MOS2?"
"3255","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures Mand of Steel 2, when are you starting production?"
"3256","@fincherism Meanwhile Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam are the 4th, 6th, and 7th DCEU films respectively and represent women and people of color to a certain degree, but then their attempts to be more inclusive get diminished and they get compared to CM, BP, and Spider-Verse in the process."
"3257","#Shazam opens at #1 at FRI #boxoffice with $20.5M incl THU pre-shows but not incl earlier previews. Opening wknd headed to $51M neighborhood and $54M incl previews. Solid WOM may lead to good run ahead."
"3258","Good morning to everyone but people spoiling Shazam just because they don’t want to see the movie, you’re not edgy just a spiteful asshole <U+0001F92A>"
"3259","@fincherism Or read the Shazam comics that this movie is based on. <U+0001F643>"
"3260","Not sure if it’s just me but to those comparing Shazam to MCU, let me tell you something. The MCU has never produced a movie like Shazam!"
"3261","Shazam is a movie filled with heart. The comedy delivery is spot on. A wholesome family movie with a deeply touching message. Full of action with a tinge of horror. You have never seen a superhero movie like this before!
#Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"3262","The moment when Freddy throws the Batarang &amp; Billy brings Superman...whole theatre shouts out CRAZE LEVEL !!! &amp; 
@ZacharyLevi is perfect...liked end titles #SHAZAM"
"3263","Shazam and Pet Semetary today, because Takeover kept me from going last night"
"3264","If Shazam shares its DNA with any Donner film it’s not Superman, it’s The Goonies. Marshall, Dante, and Columbus’ fingerprints can also be seen on the film. But most of all, #Shazam is clearly the work of the guy who did Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation. In Sandberg we trust."
"3265","I wouldn't label Shazam as just a kids movie. It's rly for everyone because it has a good mix of everything. Like I wouldn't say the Raimi Spider-man films, the first 2 Harry Potter films, Goonies, Ghostbusters and Gremlins are all just for kids. They can definitely watch them..."
"3266","There is nothing nostalgic about Shazam you plebs
They only payed homage which is the best way ever. 
Even in the score itself, it's not nostalgic at all."
"3267","There’s one scene in Shazam that I consider to be one of the absolute best in the entire dceu.. it just got me."
"3268","Again you can't expect a kid that aspire to be a superhero(Shazam) to be an exact copy of Superman
Even superboy isn't an exact copy of Superman lol
Why should they be copies in the first place you fucking dense, each one has different characteristics."
"3269","shazam has

- diversity!
- foster families!!!!!!
- FAMILY

along with

- comedy
- family fun
- heart

and so much more. how can you not love this movie??"
"3270","Also yes each has different score
Shazam score fits the character and it's beautiful. 
Other than that,Yeah... Proceed to Fuck yourself"
"3271","Not that having multiple is implicitly a bad thing, but Shazam having one (very good) writer who gets the material working alongside a caring and committed director is absolutely reflected in how tight and focused its screenplay is in a great way. It’s kinda rare for CBMs now."
"3272","@brells_ it filmed in toronto and i just can't wait to lose it the whole movie cause TORONTO AND SHAZAM it's gonna be so awesome"
"3273","Shazam getting praised for its diversity only to be dismissed by certain sections of Twitter saying “Well the main guy is white” is the biggest dumb fuck energy I’ve seen on this website"
"3274","My biggest complaint about the DC movies was there was no joy, no fun.  Shazam is by far the most fun dc movie and filled with joy.  It’s also ironic that Captain Marvel may be the least fun Marvel movie"
"3275","The Cavill / Warner talks were allegedly for an appearance in next year’s Shazam! Would have been awesome."
"3276","@MaraWritesStuff Shazam, but to tell me why no one has ever loved me &amp; what I can do about it."
"3277","We’re going to see Shazam , i can’t figure when’s the right time to tell him, but tell him i must"
"3278","Back after watching #ShazamMovie ! Added to my favourites <U+2764><U+FE0F> It's such a wonderful hilarious entertainer from @TheDCUniverse  <U+0001F602><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F525> @ZacharyLevi , @ponysmasher ,the entire cast &amp; crew deserves all the praise <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC>"
"3279","@ponysmasher Thank you for choosing @ZacharyLevi for your lead in @ShazamMovie . I've been a huge fan of his since his time on Chuck and he is so perfect in this movie. I think I smiled the entire time I was watching. You're going to make him a star."
"3280","Watched both @ShazamMovie and @captainmarvel last night. Back to back IMAX shows. @DCComics the clear winner this time around. <U+0001F601>"
"3281","shazam has heart, fun, and love. Im soooo touched <U+0001F62D>"
"3282","@Sci_Phile the bus incident in #Shazam , was there anything not accurate about the drop, catch and impact?"
"3283","Shazam was good i love the family theme—until yui mentioned the bully bros who rode friggin ferris wheel with only the two of them—‘bro u wanna ride this with me bro’ ‘yea sure bro’"
"3284","The comments are so annoyings <U+0001F62D> leave my kids alone"
"3285","@RichardCrouse Shazam is a great movie and film here in Toronto you see a lot of Toronto in the movie I really enjoyed it<U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F37F><U+0001F37F>"
"3286","@OdyneLaFee I like it.  Unfortunately the nearest ones are 2 hours away so it’s not often I go.   I usually sit at the bar and get appetizers.  When a good tune comes on, I run into the back hall and Shazam it! <U+0001F606>"
"3287","<U+2728><U+2728> SUPER URGENT <U+2728><U+2728>

Anyone wanting 2 pair of ticket to Shazam Movie at Subang Parade at 10 o’clock, kindly dm me. 

I’ll be there too, my friends cant make it on time, so im reselling the ticket. 

Rt or nothing will happen to you."
"3288","@Supreme_Khai_ It’s not. Shazam arguably the most diverse superhero movie of all time"
"3289","yall gonna have to explain how Into The Spiderverse is more diverse than Shazam...please lol"
"3290","Just watched Shazam and I notice a mistranslation. Pretty sure Freddy said ""selfies"", not ""selfish"""
"3291","Never thought DC will make this type of movies. shazam is <U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C>"
"3292","@AuthorTOBurnett Right? I have trouble with Shazam being over the top silly. Even if it’s “origin story,” I think Shazam should come across more powerful and mature!"
"3293","Anyway, great book 9.5 out of 10. All the fun of a DC Comics Presents team up but with more room for the nuances and deeper themes. I love it. Seeing Shazam in 3 hours :)"
"3294","People replying to this with “b-b-but Spiderverse” need to chill out"
"3295","@glenn_matchett @TreeBeerd The logistical issue is that Shazam literally doesn't work as a codename. 

He can't say his codename in-universe without turning into Billy Batson! <U+0001F923>"
"3296","Really enjoyed Shazam. Hopefully there’s more."
"3297","@I_Am_MFR Another situation I am awaiting your thoughts and opinions of considering Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia are two of the executive producers of ""Shazam"" with Dany Garcia being Henry Cavill's manager.  Complicated situation."
"3298","@TomTeachesGames Cool... my wife and I loved Levi in Chuck... maybe we’ll check out Shazam! Thanks for review"
"3299","$29.2M intl FRI for #Shazam led by $15.3M opening day from China on a holiday. Intl #boxoffice cume at $44M thru FRI. China SAT dropping down to $10M area. Global opening wknd trying to reach $140M vicinity."
"3300","@I_Am_MFR @TheRock But there is a certain scene in #Shazam we cannot talk of yet that references future confrontations early in the movie when Billy meets the Wizard. With visuals."
"3301","Anyways...have a fun Saturday, go out, break someone's heart and hole. And make sure to watch #Shazam"
"3302","Some of you are so triggered over this, but you need to first figure out what diversity really means."
"3303","@ZacharyLevi Saw #SHAZAM and loved it! We need to see so much more of you! <U+2665><U+FE0F><U+2665><U+FE0F><U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"3304","good morning, have you seen SHAZAM! yet? if you don’t, please see it. if you have, please see it, again and again. <U+263A><U+FE0F>"
"3305","@YoungHind @wbpictures @WBHomeEnt @ShazamMovie is example that @wbpictures want to copy Marvel movies. I think Aquaman was the last epic movie. #Shazam is like the first Harry Potter movies. General audience and kids will enjoy it for sure. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"3306","Better than BvS and Superman and any recent DC movie other than Christopher Nolan's Batman"
"3307","Shazam! tried to be too many things at once, failing at all of them. It wanted to be DC's Deadpool, but its jokes were more spoof than smart commentary. It wanted to be like Big, but the boardroom scenes showed otherwise. 

Marketed as a PG13 kids movie, but had a swearing Santa."
"3308","Saw @ShazamMovie last night.  It was perfect!  What I've been hoping for a DC film.  Just the right amount of humor and seriousness with a whole lot of heart. The cast did a great job, and loved @ZacharyLevi who had to play a kid trapped in a man's body with superpowers."
"3309","// Will be on and off randomly today. Going to see Shazam later."
"3310","@sokrafood @_PVRCinemas @Avengers @ShazamMovie @wbpictures @MarvelStudios @Marvel @warnerbrosindia @Disney @disneyfilmindia @Marvel_India Using recording devices in a cinema ghar is a punishible offence under section 63 of the copyright act <U+0001F61B>"
"3311","When are we able to tweet about the Shazam movie?"
"3312","#Shazam was the cutest superhero movie I have ever watched. <U+0001F60D>

There was a twised no one expected....."
"3313","Continuing his rich history of being completely wrong."
"3314","@RICHARDLNEWBY The real breakout star of Shazam is Sandberg"
"3315","just watched shazam and i don't understand why critics liked it more than aquaman"
"3316","Out of all the posts I’ve read about Shazam “Billy Batson said fuck cops” has got to be the funniest"
"3317","@Joe_Gatto @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Going Tuesday, cant wait"
"3318","@FOX10Phoenix Shazam is not about a kid who magically turns into a adult superhero version of himself. Your movie critic is horrendous!! #PhoenixGetAClue"
"3319","Despite a bit of a sore thumb in the villain, (even with a good performance from Mark Strong) SHAZAM! is phenomenal, and the best reminder of what we love so much about many superhero stories and characters. You’ll want to see it again immediately after it’s over."
"3320","I now owe an apology to ANOTHER DCEU director, Mr. David F. Sandberg. I know I’m moviegoer 14,000,605 to say this, but my oh my, SHAZAM! is an absolute joy. Easily the most fun I’ve had at the movies all year, and uncompromisingly the best DCEU flick to date."
"3321","the fact that the opening instrumental of niall horan’s slow hands played during shazam just made the movie that much better"
"3322","@Steele131 If this were MCU they would just go on about how Shazam is a ""palate cleanser"" for the big budget movie Aquaman. <U+0001F602>"
"3323","I actually really enjoyed #Shazam! It was everything it was suppose to be. A stand alone origin movie that was fun and had a solid story. It's def something worth watching in theaters."
"3324","@ZacharyLevi @WarnerBrosEnt @DCComics #Shazam is set in Philly?! Why didn’t y’all film here? I could be your location scout if you honestly need it. I’m glad of the superhero being in my town though. That’s so exciting! Eff metropolis, we got Shazam!"
"3325","@Shazam @Imaginedragons @AppleMusic Thunder feel thunder lightning and the thunder"
"3326","Billy being unable to pee in his #Shazam persona should be an ongoing thing they dramatically solve in the third film. <U+0001F602>"
"3327","@ZacharyLevi Hi @ZacharyLevi just watched #Shazam and really enjoyed it. Was also so happy and psyched for the one you invited for lunch. ;)"
"3328","Wow! #SHAZAM was dope! Fun and a bit emotional. Loved the surprise at the end. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"

"3333","Today I watched the #shazam and I didn't think it would be so perfect, and that there would be such an unpredictable ending. @AsherAngel proud of you"
"3334","I’ve heard nothing but amazing things about @ponysmasher’s @ShazamMovie — and I’m not surprised. Can’t wait to check it out <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"3335","“sunny superhero flick” is my Spring mood 

(crdt: NYT article abt Shazam 4/3/19)"
"3336","@GraceRandolph I am all about DC and this movie looks great but the one person in it that makes me want to rush out and see Shazam is Jerry from The Walking Dead ...love that guy"
"3337","@GraceRandolph I am a image and DC fan although I find Shazam to be an okay character I haven't had a lot of interest to see this movie the one person I found out who's in this movie that is going to make me go see it is Cooper ""Jerry"" Andrews from The Walking Dead @smugorange love that dude"
"3338","Shazam was pretty good...DCEU is going in the right direction"
"3339","@daamiedwards For the sake of being fair and compromise. I would be willing to have movies like Shazam if we can also get movies Zack was doing. Hatred from both sides would end if we could just get balance like that. I am NOT supporting mcu 2.0."
"3340","@atomtickets I received the email for 3 for $20 Shazam and for 3 days I've been trying and doesn't work!"
"3341","Friends,

@ShazamMovie comes out today!

The star @ZacharyLevi has said nice things about my film @circmovie.

I met him in person. He is a good guy.

It looks like a fun movie you can bring the whole family to.

Please go see it! #ShazamMovie"
"3342","Shazam
Great fun with plenty of laughs. Obvious parallels to Superman &amp; Big but hints of Kick Ass/Spiderman Homecoming too.
Really enjoyed it"
"3343","SHAZAM WAS SO GOOD, i hate the real mother, i love the new mother and father and DARLA YU SHO CUTEEE, and yeah the power rangers hahah NAISEEEEE

GOOOOOOoooooooodddDDDDD<U+26A1>"
"3344","Comic lover this movie is a paradise which has all the best ingredients to call it one of the best dc movie.After Aquaman, Shazam movie sets another benchmark for @warnerbrosme that their is alot of dc characters if put to right use you can make a good movie. My rating 8.5/10"
"3345","Watched #Shazam with @ZacharyLevi this weekend in Israel, lots of fun and a great story of redemption!

Now eagerly waiting for #UnplannedTheMovie @UnplannedMovie to also be released here!"
"3346","@tunante_ato_1 @Sideways440 When I heard that they were making a Shazam movie, I think the absurdity of the reality in which we currently reside prevented me from taking this movie seriously"
"3347","@suunymaxi @BlackMajikMan90 @breatheonmebrit @BORReport @wbpictures @ShazamMovie Nah two days already still haven’t topped the box office in China. Only got 6.8 on Douban which is really bad."
"3348","Not here for white boys claiming that Shazam is a thousand times more uplifting than any superhero film in the history of ever because, first, hyperbole, and second, Wonder Woman."
"3349","NB: not saying that you can't find Shazam uplifting. Just cool it on the hyperbole and also maybe consider the non-white boys who might feel marginalized, again, by the reinforcement of gendered and racial norms that have elevated white men's narratives for centuries."
"3350","And yes, @ZacharyLevi is definitely The Chosen One. He's perfect for the role. #SHAZAM"
"3351","what"
"3352","Last minute decision,  at the time square AMC watching Shazam, as I came too early and need to kill 3 hours"
"3353","Going to see Shazam tonight! I am super excited, I hope the movie entertains as much as people are saying. #Shazam"
"3354","Shazam! got 7.8/10 audience score on Maoyan ticket site. It's lower than Batman v Superman(8.0/10), Homecoming(8.2/10), Black Panther(8.4/10). Once Upon a Deadpool was the only superhero film that didn't reach 8.0/10 before. #Shazam"
"3355","Just got back from watching #Shazam and loved it. Genuinely funny and earnest while still poking fun at itself and the genre. Works excellently as a stand-alone film, but also as a much needed reboot for the DC cinematic universe. Superheroes can be corny AND fun! <U+0001F601>"
"3356","Quick reminder that my review of #Shazam goes up at 9:00pm (Eastern) and 6:00pm (Pacific)."
"3357","My review of #Shazam will go up in 10 hours."
"3358","Man how did DC go from giving us Wonder Woman and Aquaman, to Shazam? That movie was TERRIBLE. Arguably the worst superhero movie I’ve seen... and Green Lantern exist."
"3359","This episode also has details on how YOU can win a copy of the B:TAS inspired card game, “Almost Got ‘Im” for FREE! #DCAU #Batman"
"3360","Seeing Shazam and we got the X-men movie twice. That’s never happened."
"3361","Shazam was just a fun movie, I really recommend it for kids and adults. #Shazam"
"3362","@jowrotethis I like everything you do, Joanna, but I think you're being kind of dismissive here. Yeah, Shazam was fun, but there's a lot of good themes about appreciating the family that appreciates you. I loved both movies."
"3363","@reggiegotlag @SamParkerMetal And gave garbage like captain marvel a 5/5 .. meanwhile gave Shazam, the movie that does what the Mcu tries to do but does it way better a 1 and 1/2
We have our answer"
"3364","@ponysmasher congratufreakinglations that's a word now.. anyway on Shazam! Freaking amazing movie. Think I'll see it again. But also for that special scene.. IS IT HIM!?!?!"
"3365","Some of the replies ffs. When a movie lack of diversity, everyone is raging. And when there are finally two movies represented it, all of u too busy comparing. Stop that and spread the positivity instead of bashing one another between which one you think was the better universe."
"3366","@the_snarkmaster @SHAAN87989064 @MrRighTNoW_818 @GiteshPandya if you're going by that argument #shazam beats captian mary sue critic ratings.  and the movie didn't need the RT help deleting all the negative reviews."

"3369","Shazam! grossed an estimated $29.2M internationally on Friday.  International total stands at $44.0M, global total stands at $67.8M.

#Shazam  #BoxOffice  @wbpictures  @newlinecinema  @ShazamMovie"
"3370","Shazam! is far from my favorite of the DCEU, but it's wholesome, hilarious, and overwhelmingly delightful - but also quite dark? For a superhero action/comedy, it's surprisingly nuanced in tone."
"3371","Why YES, there will be a @ROBSERVATIONS2 this afternoon at 4:00 PM PST...and it’s gonna’ be a doozy. There’s a lot on my mind, including SHAZAM, STAR TREK, viewer mail and Verisimilitude...join the #PostGeekSingularity and add your voice to the conversation! @TBurnettwork"
"3372","@REDLECTROID Funny thing...last night, I went to see SHAZAM! at the Cinerama Dome and ran into HEATHERS screenwriter Daniel Waters. We briefly chatted about this article, which he really enjoyed, in a very ironic way. A reminder of why I still love living in LA so much."
"3373","@amazonheroicon Shazam will do well considering it’s budget that’s for sure"
"3374","Ironically, WB/DC is poised to succeed by expanding upon a principle that Marvel Studios was forced to explore. They had to use their more ""unique(and obscure) characters, but they took it down the ""TV"" path. It worked, but now DC can use theirs to go down a brand new path."
"3375","@ZacharyLevi was told last night that #Shazam might best The Dark Knight as the best DC movie. So hyped to see the movie. Follow-up success should be Chuck Movie <U+0001F601>"
"3376","Get ready for a Plastic Man movie.  For the love of God."
"3377","Shazam is a 5.
Feels cheap, like a netflix movie. Pretty slow and anticlimactic ending. Shit villain. Shazam actor still puts on a pretty good performance. Everyone else just sucks. Entertaining enough."
"3378","It's our(Indian Armys) first CB for to chart on Sp*tify.
Help anyone who is confused about Sp*tify, educate and motivate FB, IG, WP armys.

"3391","They were never trying to be Marvel. There is literally NOTHING Marvelesqu about Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. Wonder Woman is the most like a Marvel film, and even that’s a stretch. And Josstice Leage isn’t a DCEU film. It’s an abomination"

"3394","Shazam is nice it's whole lot different compared to other dc movie's"
"3395","WHY HEAVEN TREATING ME LIKE THIS <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>

I don't even have a single spare time to watch shazam, when I had, I get sick and bedrest for 2 days and still counting (which I hope not)

MEANWHILE . . . . she just watched it twice like DANGGGGGG why on earth this tortures exist <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"3396","I think it's more indicative that they want these movies to be fun and entertaining."
"3397","Shazam's presence in the Justice League would probably boost it. But it would be... weird and feel disjointed. Which is the problem. And not one that had to happen."
"3398","@DaisyLewd //I honestly get that feeling too, like some days I want to rp, while other days I wish I had someone to just hit it off and talk about random stuff, like... I DUNNO YUGIOH DUEL LINKS? SHAZAM? BRICK’S EPIC SAX SOLO? You get the picture. I wish we had more people like that..."
"3399","@Borys_Kit @THR That’s really good for #Shazam HELL YEAH!! Bye looking $65-$70m opening on par with Aquaman! Word of mouth will be Strong <U+0001F4AA>FANTASTIC MOVIE"

"3401","Oh and Shazam was very very entertaining as hell <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923> everyone, and not just comic book fans, should go watch Shazam!! 10/10 Recommended"

"3404","Toxic Femininity was displayed in Shazam as well. It was probably the most uncampy realistic part of the film."
"3405","The focus on “Family” is something I do appreciate about, Shazam. In that aspect it reminded me a lot of After Earth, and YES that movie delivered that message very well in my opinion."
"3406","@jossyukam @og_rvku  are u thinking what am thinking??"
"3407","@Porycone Also if you like Shazam I recommend Young Justice, he's featured a lot in it"
"3408","Seeing @ShazamMovie today. Super excited. Love seeing DC characters on the screen, especially when it’s not the usual suspects (I’m looking at you Batman!). Hope my bladder behaves. Doing the pee-pee dance towards the end of a movie is the worst."

"3418","anyway everyone should go watch Shazam!!! it's finally a worthy DC movie that I can brag in front of my friends!!! I am so pleased with how many comics reference brought up in the movie! 

Now let's wait for Joker!!!"
"3419","@IHEARTMKAYE @YoSoyDiego_91 Shazam wanted to be way too light hearted and playful. There weren't any serious tones to the movie at all. Aquaman had it's flaws.. one was it seems like they cut key scenes that helped the story progress. Even the most serious scene for Billy batson didn't really move me"
"3420","This is priceless. @Disney may have ""best PR in the industry"" &amp; @Marvel CBMs may make billions, but where is the pop culture references? The passion? The emotional footprint? Thank you @KurtBusiek for proving ""some things money can't buy""

good job @ZacharyLevi my expectations were met and very much exceeded, even my friends who don’t like superhero movies loved it"
"3422","Just got home from seeing #Shazam, I enjoyed it while watching and the more I think about it, the more I love it. There was so much heart to it in a really genuine way. It gave me the same feeling I got from Into the Spiderverse- anyone can be a hero. You find it, in your heart."
"3423","Shazam and Pet cemetery are getting good reviews! I want to go watch them!"
"3424","Shazam is soooo entertaining omg. Funny as hell. And honestly interesting"

"3430","I mean no disrespect to people who think that MOS and BvS are the perfect embodiment of comic book movies but if WB would have released DC films as likable as Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Shazam in the first place they would be ruling the roost. They would have trust in their brand."
"3431","Yeah, China not liking the film isn't surprising."
"3432","@ScottMendelson Stupidly people see animation as a kids only arena here in the states so it's a waste of money to market animation to adults unless it's like Imcredibles 2 or something. Shazam is a PG 13 rated live action Superhero film. It just feels like NL/WB left some money on the table."
"3433","I don't usually watch DC films now but Shazam is also worth the watch. If you'd spare a time and watch it, you'd truly know Shazam is NOT JUST A SUPERHERO hehe to all DC fanatics and to everyone who already watched the movie, you know what I mean <U+0001F602>"
"3434","I'm NqanaweLIVE and I approve of this message."

"3439","@joeandthejuice always plays the best playlists on @SpotifyUK only came to get a pick me up, end up staying for 30mins using @Shazam #tunes #joeandthejuice"
"3440","Compare that to the move Shazam, where there is a male assistant at the big corporate office, and the monsters who eat the evil rich CEOs eat several women along with men. (Sorry spoiler alert?)Women are portrayed as cops, social workers, mothers, and CEOs."
"3441","(Zachary Levi is delightful in Shazam, btw). Watching the Thomas Crown Affair, it struck me that this is the world my father and men like him lived. Big corporate worlds where women were represented only as secretaries, not as equals to men."
"3442","@BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie 60M opening please"
"3443","shazam but for when you see someone you know at a bar but you can’t remember their name for sure"
"3444","@GraceRandolph @shield1991 I think Antman is the best comparison. It's family friendly smaller scale lighthearted comedy. No one expects Antman to make big league numbers, so nobody should expect Shazam to make WW or Aquaman number. Watching it today. As long as it's good, it's what matters to the DC brand"
"3445","Shazam was an amazingly fun movie from being to end. I highly recommend checking it out. I laughed all the way through and the movie didn't take itself too seriously which was the best part."
"3446","I think I’ll watch Shazam tonight, out of boredom."
"3447","This really is a great series, if you want to read a good Shazam story, I think it's on sale on Comixology"
"3448","@_JasonWallace @August_Prince @happynnappy13 Well i was going to give Yal my opinion about Shazam .. but I fell asleep in the movies <U+0001F92F>"
"3449","@BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie I expected more but still it's not bad."
"3450","@thatfilmguy2000 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie I mean it can go near $165M but $150M is good."
"3451","@BlackMajikMan90 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie I'm not saying it's underperforming or anything. I know $55M is nice but with those good reviews i personally wanted it to score $60M+."
"3452","@NeilShelat6 @ShazamMovie No really"
"3453","@JMDeMatteis I’d watch this, too! Would be cool if WB has the rights and can release it as an extra when Shazam! hits home video."
"3454","I’m a fan of Shazam through the first 40 minutes. I’m gonna stop tweeting now"
"3455","That diversity started in the #SHAZAM New 52 #comic. It's one of the reasons I say some of @geoffjohns #DCComics stories are iconic especially, #Aquaman. Now they're immortalized on film."
"3456","I wanted to go and watch Shazam but then remembered i’m in Germany and don’t speak German"
"3457","I just finished watching shazam and honestly.... yall are gonna be mad at me but, the overall feel of the movie wouldve been better if it was animated <U+0001F614>"
"3458","I want to watch Shazam so I ask a friend of mine to watch it with me since I know he likes superhero movies (and he has a motorbike lmao) and he says ""I'm a Marvel guy"" and he goes on this long rant about how DC isn't as good as Marvel while I'm like ""???"""

Considering it was projected to do 45 million I said that's an incredible feat."
"3466","We could see 60 million this weekend.

#Shazam"
"3467","Oh man ! You got to see #SHAZAM . One of the best . Balance between horror and comedy is completely on point. Plus end credits roll is just awesome."

"3471","Shazam is pretty good.

I like it that the movie adapted the 2013's New 52 story by Geoff Johns and improve it to be more children power fantasy.

A bit of minor unresolved conflict here and there, but yea the movie is pretty good."
"3472","if you don’t think shazam is diverse, but think sm homecoming was, you have worms for brains"
"3473","The songs that I Shazam are the ones my soul connects with straight away... or I’ve been hearing them over and over again and I don’t know who the phuck sang it. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"3474","me: why am i about to watch shazam? 
shazam: *begins* 
me: billy is mY SON!!! if anything happens to him, i'll kill everyone in this room and then myself"
"3475","This is actually pretty cool yo"
"3476","#shazam skews more Donner than Snyder. I NEVER wanted to take the kids in my family to a Snyder movie. These are superhero movies after all. And how can you have a company in this modern era that has Superman and Batman, but you can't make a billion dollar movie with them in it?"
"3477","#Shazam was silly, but it was one of the best DCEU movies released so far."
"3478","My best friend's superpower would be superhuman sense of smell to find missing people. Thanks for the chance to win! @GoRixter"
"3479","#Shazam has dethroned Wonder Woman as best DC movie! Sad to say, but it’s true!!!"
"3480","It's kinda weird and a little iffy IMO that you can tell a Geoff Johns influenced DC film/TV show by how much of it is based on his comics work/the Nu 52. Shazam, Wonder Woman, Flash, anything Green Lantern. There's other parts of the DCU to use, other creators."

"3483","He bulletproof tho"
"3484","@ShazamMovie Just saw the movie!! Loved it! But Billy needs to be called Captain Marvel. Its really getting ridiculous.He needs an actual alias since he cant even refer to himself as 'shazam' without changing back. On account of principle Billy was Cap Marvel 1st."
"3485","Shazam is the first superhero movie I’ve actually wanted to see"
"3486","I actually enjoyed Shazam more than I did, Captain Marvel. <U+0001F61B><U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FB>"

"3488","@JayGDesign watching shazam unfortunately"
"3489","Gotta see this. It was the best DC movie since the dark knight trilogy. Really looking forward to DCCU if they can get the ball rolling"
"3490","Shazam;

Personally, 8/10

There are 2 after credit scenes. Don't leave early!"
"3491","@JolinTsai130 Man, apparently neither Marvel nor DC fans understand how the BO needs to work for a film whose budget barely topped 100 million.  Shazam doesn’t need to do all that much to turn a profit you guys, so it’s hardly “flopping.”"
"3492","SHAZAM! is terrific! It has a unique energy that takes a moment to vibe with; it has the heart of a mid-90s magical kids adventure (like THE WITCHES or JUMANJI) &amp; a sharp mind firmly aware of the evolution of PG-13 franchise blockbusters of the past 20 years. Sooo much fun!"
"3493","@PlatinumEquinox yeah Shazam is a perfect 10 for me."
"3494","Yeah I'm at the local theater at 10:30 in the morning to watch #Shazam ... don't judge me."
"3495","So I watched #Shazam and it was cool. It had a different approach in my opinion since Shazam is literally a teenager but it fits well with the movie."
"3496","Watched Shazam! today and its super cool, super funny and super heroes galore! I'm already theorising whether Shazam can beat other Supes like Flash or Superman because of his various abilities. I swear no spoilers, I like this to be a spoiler free tweet."
"3497","#shazam is gonna make a good amount of money .. it’s only 10 am &amp; it’s a packed theater"

"3501","@ZacharyLevi Saw it today, and just want to say thank you. What a good movie on so many levels. Real fun and  entertaining - to me at least its probably one of the best super hero movies to date. Thanks to everyone who made this happen. #Shazam"

"3503","@ShazamMovie is hands-down the BEST movie in the @TheDCUniverse !! Absolutely loved it <U+0001F329>"

"3505","Good morning beautiful people. I see SHAZAM! in IMAX tonight"
"3506","My mom refuses to go see shazam, so we going <U+2708> sad boi hours"
"3507","Shazam! was a very good movie. Definitely feels like a superhero movie done very well. Witty, funny, charming. DC might actually start getting me to see their movies again with stuff like this."
"3508","So Shazam has the same plot as Big but superhero version?"
"3509","@TheChewDefense @jrosaIes13 What a strange year. Shazam is coming out the same year a reverse Big is being released. Little"
"3510","I feel so superior seeing all these normies going to watch shazam instead of boku no hero..."
"3511","I think shazam is suitable for children cause this movie portraying a superhero but also portraying it from kids point of view and also more focused into family relationship, friendship, and loneliness that might be faced by many children..

But i think the problem kinda weak"
"3512","This cute boys!!!"
"3513","For real........."
"3514","Off to see #Shazam"

"3517","I'll be seeing it today!"
"3518","When no one was looking he bolted out the door and yelled out SHAZAM! before poofing into Captain Sparklefingers Jr. and flying off to be with the heroes. His people! His idols!"
"3519","DC fucked up, they made SHAZAM a comedy/joke movie. The character “Captain Marvel” list its title to Marvel. Captain Marvel is a Character stronger than Superman but played as a joke in the movie. Sad. Marcel’s Captain Marvel is more lighthearted but very powerful"
"3520","Fawcett Central, the fictitious school.  Named after Captain Marvel/Shazam! creator.  Clever.  #Shazam"
"3521","Is it weird that I want to be sandwiched by the men of Shazam?"
"3522","Now, I'm probably gonna say ""Shazam!"" randomly throughout the day. #Shazam"
"3523","Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed #CaptainMarvel, but I honestly think I am much more excited to see #Shazam. Maybe it's just because I love @ZacharyLevi so much. Or maybe it's because this movie looks so entertaining. Either way, I'm super excited to see this today!"

"3533","Forgot to give my honest review, for an Origin movie, Shazam was good but not great. I wish they had more action scenes but that's just the nitpicky in me. I like the overall story/setup and direction of the film and thought it was well put together."

"3562","Ok Should I Just Watch All The Holy Trilogy After I See Shazam"
"3563","@Luiz_Fernando_J @jxsticeleagues Rampage made 428m, Ant-man 519m, so Shazam! would be around 500m I think"
"3564","Shazam! is the purest superhero movie I’ve seen in a long time. I loved every moment of it and it’s approach to the magic side of the DC Universe."
"3565","Just now realizing the movie Shazam isn’t a remake of Shaquille O’Neal’s Kazaam. This isn’t a joke tweet."
"3566","Shazam did everything right"
"3567","#Shazam is really great. As an adopted child I can relate to his longing to find his mother and really liked that they didn’t redeem her."
"3568","I’m waiting outside near the theater’s ticket booth, listening to some people buy tickets for “Captain Marvel” and others buy them for “Shazam.” What a world."
"3569","Now I’m confused"
"3570","@melhoudart @JoshMom96 I retweeted this a little while ago.  I think it's safe to say it's passed $40M. <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"3571","Having now seen #Shazam I completely understand the obsession with Ross Butler. I'm sorry I'm so late to the party because he is awesome and may have made my heart skip a beat!"
"3572","@TheDenofNerds I'm the opposite, I think #CaptainMarvel was very bland and paint-by-numbers, while #Shazam was more fresh and entertaining."
"3573","I’m so glad Shazam is successful :”) it’s what they deserve"
"3574","@dayanno96 I bet, it seems right up my alley, despite not being too knowledgeable of Shazam at all. Funny enough, the only DCEU movie I've seen was Suicide Squad, I had to watch one of them at least lol."
"3575","I want to see this!"
"3576","@ZacharyLevi I have seen #ShazamMovie and will be going to see it again.  I loved it!"
"3577","Time for #Shazam I guess it's the child in all of us that's made this movie so anticipated! #DCUNIVERSE @ZacharyLevi"

This is gonna be a great morning"

"3585","I seriously just asked Google if Walgreens is pet friendly. 

We're going to see Shazam later today. Can I bring her with me to the movies?"
"3586","Shazam was excellent//DC actually has been making some good movies lately #MEHARRY_RYS19"

"3590","@ZourenIf @BlackMajikMan90 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie Many #marvel fans will not c it Bc it’s DC that’s where ur discrepancy is for box office numbers . Sadly"
"3591","@ZainAqsa3 @ZourenIf @BlackMajikMan90 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie Correct me too .. I prefer DC Bc I relate better to the characters . But winter soldier was one of my 5 best movies I’ve ever seen . Still Wonder Woman was my favorite tho <U+0001F44A>"
"3592","@thatfilmguy2000 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie They r saying 145 m which is good considering the budget was 85m"

"3594","Who wants to see Shazam ?"
"3595","Shazam is just pretty fucking amazing haha I love it"
"3596","#nw Shazam. When the cinema is just across your house lol. So convenient !"
"3597","@fuccbatman @272715021 @Sambeet_M @breatheonmebrit Only Shazam movies they’ll prob make going forward is with The Rock in it so yeah they’ll need to up that budget a bit ... even tho that 80-90M is a lie. WB trying to save face."
"3598","Realized that #Shazam is essentially @shekharkapur’s #MrIndia without the invisibility. #mindblown"
"3599","So, 
I've been writing Asher (@sonofjody) for as long as I can remember. 
And, Shazam is out.
Suddenly Asher has many many friends. 
And, he got twinnie. 
And there actually is a writer who agreed shipping Jack with him!?? Wow. I actually can't even say-"
"3600","#ShazamMovie was cool. Much better than Deadpool 2. It was fun, entertaining and it has a feel good spirit. <U+0001F44D>"
"3601","I'm about to watch Shazam and I'm HYPED! I'm excited to experience the movie that @DamienHaas got to watch"
"3602","@ZacharyLevi Taking the boys today! I'm excited that one of my favorite superheroes is finally hitting the big screen #ShazamMovie"
"3603","Such a humble way of entering her first and last year of the teens <U+0001F605><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"3604","Without any spoilers, the context makes this scene amazing! #shazam"
"3605","@GiteshPandya Solid number for #Shazam! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE> Should end up around 150m-175m at the North America box office. Should have good legs judging by Its A CinemaScore. 

Worldwide box office I’m thinking 500m or close to it. Of course would love it to do more cause it deserves it. Great movie <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"3606","@dakotalanthimos is there at least one epic fortnite dance in shazam"
"3607","@Dorv Hi Ivey, great question! A-List will only allow for three reservations at a time, regardless of the film week. You should be able to continue reserving tickets for this week after your showtime of Shazam! begins. -Mariah"
"3608","@wesleywhite626 I’ve heard good things about Shazam so far! Excited to watch it tomorrow"
"3609","This weekend kicks off an impressive month for entertainment:

April 5 -- Shazam!, Pet Sementary, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Season 1 Part 2, Unicorn Store

April 12 -- Hellboy

April 14 -- Game of Thrones

April 26 -- Avengers: Endgame

What a time to be alive."
"3610","Spoler free Shazam review: pretty good. Not wild about Zachary Levi as adult Billy but on the whole he gave a good performance that didn’t take away too much from the film. But otherwise pretty good.

And John Glover continues his tradition of the asshole dad of the antagonists"
"3611","About to watch Adam Brody in #Shazam ,this is happening for real now."
"3612","I think if #Shazam gets a trilogy the second movie will be with Mister Mind and the third will be Black Adam"
"3613","Shazam was a 12/10 for me. I loved every minute of it!!"
"3614","Come on #Shazam <U+0001F64F>

Gonna see Pet Sematary today not expecting it to be good tho"
"3615","You need to watch more superhero movies."
"3616","@ScottMendelson Some people said that Shazam is bombing overseas. Especially in China after its first day, and it’s gross in all the other countries. Is that true?"
"3617","Heading out to see Shazam aaaaaye!"
"3618","Because DC actually cares about diversity <U+0001F438><U+2615><U+FE0F>"
"3619","Another great film by every YouTube Filmmakers hero @ponysmasher 
#ShazamMovie was a fun ride throughout that tugged at the heartstrings."
"3620","shazam was more than worth seeing and i’m not saying this only because one of my favorite actors was in it tho i am proud as hell of u @Jgrazerofficial!
but for real, shazam had a great storyline and it made me and my friend laugh so hard"
"3621","@mickthestick6 @ShazamMovie @680TheFan Sorry. I’ll run my tweets by you in the future.  @680TheFan"
"3622","anyway, shazam was EXCELLENT. it had great performances and chemistry (i love u zach levi, jack dyLAN GRAZER, adam brody, and my eternal villain bae mark strong), hilarious jokes, and that genuinely developed childlike wonder grounded in familial love. let’s go, dceu! <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FC><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"3623","i guess some people in the replies don't know what diversity means"
"3624","@steve49914 Shazam! Is inconsistent fun with a slightly above average message. Plus DC doing less of a connected universe is going to do wonders for them.

So just relax and enjoy it and don't think about Thanos or Joaquin."
"3625","@Mikesul33830663 @ZourenIf @BlackMajikMan90 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie I'm both fan Marvel &amp; DC and I will see movie everything about Marvel &amp; DC, I'm enjoying both of them"
"3626","Looks like there might be a sequel for @ShazamMovie with Mr.Mind and Dr.Sivanna teaming up. But is there any possibility for Black Adam??? #Shazam #ShazamMovie #Shazam Box office #ShazamFamily #AvengersEndgame"
"3627","love #Shazam for the ""what? we are one family. who cares about looks."" attitude
the diversity is just there, a part of life, a part of the love they all share
its beautiful and if you want to dismiss that because the lead (KID!) is white then yeah, I dont care&amp;bye"
"3628","cuando vea shazam is over for you bitches"
"3629","Ugh we stan a diverse cast"
"3630","@sassypants3 I still can't move on from Shazam! Especially the fight scene and the ending. <U+0001F606>"
"3631","Not many movies can make a 38-year old father of four go ""Whoa!"" out loud in the cinema. #Shazam made me go ""WHOA!"" TWICE! It's enjoyable, funny with a warm story at heart. There are some flat spots and DC movies still need to work on their set pieces but overall I enjoyed it."
"3632","@ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Saw it last night and it was pure fun! All about family and has a genuine heart of gold! Darla steals the show! <U+0001F609><U+0001F61C>"
"3633","@bassmentinc2004 Leaning Shazam...."
"3634","@christarride @scottfrilot @thunder_punt None of this has anything to do with Shazam being terrible."
"3635","@christarride @scottfrilot @thunder_punt Everything you hate about Star Trek and other big budget movies is all Shazam is. It's empty and one dimensional and 99% of the time makes no logical sense. It's paint by numbers cliche."
"3636","@christarride @scottfrilot @thunder_punt This convo has derailed. Y'all see Shazam and then let's fight."
"3637","There needs to be an app like shazam that tells you if someone is famous"
"3638","6 is spot on lmao"
"3639","Also watched Shazam Thursday. Comedy in the film was actually kinda solid, and Zackary Levi is a good lead with delivering the humor. I think it still has the problem almost all superhero films have now though being that they all feel like the same movie"
"3640","I literally gasp when I saw Ross Butler appeared in Shazam. <U+0001F602>"
"3641","Shazam was really disappointing. It’s funny and the actors are good, but it’s a really dumb plot, at times insensitively cruel (esp for adopted kids), and far too dark and violent. 6/10. Bummer."
"3642","Shazam was just perfect for a family fun night @ZacharyLevi do we see more of the @ShazamMovie family?"
"3643","@DEADLINE Just came out of it really beautiful in IMax loved it i really wished they started the DCEU with WW, Aquaman and Shazam"
"3644","#Shazam is only better than Suicide Squad and Justice League!!!"
"3645","@Josh2Gud4U Shazam! sometimes is innocent and sometimes is dirty. I mean, there are a lot of F words in this movie. 

And I loved it."
"3646","@TokenBlackNerd Saw someone putting Shazam beneath BvS and MOS and I had to spring into action"
"3647","Rating my favourite DC movies from best to worst 

1. The Dark Knight  / Wonder Woman
2. The Dark Knight Rises
3. Man of Steel
4. Shazam
5. Aquaman
6. Batman Vs. Superman
7. Justice League
8. Suicide Squad 

Still the answers may change with time and mood."

"3650","Me: I think Shazam was better than Cap Marvel

Rando: That means Cap Marvel was awful

Me: No, I said Shazam was the better movie

Rando: Which means Cap Marvel sucked

Me: No, I meant both movies were good but Shazam was the better one

Rando: Meaning Cap Marvel was shit

"3662","i grew up watching most of marvel movies, and now i want to know more about dc (well, actually i already did since i watched suicide squad. but my curiosity gets bigger now that i watched aquaman and shazam lol)"
"3663","saw Shazam today with Mrs H and our three younger boys (9,11 and 16) and we all loved it. Such good fun and a great heart; truly a family movie. The group of kids was named the ShaFAM by our 11 year old and that's sticking."
"3664","@jrosaIes13 No. Big had the same plot as Shazam only without super powers...but the new movie has some homage to Hanks."
"3665","Shazam had a great and hilarious first act, but it had a weak final act. It started with a strong SHA... but fizzled out at zam. #shazam #saymyname"

"3675","@wehaveahulkpod It’s a great fun movie! Was lucky enough to see it back on March 18th at a special screening. Seeing it again today! #Shazam"
"3676","I think I was just spoiled for a certain cameo in Shazam so fuck you random YouTube channel that decided to put it in the thumbnail"
"3677","Shazam is out now and Endgame is also out. I'm a big DC fan but I've followed the MCU since I was 9 ( 
saw Iron Man 1 in the cinema) so Imma have to watch Endgame and maybe (illegally) stream Shazam"
"3678","There was a kid behind me at the cinema who were always talking to his father about the movie and the franchise, like he said if Shazam will be in Justice League 2? His father was annoyed and just answered him ""I don't know"" always. 

It made me uwu."
"3679","It is so rare to see kids being interested in DCEU, because it's not suitable for them. It was dark, less humor and complicated storylines. So happy they're getting interested because of Shazam which they can relate it to."
"3680","Even though I have some problems with Shazam I still enjoyed it"
"3681","@ZacharyLevi I got to see it two weeks ago thanks to Fandango's Early Access screenings. I'll definitely be watching it this Sunday, and probably again next weekend because this movie was fantastic! Congratulations to you and the entire cast/crew on a job very well done. #Shazam #ShazamMovie"

"3685","@IvanFilmFix Well yea. DC doesn't have the track record. This is the second in a row to be generally well received. If DC is getting it together and Shazam is proof then of course people are going to hype it up."
"3686","This artist should be doing a monthly for DC that runs in LINE WEBTOON and in print."
"3687","Plus the #QuestFor250 is officially over! Tune in to hear how you could win a free copy of the Almost Got 'Im game!"
"3688","Shazam was all I ever wanted and more from the DCEU, left the theater smiling from ear to ear<U+0001F927>"
"3689","Yes - and not in that forced, eye-rolling way Whedon tried in Justice League."
"3690","I got my ticket to see Shazam during a Tuesday afternoon, when I not scheduled to work. Best part is this will be an IMAX viewing, which is an immersive experience. <U+0001F929><U+0001F9B8><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"3691","@AwesomEmergency here"
"3692","DC movies should go with this route. More Shazam, more Joker, more movies that stand on their own (even Wonder Woman and Aquaman, to a certain extent, are two stand alone movies that aren't playing into larger long form universe building franchise.)<U+0001F918><U+0001F4A6>"
"3693","@GrabsGranite Nice pick ups and I knew you would love #Shazam it's an absolutely wonderful film. I love that Shazam cover wowee"

"3702","@ZacharyLevi I know it is a big weekend with @ShazamMovie opening and all, but we would do a disservice to #Chuck sters if we did not pause to celebrate the 9th anniversary of Chuck and Sarah doing the deed for the first time.  Who could not fall in love with @Y_Strahovski?"
"3703","@johncampea It’s always fun to recognize hometown spots in films. Looking forward to seeing Shazam and spotting all the TO scenes!"
"3704","I get that the bar is SUPER low for DC right now but the idea that Shazam is as wonderfully diverse as Black Panther and Homecoming (in terms of live-action) is utterly absurd."

"3724","@ZacharyLevi's Shazam! is absolutely excellent, perfect mix of comedy, action and thrill! I 100% recommend."
"3725","Went into Shazam for my kid. Left with what might be my favorite origin story movie ever. Amazing evidence that superhero movies do not need edge or darkness to be fantastic. Walking out singing ""lightning hands"" with my kid to ""Eye of the Tiger"" was a moment I'll never forget."
"3726","What a terrific, hilarious entertaining first half. #Shazam <U+0001F60D> #MovieReview"
"3727","The DCEU has had a lot of misfires, but they've hit a home run with Shazam! (the exclamation mark is in the title, I didn't add it for effect). — feeling happy"

"3739","another reason why shazam was mean a lot to me, is because, i finally know the answer when someone ask ""where do u see urself in 10 years?"" i'll say, ""in a foster child house like what vasquez couple did with their life."""
"3740","#Shazam is surging past expectations and has an “A” Cinemascore. Word-of-Mouth is rightly exuberant on this movie. It’s another winner for WB and DC, and I can’t rave about it enough."
"3741","@DailyDoseofWho Loved Shazam! And make sure to stay all the way through the end credits."
"3742","Can't wait to watch Shazam when it's available on Netflix, as long as they don't release anything with a concept that I find remotely interesting at the same time."
"3743","On the one hand #Shazam is one of the funiest superhero movies ever, on the other hand it also offers a dark and serious atmosphere which I loved to watch. This balance between the two aspects is truly unique."
"3744","I saw this last night and it was super cute"
"3745","People complained about BvS showing Doomsday in the trailer, but then wanna complain how the Seven Deadly Sin creatures were saved for the actual Shazam film? I loved it and they were a pleasant sight to behold."
"3746","the weirdest thing about #ShazamMovie is the fact that its basically shooting for a broad family movie (pretty good), except for like 2 or 3 scenes which are unnecessarily horrific (pretty bad)? like dc almost finished washing all the edge off but missed some demon-sized spots"
"3747","wait is shazam underperforming?

what the actual fuck?"
"3748","And I’m so happy for such. There’s tons of people of color in it, representing many different races, especially with the main characters, and if I can remember correctly, I think Shazam took a picture with a lesbian couple. 

This film is a blessing to everyone."
"3749","@ZacharyLevi Saw it last night with my 2 grandsons and they loved it!<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> Xander said it was his favorite of all the super hero movies! That's quite a compliment, by the way - he's serious about his heroes! Thank you for such a great movie! #Shazam"
"3750","If you want an idea of what the average hipster millennial thinks about what comic book movies are supposed to be look in the comments here"
"3751","the Shazam movie is amazing btw!! my husband always loved shazam (aka the actual captain marvel) and he loved it so much and it just says a lot bc he didn’t fall asleep"

"3754","Shazam totally awesome<U+0001F60D>

"3758","I'm 31 and enjoy the shit out of it. It didn't feel like a kid movie but definitely for everyone."
"3759","Clarification re: previous tweet: Not literally.  We have not literally seen the movie Shazam!."
"3760","Dkldlf so I watched #Shazam last night and it was honestly such a good movie. Very funny but also serious, definitely recommend"
"3761","@Thru_Hiker09 So you’d put Aquaman and Shazam! After Justice League?"
"3762","The first twitter_
I watched the movie.I think I'm Shazam that have strong power and a weak heart.I can do many things but sometimes I don't know if I should do it or how I do. It looks funny for people but it's sad for me.
So it's the problem:how I should do?
Be stronger.

"3769","@ponysmasher Really enjoyed the videos you did on your YT channel for Annabelle: Creation, any chance we’ll get something like that for #Shazam"
"3770","#Shazam was pretty great. Definitely an even more light hearted movie than I was expecting. Great film to catch!"

"3781","Went to see #Shazam last night with @julia_amaral426. Despite picking a lousy theater (no recliners), I absolutely loved it. Lots of fun, lots of heart. 

I’d say a solid 85/100 &amp; without question the best DC movie."

"3787","@THR Good opening for Shazam , over 50M is really good, and could be over 170M at the end in USA, only because the Storm called Avengers is in 2 weeks."
"3788","i really got a new yellow coat and some jeans with a red stripe down the side so i’ll coordinate with shazam tomorrow i"

I'm on the fence of seeing it in theater or waiting for DVD."
"3792","Michelle Borth who plays Lt. Catherine Rollins is in the movie Shazam with Zachary Levi as the lead #H50"

"3794","The diversity jumped out! We stan the #ShazamFamily"
"3795","This movie better be reach +1B because DC deserves it! Btw i will watch this movie next week.................. <U+0001F61A>"
"3796","@GraceRandolph Shazam isn’t my kind of superhero movie. The trailer alone makes me disinterested and I’m not surprised people would not spam it because it’s between #CaptainMarvel  and Endgame"
"3797","Not gonna lie, today I realized that Shazam is NOT a remake of Kazaam with Shaq. Not gonna lie, it’s almost as disappointing as learning that Boss Baby And Baby Driver weren’t the same thing..."

"3805","How Sandberg tells Shazam story is more more more better than Jenkins's Wonder Woman and James Wan's Aquaman. Sandberg really touch my heart and bring back childhood feels. They really did well for potraying a 14 years old boy who got superpower and keep your family close :)"
"3806","Very happy to know they are going to the right path. As DC fan, couldnt more be happier than this. Can't wait for JOKER too. The Academy must prepare the oscar. :))"

"3808","Y’all need to go see Shazam this weekend! @ZacharyLevi was great in Chuck and he’s even better in Shazam, I swear he was born for this movie. DC finally made a movie that embraces the comics and is actually FUN, absolutely loved it."

"3814","@ShazamMovie First truly Great. Film of 2019."
"3815","@davidallengreen I'd enjoy it! As well as keeping up to speed on Brexit, I love comics (writing about them is part of my job). Btw: I seriously recommend Shazam!"
"3816","Checking out the #ShazamMovie
here we go."
"3817","Shazam was really good. Not great or anything special but it had heart and was really funny at times."
"3818","Reality is I like Shazam but honestiy all these realms and magic are going to make it hard to care.  I’d much rather a Justice League Dark anything maybe paired with The Outlaws"
"3819","@DynastyOuthouse @DynastyJunkieFF @EtanMozia @JukeGarrett @SportsSavi @FFTraderJoe @DFF_Shane @DynastyFFAddict No. That is Shazam... though he started out as Captain Marvel"

"3822","Shazam was fun. The halfway point really drags but the third act is p good.

It's got some crazy nightmare fuel though goddamn"
"3823","I'm going to go see Shazam later today, and I always get a diet Pepsi with popcorn at the cinema. I'm on a diet right now though, so I'm planning on starving myself all day so that I have enough calories for the popcorn. Also: would you be interested in a review of Shazam?"
"3824","@ShazamMovie É DEMAISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS @ZacharyLevi is so funny!!!!!!! (and so beautiful!!!) I want to watch again ahahahahahahahah LOL"
"3825","Shazam gets an A.  That's really good.  Should have legs."
"3826","I’ve already had this conversation with @TheeAnnaMaria already but I would sincerely like to know what music director was like “yes, let’s play this @NiallOfficial song that’s CLEARLY about boning over a family dinner scene with children in #ShazamMovie” cause it blew my mind."

"3829","I'd love to know what the Marvel equivalents of Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman are. Or even Wonder Woman. Thematically, tonally and quality wise of course."
"3830","#Shazam once visited #KansasCity saw some great municipal projects and met local famous people such as Sam Molen and H. Roe Bartle while also battling juvenile delinquency. #CaptainMarvel #FawcettComics #DCComics #Missouri #comicbooks"
"3831","@AhYezzir @ERCboxoffice Shazam doesn’t need aquaman type numbers to be a success. Much lower budget. Christmas movies always have far higher opening to total multiplier. So I wouldn’t hold Shazam to that standard"
"3832","@ScottMendelson @BlackMajikMan90 @HugoByrne2 @Forbes In nyc amc matinees are $8. Still a pretty good deal. I just dropped close to $300 this week on Endgame tickets. That’s like an entire summer’s movie budget. I wish Shazam released in August. Definitely would’ve checked out then."
"3833","Shazam the best DC movie. Up there with the good Marvel films too"
"3834","The use of color @ShazamMovie uses is so awesome and I would get into more and nerd out about it more, but I think it's very spoilery. Anywhooo, dm me if you wanna hear my thoughts about the beautiful use of color.

"3835","@ScottMendelson @Forbes Shazam! was a fun movie with great performances and a few extremely pleasant surprises."
"3836","@EricVespe My problem with this is that “Shazam” is rated PG-13. Don’t take your young children to a PG-13-rated movie and then get angry about it when they get scared."

"3841","Used to watch it only in DC animated movies but now it's in the movieverse! — watching Shazam! Movie"
"3842","We're off to Shazam in a few.
I've waffled over seeing Pet Semetary, too, but I'm wary about getting movie'd out since there's much I want to see this year.
BUT, there might be value in my perspective since (confession time) I haven't seen the original ... or read the book."
"3843","slow hands randomly starts playing in the middle of shazam??? the niall stan jumped out"
"3844","I half expected someone to say Captain Marvel but then Zaptain America just became the best #Marvel easter egg in #Shazam."
"3845","but no results came in, cause there was no signal. then we waited... and waited, until little eugene choi poofed into a shazam eugene choi. i immediately grabbed my friend, and well the rest is up to you. you look good in grey, i couldnt help but fangirl."
"3846","Looks like I'll be watching the Shazam movie tonight with my buddies.

I'm expecting an okay-ish movie but I liked Aquaman quite a bit, so I guess my hopes rose a little up because of that.

I HOPE IT'S A FUN MOVIE AT LEAST"
"3847","So I think some people aren't gonna like what I thought about Shazam, but I can at least say that Zachary Levi is perfect in the role and I'd love to see more of him as this character"
"3848","Homies, get out there and see Shazam, support your DC films."
"3849","@ponysmasher while watching #shazam is it possible I might miss these scenes???"
"3850","About to head over to the movies and watch #SHAZAM"
"3851","Damn, that movie is going to eat an entire afternoon or evening when I see it. Good to know"
"3852","I'm not gonna praise if for that yet cuz I haven't seen the role the POC have, there is a point to be had if they didn't have much screentime as Freddie, Shazam and sivana all who are white"
"3853","@wisCOwilz @MJ54 @Melvingordon25 Trust me I want solo movies about the members of JL as well. However, I appreciate the variety. And Aquaman and Shazam are members of the JL so I don’t know what you’re talking about."
"3854","@akasan @ShazamMovie Endgame is the most important comic book movie to see right now. Shazam can wait lol"

#PetSematary     
#UnicornStore

I’ll be dropping my reviews/scores later.
Busy weekend. I love it."
"3857","I was shocked that Shazam is actually dceu movie after watching it. I mean it's so hard to believe that dceu will have such an amazing movie like Shazam. Surprisingly this movie made me really interested on Billy Batson aka Shazam and his world."
"3858","Haters can suck it. Shazam was worth the hype and the 94% rating in rotten tomatoes<U+0001F525>"
"3859","@lottalosten @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher As your occasional Twitter pal, I’ve felt giddily close to this movie for a while now. Can’t wait to see it."
"3860","I do not accept that Shazam was not, in fact, and early 90s movie starring Sinbad."
"3861","Go see/enjoy both and stop being a piss baby"
"3862","@ZacharyLevi got my popcorn &amp;sour patch kids already for #Shazam"
"3863","@rudol9h Shazam reminded me of the muslims of old bro when offered leadership and governship they refused but they were the most worthy and also shazam was also self sacrificing and brave its why he gets chosen"

"3874","Heading for a 50-55m weekend
Lifetime may be around 180m domestically"
"3875","On one side you have Shazam with bear Superman level power but on the other Ironman is smarter and has more experience. Not to mention To y would be more ruthless that Billy in a one on one I feel!"
"3876","going to clear my head before tonight's big game (my Texas Tech Red Raiders vs Michigan State) with an early showing of Shazam then some tex mex food from a hole in the wall Mexican place that would fail a health inspection!"

Me, well-read, skateboarding past movie theater on opening night, yelling: ""Shazam is an acronym-based incantation Billy Batson used to turn into Captain Marvel: 'Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury!'"""
"3885","SHAZAM is the best DC movie so far"
"3886","My dad threw a wrench in my plans for today bcuz hes taking me to see Shazam so I'm not complaining"
"3887","@Superman0621 Henry did it because his manager/agent was one of the exec producers. Plus, he believes in the character of Superman as well as seeing the potential of Shazam/Captain Marvel. We will see him next time. I was cool with only the cameo of his body, but of course wanted to see him."
"3888","See how we are just laughing in this #shazam movie <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923>"

"3898","I'm going to go see Shazam soon. I've been pronouncing it in my head similar to ""chasm"" all morning and giggling.

This is how corrupted my sense of humor has become."
"3899","throwing shade at the Snyderverse"
"3900","Shazam was really good. Really good child actors all round. And the post credits scene sets up the most unlikely villain for the sequel."
"3901","Going to see #Shazam today with the wifey. I'm excited to see how it is."
"3902","@BlackMajikMan90 @HugoByrne2 @ScottMendelson @Forbes Sounds like they have their own priorities. Like many around the world saving money for endgame...as Shazam is not performing well on overseas."
"3903","Shazam! is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and the story was entertaining the whole way throughout the show. Go see it!"
"3904","I'm still not over Shazam and I need to see it again."
"3905","@tomorrowfics if you can't stream on spotify or apple music don't stress about it just make youtube your priority you can also shazam the song to give it more chances of radio play that's it that's enough. I don't see the point in mentioning other apps since this is what we have goals for so +"
"3906","There will be no Superman without lex Luther, no Batman without The Joker, no Avengers without Thanos, no Shazam without Black Adam. There is a reason for obstacles in our lives. It brings the best in us<U+0001F60A>"
"3907","In my opinion, the movie shazam is not so bad after all. Screw all you people who said that its a bad movie. Why can't you just enjoy a fucking superhero movie. Screw all of you"
"3908","@RKGvideo Would love to be there but sunny Northern Ireland and Shazam is calling. Have a bezzer night."

"3915","To summarise, #Shazam is a triumph, understands the superhero genre like few did recently. Amazing cast and storytelling.  An emotional rollercoaster. As said in my reaction, a Gift for the genre, and a winner for WB.
PS: wait til the end of the last bunch of credits. PT 15/15"
"3916","Shazam is a fantastic movie!! <U+2764> Zachary Levi and all the kids are perfectly cast. So much fun and heart. <U+0001F917> Everyone needs to go watch!  @DCComics #Shazam @ShazamMovie"
"3917","@DC_FYILeague @MJ54 @Melvingordon25 Shazam wasn’t in the JL movie and just because he is in the comics doesn’t mean he is in the movies. Their universe is so disconnected."
"3918","@akasan @ShazamMovie In one of your videos you say when your watching a movie in jappan you can’t be excited and laugh and stuff how come? And are you coming to us to watch endgame so you can show how excited you are"
"3919","#Shazam is SO FUN. It's easily my favourite DCEU entry now, and tbh, I'm this close to walking straight into the next showing of it."
"3920","@ZacharyLevi I’ve just watched @ShazamMovie for the 2nd time in less than 24 hours. 

I’m thinking I need to watch it again though, just in case I missed anything when I blinked. <U+0001F60F>

Thoughts? <U+0001F914>

#Shazam"
"3921","@ponysmasher watched #shazam today, the movie is full of heart, fun, emotions, etc..<U+0001F44C><U+0001F618>one of the best origin superhero movie I have ever watched <U+0001F44C>it's super fun and thrilling, the final fight is terrific<U+0001F525>@ZacharyLevi you are born to play shazam<U+0001F44C><U+0001F60D><U+0001F618> @AsherAngel Is Awesome<U+0001F618>"
"3922","Watched #Shazam last night and still find a few things unbelievable. Not the superpowers and wizardry, but the way some parents on screen acted toward their kids...<U+0001F92F>"
"3923","Chill start to my day. Shave, brush teeth, coffee and water, a peanut butter and lingonberry jam sandwich, a banana; soon going to get dressed so I can get ready to watch ""Shazam"" with the parents, which we'll do today instead of tomorrow because I'm off work."
"3924","@getFANDOM @RottenTomatoes Saw #Shazam yesterday and it very fun. Don't think it's right to compare this movie to #CaptainMarvel because their both completely different movies."
"3925","#Shazam is fun but my word is the third act way too repetitive and tiresome."
"3926","Just watched SHAZAM! Best part of the movie was easily @Handlebrody playing yet another role perfectly. Awesome way to end the night"
"3927","500 tweets in the last hour about #Shazam and none of them are about the burning cello in the lair"
"3928","I'm in the cinema seeing shazam but I'm also like. feeling Incredibly suicidal so let's see how this goes"
"3929","Saw @ShazamMovie for the third time yesterday, first ever in-person date with @Jargo360

We both loved it!

Can’t wait to talk about the movie with folks now that it’s finally out! 

#Shazam"
"3930","Oh yeah I saw Shazam the other day on the first day of reopening of my favourite cinema after it shut down like 4 years ago. Movie was REALLY good, cgi was a bit crap on the monsters but the designs where great so I didn’t mind, was weirdly dark in one scene despite it’s overall-"
"3931","About to see @ShazamMovie ! Looking very forward!"
"3932","Hahaha i thought of a comicbook character omg:))) Hahahhaahhaha  the effects of watching Shazam!"
"3933","Them nor dey believe una for this twitter"
"3934","At the movies. Shazam is showing in a theater right next to Captain Marvel. What a time to be alive."
"3935","I hope I can see a support soon next week possibly. And I want other people who sees this to do the same.  Please go #SupportShazam"
"3936","@Dumbo I think #1 goes to Shazam"
"3937","@ZourenIf @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie At this point I’d say $170-180 Million. Overseas it’s comparing to WW which was $125. $55 in USA that should be 170-180."
"3938","@ZourenIf @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie At this point I’d bet quite higher than that."
"3939","@BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie Opening Weekend range?."
"3940","@ikeonmovies That's a weird take to put the actually good DC movies (WW, Aquaman, and Shazam) on the same level as the crappy ones <U+0001F914>"
"3941","@RunnerofMazes17 @BoxOffice Yes considering it just opened... was made only on 98 million dollars budget and Shazam isn’t a popular character like Batman, Superman etc"
"3942","@BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie This is good considering it just opened... was made only on 98 million dollars budget and Shazam isn’t a popular character like Batman, Superman etc"
"3943","Just got back from seeing Shazam! That surprise near the end...saw a face i haven’t seen in ages. @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial did an amazing job! Also loved seeing @smugorange in it <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>"
"3944","@Gamehendge18 @ShazamMovie You should checkout into the spiderverse"
"3945","@dakotalanthimos yeah doubt it will get to 1 billion.  Shazam isn't a well known name like the level of Spider-man is.  so $700 million worldwide for a superhero not many people have heard of is really great."
"3946","@dakotalanthimos probably not that many, but probably 4x more than Shazam.  Disney has built a great 20 something movies though and the fan base is always looking out for the next movie at this point.  Shazam just came out of the blue and if it makes 60 - 70% of what CM bo, that's great victory!"
"3947","Watched @ShazamMovie today and have to say it's not action packed like other superhero movies but it's funny , awesome and just can't simply hate it even if u want to. Just go watch it guys it's really good. #SHAZAM @ZacharyLevi  @TheDCUniverse"
"3948","I got unreasonably upset at my husband (who loved the movie) when he said Shazam's WW gross has been bad, that it released at a bad time, and would've been a better summer release. Like damn, yeah all that shit is true but I still felt defensive as all hell lmao"
"3949","I know my taste is a bit different. Reading ppl happy that Shazam is joyful. How they call it a breath of fresh air from heavy superhero films. I personally love those heavy and dark films."
"3950","@RyanFilmLover I dig it, I’m glad Shazam is light and playful. I personally hope other films still have darker side to them"
"3951","What movie to watch at the cinemas?? 

#movies #cinema #movie #Shazam #PetSemetary #comedy #horror"
"3952","@stefangoodchild @Z303 Go and see Shazam! (the true Captain Marvel with no disrespect to Captain Danvers!)

It is so far from dark and miserable."
"3953","While the @Marvel one was a great Dragon Ball rip off full of wow, the  @DCComics take personally got me to the gut several times on the verge  of tears throughout right till the end.

#Shazam is truly something  special, what ""superhero"" films should aspire to be <U+0001F62D>"
"3954","@alicexz Please go see Shazam if you have the time. It's a great family movie that put laughter and love in my heart. Take care."
"3955","Loved this movie!! Way better than I thought!"
"3956","Actually, the more I think about it... they’re kind of... not wrong. <U+0001F615>

Diversity is more than just the color of our skin. I learned that when I was the head of an organization that demanded it in college. 

Hard pill to swallow, for some."
"3957","Shazam! is such a good movie. Sorry to the girl Emily spilled out Dr Pepper on"
"3958","I ADORED this delightful movie!!<U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> Truly a feel good start to my weekend. As predicted by my mom when surprised by a trailer of it, @ZacharyLevi was PERFECT in this role!"
"3959","@usedwigs Yeah, weird that no one talks about the Shazam /“Isis” hour anymore<U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"3960","Bringing back this photo since it's #5DaysToMapOfTheSoul. So excited to see and hear what @BTS_twt have in store for us. Can't wait to shazam the main track of MOTS. <U+0001F49C><U+0001F60A>"

"3962","@ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher 
Loved the movie
Would rate it 9/10
Absolutely loved it
Thank you

"3963","Shazam is overrated teenage movie .. my personal rating 3/10 
#Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"3964","I have 9 (yes, nine) Marvel Comics tshirts in my closet and only 1 (yes, one) Detective Comics tshirt. I'm going to see Shazam today and I can't find the only DC shirt I own. Guess it's off to Old Navy to buy a second DC tee."
"3965","so far, shazam is the best movie i’ve watched in 2019"
"3966","That awkward moment when you're off to watch #ShazamMovie wearing a Marvel Comics t-shirt because it's laundry day."
"3967","DC putting a ridiculous amount of marketing dollars toward Shazam and all Marvel had to do was make one trailer to fuck them up lol"
"3968","@Mwelele_zaza358 @Wika_Kawina I hear they wanted to introduce Shazam, do a Black Adam solo movie and then have them face off. I hope to see it next week."
"3969","@Wika_Kawina said DC finally got it right.
That's something"
"3970","@ZacharyLevi Shazam was truly the super hero role that you were meant to play. Shazam has a good good heart and wants to do the right thing. You have those same qualities. What you did with Nerd HQ was bring people together and create a family. Shazam does the same."
"3971","@ZacharyLevi That is what is so great about this movie. It brings people together. It brings old Shazam fans together with new ones. One of the many messages of the movie is that family sticks by you and not every family looks the same. A family is a group of people that support each other."
"3972","@Midnightsoul23 Same. I'm happy about people saying that about Shazam because it's hard to picture that character being in a dark serious film. Still I'd be open to seeing a darker take on it"

"3980","Went to see Shazam today. It was ok.  I quite liked it. I didn’t hate it. After Aquaman (hated), Wonderwoman (hated), Suicide Squad (really hated), Justice League (really hated), Batman v Superman (hated) and Man of Steel (too boring to hate) this came as a pleasant surprise."

"3985","Nice to see DC finally not taking themselves too seriously with #Shazam For a character I wasn't overly familiar with I am definitely up for a sequel."
"3986","@Tigu_El They actually did. Such a witty movie. People didn't go to watch it because they don't know Shazam <U+0001F602>"
"3987","@enaj PS - Do you ever use Shazam? The saved list from it has become my “I like that song” list."
"3988","@ZacharyLevi watched you signing autographs outside #firstdate years ago.  You were a superhero then ( girl in a giant motorized wheelchair and you gave her so much of your time!) made watching #ShazamMovie all the better.  #superhero"
"3989","My friends and I went to see Shazam in IMAX yesterday but he place was packed and we watched Pet Sematary instead.

It was an enjoyable experience. That’s really all I could say about it lol."
"3990","Tbh I was pulling for us to watch Us after we realized Shazam wasn’t going to work, but we missed the showtime smh. My friend saw Captain Marvel already too so we didn’t consider that an option lol."
"3991","Well the new Screen X thing. I didn't think it was all that special. Not with Shazam anyway. There was one funny moment with it but other than not. Meh."
"3992","Shazam earned an ‘A’ CinemaScore. Only recent DC film to score that high, other than Wonder Woman."
"3993","SHAZAM??? More like SHAZAMAZING!!! Haha sobrang dali ko na ma-impress lately haha pero it really was a breath of fresh air especially in the dark, dark world of DC movies."
"3994","@BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie It’s going to have room as well for strong legs to develop. Some OS territories are on the low side but are still ahead of The First Avenger and Ant Man"
"3995","So fun seeing Chuck shooting electricity from his hands <U+26A1> Great movie! #Shazam @ZacharyLevi"
"3996","Your friend who “didn’t know we were doing rounds”"
"3997","@TID_JByrne also you know i work at a theatre. shazam is well liked here and i think it’ll be a movie that’ll spread by word of mouth"
"3998","@ZacharyLevi Congratulations on the critical and commercial success of #Shazam! Great opening day and more coming when my wife and I see it tomorrow (damn jobs!!!)...

Any chance that in the #ChuckMovie the #Tron poster gets replaced by one of #BillyBatson ?!?!

Much love!!"
"3999","@duckpuppers Was colder than I expected. Around 65 degree and windy so my desert dwelling hosts found it very cold. For me it was perfect. Next adventure is just to go to the movies and see Shazam. But I hope to catch a ghost town as well"
"4000","MCU stans really are quaking over people enjoying Shazam as if Endgame isn’t going to make two billion even if it’s mediocre. Get a grip."
"4001","Just went to see Shazam! Really dissatisfied... 6/10 <U+0001F624>"
"4002","What if we all go see and support both movies how bout that?"
"4003","@ShazamMovie was a lot of fun! Really got a kick out of the various Philly landmarks that were incorporated in the movie! Recommend checking it out!"
"4004","This movie was phenomenal. Just the right mix of comedy and seriousness and the cinematography was genuinely fantastic. @ZacharyLevi congratulations"
"4005","As a fellow big dude, I wasn't necessarily offended by either. Yet, I also have this strange superpower to respect other people's feelings and understand where they're coming from. You don't get it from a spider bite or a wizard granting you powers. It's called empathy."
"4006","#6 Shazam! 

- 2.5/5 - I was actually quietly excited for this movie going in but unfortunately was disappointed! There were some really funny moments but the story fell flat and the action sequences also kind of fell flat."
"4007","Even if I did get over the hurdle of GETTING more Shazam, I've read enough comics to know that the comic almost always reads as an entirely different product from the onscreen version, rather than a thematic expansion of what I just watched. Rarely is this not the case."
"4008","I KNOW how to get more Shazam.
I know how to get more, legally and illegally.
I know how to get more, physically and digitally.
I know how to get more, from specialty and general stores.
I even know which stories to start with.
I would not know this if I wasn't already a fan."
"4009","@BangtanTrends @BTS_twt Try to rest well before the comeback date and use all the devices you can stream for comeback. Youtube account; spotify, naver, shazam app, play list on spotify,....and FOCUS ONLY ON BTS COMEBACK SUPPORT IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY!

"4013","Shazam may be the move tonight"
"4014","shazam is the only man ever"
"4015","Love these @jonathanrichler @sheldonantle @byr_ne"
"4016","@e_williams518 That’s always been the DC movie universe’s problem. Their solo films are great, but when they put so many characters together so quickly without background to any of them, it flops. (Side Note: saw Shazam last night and it was great, probably fav DC movie since Man of Steel)"
"4017","@wyattyhalpert And remember when aquaman was released, they said 'wanna be thor' and now Shazam to Deadpool. What's next? Joker to ""wanna be venom"""
"4018","Just watched #SHAZAM awesome film you gotta watch it @TheDCUniverse @WarnerBrosUK @IMDb @thatstarwarsgrl"
"4019","i want to see shazam but none of my friends or family wants to sigh"
"4020","Just watched #Shazam and I must say, #DC has still got hope!
Super hilarious, interesting. Though felt casting could've been a little better but in totality, enjoyed a lot with many hilarious moments!"
"4021","Going to see #Shazam in about 30 minutes movie is at noon"
"4022","#Shazam was really great. My only gripes were the pacing in the first half and the fact that 2 hours and 12 minutes is too long for a movie like this. Still really enjoyable and honestly wouldn't mind seeing it a second time. 8/10."
"4023","@MarvelStudios @MarvelStudios what’s your review of the movie @ShazamMovie (Captain Marvel)<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> @wbpictures @ZacharyLevi"
"4024","Saw ""Shazam"" yesterday, loved it.  I thought they got his character exactly right, it was fun but had some serious/emotional moments as well, and it actually held up great in the third act (while I liked Aquaman and Wonder Woman they both had weak 3rd acts for me)."
"4025","Considering seeing #shazam again today.  Might even do a double feature with #PetSematary if I'm able.  Hopefully the rain will let up enough to get out and not get soaked.<U+0001F605>"
"4026","The plan right now is go see Shazam at 1 and my brother is ready"
"4027","@ZacharyLevi My son and I watched Shazam last night.  Thank you.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

He’s our youngest but is off to college in the fall and moments like last night will become more and more rare.  I’m glad we were able to see it together.

Thank you."
"4028","Holy moley! Waiting to see @ShazamMovie. Can’t tell you how excited I am to see this. @ZacharyLevi"
"4029","@jordantolbert18 Yeah it was gross. And it was also hard for me bc I’ve watched The Flash tv series for years and grant gustin has become Barry so I had a hard time buying Ezra Miller. The solo movies are just better. Man of steel, aquaman, Shazam were all very good. They need better writers"
"4030","@jordantolbert18 Also saw Shazam last night and agree completely. They had the same problem w justice league and dawn of justice. JL threw flash aquaman and cyborg w/o any background. And as a HUGE flash fan that hurt bc he has such a complicated past. It’s a shame really"
"4031","@sarahwhit10 WB bent over for the crybabies, 'strayed' from their once serious formula &amp; has actually embraced the disney/marvel strategy. Shazam has the mcu/spiderboy homecoming formula all over it. Get real <U+0001F605>"

"4035","With regards to my struggling to leave the house to see Shazam; I've roped my father in to drive me to the car park under the cinema, accompany me to the movie, then drive me home. Being agoraphobic AND a huge nerd is a logistical nightmare."
"4036","I’m so glad I went to see Shazam yesterday. The theater was packed and the audience did interact and have fun together :,) it was so sweet"

"4039","Saw it weeks ago and is #3 on my list."
"4040","As much fun as i make of Shazam, I really want to see it."
"4041","@TheComixKid I feel the issue could be lack of trust/confidence in films like this given how bad some DC films have been. I thought #Shazam was fantastic. It had heart, was legit funny, and featured great performances. My fear was it might get buried with the big releases around it..."

For a children/YA movie: 9.5/10 
For an adult movie: 7.5/10 
I’m guessing it’s directed towards a younger audience so i give it a general 8/10
It was very enjoyable/moving/great plot /great cast &amp; acting &amp; direction / was not at all cringey"

"4076","Seeing a lot of people say Shazam is the best DC hero movie.....y’all know who Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are right? #shazamwonthaveatrilogy"
"4077","this is bs honestly justice league was an okay movie but it DOES NOT deserve to be named the worst dceu movie when suicide squad exists"
"4078","I dreading going see it, shit lols gay to me"
"4079","Went to see Shazam last night. My review: well made and quite funny. Pretty standard plot, but not one I've seen in a superhero movie so it was very welcome. Surprisingly had a pretty good message, again not super original, but refreshing for a superhero movie. 8/10."
"4080","I can’t wait to watch this movie with Vanessa today<U+0001F917>"
"4081","woah what weh? omg is dc fibally doing a good job?"

"4083","Could lose about 20 minutes of generic sfx action, but otherwise SHAZAM! is thoroughly enjoyable - a breath of fresh (albeit ozone-charged) in a somewhat stale superhero landscape. Feels honest, not opportunistic."
"4084","@HancokJailed Haven’t watch Shazam yet but Captain Marvel is overall great. The only issue I have with CM is that our main character’s “unstoppable force” lacks an opposing “immovable object” but that’s a good trade-off for an unexpected plot twist."
"4085","Myself, my wife and Brad are going to see #Shazam tonight! My wife told me she is so excited to see the sequel to the 1996 Shaquille O'Neal classic.

No one tell her a fucking thing."
"4086","@TheNelGOD shazam was very good and i have come to agree with you that DC films now each have their own personality and that is a good thing i am glad exists"
"4087","Just watched #ShazamMovie in the cinema. Fantastic film, with great story arcs, character redemption and comedy. A great direction for #DCEU imo. My brain says 8/10 as a final score...but the kid in me says 9/10. I can't wait to see more of #Shazam SHAZAM!!! - nope, nothing <U+0001F623>"
"4088","i had no idea adam brody and ross butler were going to be in Shazam. what a fucking pleasant surprise <U+0001F60D>"
"4089","#ShazamMovie is not only one of the best #DCUNIVERSE movies I’ve seen, it’s one of the best superhero movies I’ve ever seen. 10/10"
"4090","#Shazam is so full of heart and humour. Loved the film! Lots of big surprises in the movie, especially the #ShazamFamily . Could also connect emotionally with th characters. Would love to watch it again!"

"4094","Shazam is the best DC movie I've watched in a long while"
"4095","Saw Shazam lastnight and I enjoyed it. It wasn't all light hearted there was some darkness in it. Loved the family aspect of the movie. And a lil twist in it. Great job @TheDCUniverse its about time y'all are getting the movies right! #SHAZAM"
"4096","Line up today...Go see “Shazam!”...come home and watch ending rounds of Augusta National Ladies amateur (cause I’m from here, so I’m kinda obligated)...then watch the Final Four.   On one hand , it’s a whole lotta nothin’, but on the other hand, it’s a FULL day, right?!?"

"4107","I just saw Shazam &amp; I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!! @ZacharyLevi killed it. It’s comedy but the humour was not forced. Plenty of heart, emotion and also horror. @ponysmasher bring his horror background with the villains."
"4108","#Writerslog 06042019 - managed 1,500 words on my #WIP and watched Shazam. All in all a good day. #amwriting #writing #WritingCommunity"
"4109","#Shazam is pure bliss. I just kept smiling and laughing the whole time. It's got a very light tone, I really didn't expect that. BUT it's got some very contrasting scenes, which made the film more interesting."
"4110","The #ShazamFamily does feel like the Shazam fam. Darla's the cutest one. She really shines on every of her scenes. Pedro is honestly so much fun, couldn't have being better."
"4111","#Shazam hasn't got such a complex plot, but still successfully delivers a heartwarming, relatable value full message. It's all about family. It was beautiful, amazing. A very sweet film of you ask me. <U+0001F496>"
"4112","Ok so #Shazam was actually a very good film, and I never thought I’d say that about a film from the DC Comics universe"
"4113","dematteis linking to a random dailymotion video containing the Shazam episode of justice league international he worked on instead of telling everyone to subscribe to the dc universe streaming service to watch it (as nobody involved is getting any royalties anyway) is good"
"4114","@Moni_Monika_Chr Looking at the Shazam reviews seeing what changes were made to the source material."
"4115","@CHASINGSPlDERS @Sparrow__Scout Kayden add me to the Shazam chat"
"4116","The movie really exceeded my expectations, cause y'all know I was on the fence for the longest about Shazam."
"4117","The promo campaign doesn't do Shazam half the Justice..... there's SO MUCH inside the movie."
"4118","@Mr_J666x @DriggyDriggs Shazam isnt following any tone.. its a fucking wannabe Deadpool marvel movie for kids.. with a dash of headless superman with Williams theme"
"4119","Shazam was superb, After aquaman now shazam, DC really back in the track. 
Shazam 8/10 recommended!"
"4120","Shazam is one of the better comic movies"
"4121","A movie you have to go see. Theres things that the trailer didn't spoil #ShazamMovie"
"4122","Shazam has to be mark strong’s best work since “low winter sun”"
"4123","little girl just walked out of shazam and said “i wanna watch shazam 2” girl...... mood"
"4124","I’m about to see shazam im so excited"
"4125","Shazam. Not bad for my 2nd DC movie. It thought me that real families aren’t always the one which related to you by blood. It’s about who loves you and accept who you are. That’s family."
"4126","Well...guess I’ll be wrong on 60-70 million. I liked this movie and HIGHLY recommend it. #SHAZAM"
"4127","This tweet is the gospel of Graphic Novel truth."
"4128","Shazam was the best film I’ve seen since Infinity War, such a good and down to earth film for a superhero story, really happy seeing DC do well"
"4129","Off to see Shazam and Pet Sematary."
"4130","So proud of @ZacharyLevi for finally showing the rest of the world the super hero that we knew he was all along <U+0001F496> #Shazam"
"4131","For some reason this morning I read a Shazam! review and a commentary on the Joker trailer and oof. Write better."
"4132","Shazam made my day. Zachary Levi, and Ross Butler were just too cute. #Shazam 

Anyway... back to @BTS_twt fangirling!!! Lemme catch up with #BTSLoveYourselfBKK videos! <U+2661>"
"4133","Had fun hanging out with 3 of my friend groups today! I need more days like this. Also watched Shazam and it was soooo good!! Kinda wanna be Shazam..."
"4134","@deotshims @SupesBatsy Totally agree. 
At least SHAZAM can make a “natural jokes”. 
And look...their joke is not too force and also accurate to comic."
"4135","@kageneko @ColbyHubbard6 @HarleyMovieNews Nah. Aquaman was fine and Shazam is rlly good (best DC film by far). There's no need to ""blow it up"", they've got good momentum, now we wait for Birds of Prey and WW84. They're on the right track, don't see why people are still clamoring for a reboot."
"4136","Coming out of Shazam I suddenly remembered what would have happened to Billy Batson in Alan Moore's rejected 1980s Twilight of the Superheroes pitch. The older I get the more I realise that superhero fans really dodged a horrible, depressing bullet when that pitch was rejected."
"4137","shazam is one of the better dceu movie snc i hope it gets the love it deserves"
"4138","i hope #shazam gets the love it deserves because it’s one of the better dceu movies. top 2 tbh."

@BTS_twt #ShazARMYSchool"
"4142","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Such a good movie. 3rd favorite as of now behind BvS and MoS"
"4143","Wow I must have cried a good 10 times during @ShazamMovie I think it might be my fav @DCComics movie. @ZacharyLevi and the whole cast were amazing!!!"
"4144","Loved seeing @jimmyfallon in Shazam last night. Or his brother. Or whoever that Jimmy Fallon was."
"4145","Shazam is the corniest film ever"
"4146","Shazam is the corniest film"
"4147","shazam is actually goood!!<U+26A1>"
"4148","i know some people really don’t like dc and yeah they do have some pretty bad movies but you should really go see shazam. it’s so fun and entertaining but also really cute and heartwarming. you won’t regret it."
"4149","Well shazam was unexpectedly entertaining lol"
"4150","Yahoo and everyone in the comments is seeing this the wrong way. Its just stupid arguing which movie has the most representation. Representation aint a competition. Any form of representation is welcomed and should be praised. Start enjoying things and stop fighting"
"4151","Shazam is gonna smoke pet Semetary, which is good news. @ProduceTravis"
"4152","Just watched #Shazam
It was good considering I am not a fan of the comic book. My nephew thought it was amazing"
"4153","Sad to see this New Direction for DC is failing."
"4154","freddie from shazam reminded me of stiles.......or isit just me?????¿¿?"
"4155","Even if you've lived an unimpeachable life otherwise, if you bought a ticket to Shazam! I hate your fucking guts."
"4156","Sarcasm at its best"
"4157","I think Shazam might be the funniest superhero flick out there. The weirdest part tho was how much they talked about what would happen if he climbed into the villains ass and yelled SHAZAM but otherwise a great movie"
"4158","@MrRighTNoW_818 @breatheonmebrit @272715021 @Sambeet_M A movie that a studio is confident in will have marketing regardless of whether it is the maximum or minimum. Still, Shazam’s marketing is now where near that of Aquaman."
"4159","I regret every minute of watching Shazam. Worst movie ever c:"
"4160","Shazam is easily the best DC movie"
"4161","@RedbeastG I have the same opinion. Both were really great movies, but Shazam was just a little bit better for me."
"4162","Shazam, but for where people bought their glasses from."
"4163","Shazam was great! Unashamedly about being as fun as possible!"
"4164","#Shazam really hit it out of the park. I definitely recommend. It just nailed it on the writing, directing, acting, style, and humor."
"4165","Shazam! was great. In the same vein as Kick-Ass and the  Deadpool movies but not rated R and better than both."
"4166","In film : Shazam <U+27A1><U+FE0F> superhero
irl : Shazam <U+27A1><U+FE0F> know song title"
"4167","@ponysmasher @DaveePena @CinemaScore @ShazamMovie <U+0001F601>

That's super! #Shazam"
"4168","@robcham I fucking loved Shazam man like holy shit is this really DC"
"4169","People are gushing about #Shazam, that makes me happy. Need to actually get to the theater and see this one. With #Joker already looking like an Oscar-caliber film, #DC actually looks like they’re getting their shit together. <U+0001F918><U+0001F3FB>"
"4170","I'm going to see #Shazam #ShazamMovie later today by myself. Does that make me a loser ?"
"4171","@_joshpray Absolutey LOVED that video you did of Shazam! My girlfriend kept watching it over and over again and were laughing so hard!<U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"4172","One thing I love about #Shazam is how we’re seeing a world full of superheroes like Superman and Batman, all through the eyes of kids that idolize those heroes. It really emphasizes that feeling of childlike wonder and reminds you of your own childhood."
"4173","I liked Shazam because not enough things are constantly mentioning that Zachary Levi is the physical ideal."
"4174","@ZacharyLevi Loved the movie #Shazam Definitely a family friendly film, with lots of humor, great storyline! I miss Chuck!!!"
"4175","Sorry but no superhero film is ""the most diverse movie ever"" if the main characters are still male and white. We have Black Panther, we have Captain Marvel, we have Spider-Verse. This doesn't even sit at the table, and I've not seen any POCs in the trailers."
"4176","Just went to see #SHAZAM for the second time in two days....what a film it is. @ZacharyLevi and your team absolutely nailed it...FANTASTIC"
"4177","Finally at cinema and ready to watch Shazam!"
"4178","It’s annoying cause Shazam isn’t doing too well financially but it deserves way better"
"4179","Shazam was just really impressive not just for a dc movie but as a movie overall. Tons of funny moments, loads of heart, great directing and a super memorable villain. Don’t let the fact it’s DC turn you off"
"4180","The best part of this? ""Dude that plays Shazam -- never heard of him, but he got a face I wanna hang out with"" TRUTH"
"4181","@_joshpray <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>As much I loved #shazam this dude is on fire.."
"4182","Been to see Shazam today. Would totally recommend it. It was so hilarious and exciting!"
"4183","This is a 100% accurate review. #Shazam"
"4184","Lower than I hoped, though maybe alright for a non-Batman, non-Superman character. The trailer doesn't do this movie justice. Seriously, one of the best superhero movies made so far from any studio. #Shazam"
"4185","@btsfanmomma @Shazam @STARSonShazam @BTSonShazam Ahhh! Ok. Thanks. I was out all afternoon/evening yesterday and just got to Shazaming today. Must have missed that notification. <U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FB>"
"4186","Hmmm anyone else having issues with getting BTS Map of the Soul: Persona to be recognized by Shazam today???? It was working yesterday and It’s working for every other song I try for? What’s up?? @Shazam @STARSonShazam @BTSonShazam"
"4187","@btsfanmomma @Shazam @STARSonShazam @BTSonShazam Gonna delete this now cuz I did miss the notification and it’s being handled"
"4188","5 isnt the answer to 1+1 baby this doesnt have any correlation to shazam being a diversed film"
"4189","day by day it just shows how little those people know about ‘diversity’ <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"4190","the umbrella academy would be the freemans in shazam if they grew up with love"
"4191","y’all really don’t even care about diversity and just use it for clicks and it shows"
"4192","""Shazam!"" Is pretty great. Recommended."
"4193","SHAZAM’s problem isn’t that it is trying to be funny, but that its characters seem to exist only for humor purposes. The humor doesn’t come from their personality; rather, their behaviors come from the mandate to be funny."
"4194","Going to see Shazam tonight, I never thought I’d say this but I’m really excited for a... DC movie."
"4195","Loved #Shazam 

It's refreshing, fun and super awesome!!
It's like #Deadpool but in a much lighter way!!
Way to go #DCEU but I am glad we are moving in the right direction!!"
"4196","@suckatusername I know James Wan helped get David the job, and I enjoyed Aquaman enough, but I really loved seeing Shazam unfold"
"4197","@sharloola I honestly don't want it to converge with the DCEU ever, just let Shazam be its own franchise, do fun shit again. I really hope people catch on because it deserves our love"
"4198","If you don’t think @ShazamMovie is the best DCEU movie yet you’re insane. Absolutely fantastic! @ZacharyLevi"
"4199","@DefendtheUnique @SamParkerMetal Shazam was awesome and going to see it again"
"4200","@ponysmasher this is why we were mad there was no new Shazam footage after comic con. This is what we were afraid of...

Shazam is now opening to the lowest of all cbm’s 

And it’s all the marketing, timing (between 2 marvel movies), and people thinking it’s a comedy."
"4201","So... I'm not saying the whole film's bad or anything. It's got some really good, heartwarming, touching et cetera scenes in various spots...

But #SHAZAM is what a #DC fan shall get without @ZackSnyder having any sort of inputs.

#ReleaseTheSnyderCut, @wbpictures @WBHomeEnt!!"
"4202","Shazam! is one of the most joyous and fun superhero movies out there, fitting the character perfectly. There’s a few early pacing issues, but the pitch perfect comedy and solid action (and some lively monster design) make for an honestly great film."
"4203","@ZedVonKatmahl I can think of one thing right off the bat. The people who made Shazam and WW weren't going out of their way to be dark and edgy."
"4204","@Trevor56510778 @MSherryprince @gavinfeng97 I am talking about why shazam is flopping 

He will be the producer 

Both were fine films"
"4205","@Trevor56510778 @MSherryprince @gavinfeng97 I know but shazam is flopping"
"4206","@reggiegotlag @SamParkerMetal Yes. She’s probably mad Shazam ended up being better than Captain marvel to the general audience and critics"
"4207","When is there gonna be an app where you can do what u do on a song to find it Shazam for the face cos am sick of seeing the love of me life and not knowin his name"
"4208","I tell people that this will be 2019’s surprise bad ass movie."
"4209","Could be very possible that Youtube has microphone enabled so it listens to the song that's playing if you try to search for it. Therefore, Youtube is the new Shazam."
"4210","@ZacharyLevi I went to go see it because you defending brie larson thank you once again I loved when you said shazam at a certain part no spoilers tho"
"4211","@RoxyfromGotham Lol. Your not alone on this Roxy. It’s not even that controversial, when I saw Shazam, there was a better reaction to the Godzilla trailer than endgame’s trailer."
"4212","Just went to see @ShazamMovie at @ODEONCinemas @ZacharyLevi wow! Great movie guys! So much fun and heart ! Loved it!!!! #Shazam"
"4213","Just back from seeing Shazam and that was good fun. Nowt too special but an entertaining watch"
"4214","Alright folks I have to say that I really enjoy #Shazam it was indeed one of the best super hero movies and one of my new favorite @DCComics movies"
"4215","Last night, I capped off a productive art week with a cigar and then #Shazam . I really feel like the #DCEU took a necessary look at the need for joy in these movies. They did a great job. Just a fun, funny, action-packed movie that will make new fans while respecting older ones."
"4216","@BinaryFighter -After coming back out, Shazam landed upon the planet again after making his return. 
 “Feels good to be back!”"
"4217","Oopl cinema tomorrow for #Shazam <U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B><U+0001F60B>"

"4219","High expectations from you DC, do not disappoint me <U+0001F615> — watching Shazam! Movie"
"4220","Scale of 1-10 Shazam gets a 5."
"4221","hauhauahuahauhauahuau ""What we gonna do Marvel?""
Don't know man, but I think we agree that after the 'Captain Marvels' movies, DC is looking good on the new phase of supehero movies."
"4222","Loved Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy. Demonstrating great comic timing and delivery at such a young age. He has a vunerability to him and holds his own in his scenes with Zachary Levi. #Shazam"
"4223","@momforbangtan @Shazam @STARSonShazam @BTSonShazam I think I saw somewhere that there is a problem....being addressed I believe."
"4224","This time one from DCEU.
The original Captain Marvel... — watching Shazam! Movie"
"4225","I’m finally seeing #Shazam. My body has never been more ready"
"4226","#Shazam was amazing, excellent movie for my first 4D experience and everyone I was with came out with a huge smile on their face. That was amazing!"
"4227","It's a bit tone deaf of Shazam to have a comedy gun shooting scene in which the hero asks the muggers to ""shoot him in the face""; especially after the film goes to great lengths to show the security measures schools have to take in the US."
"4228","#Shazam showed us that Captain Marvel CAN make for an action packed, funny, and overall enjoyable experience."
"4229","Shazam is easily the best film in the DCEU. Make more films like this one, and you'll be giving the MCU more competition, WB."
"4230","I’ve got the afternoon to myself so I’m heading to the mall to walk around a little bit and then seeing @ZacharyLevi in Shazam"
"4231","@DriggyDriggs @LazyAndroids I love what Zack did but every movie should have it's own tone and that's what Shazam done...... But this stan with the snyder cut is getting ridiculous and our own hating on new dc..... gtfo and stop following DC period."
"4232","Of the two Captain Marvel movies or right now I have to say #shazam was the superior film. SHAZAM!"
"4233","Shazam! did that!!! My expectations were low but it SLAPPED"
"4234","Might go see Shazam just to watch the 5 minute preview for Godzilla"

"4237","just a heads up for those who haven’t seen shazam, i suggest you to not look at the shazam kids’ ig stories, they are sort of spoiling some parts of the movie ((some we have not seen it trailers))"
"4238","Believe it or not Shazam and Wonder Woman are the top 2 DC movies <U+0001F3A5>"
"4239","@Daddyphatsnaps SHAZAM! Now this is epic!!"

It’s partly cloudy in the ATL...

I think I’ll get my tires changed, a smoothie, and either go bowling or to the movies #SHAZAM <U+0001F914> #Decisions"
"4241","@CinemaScore @ManaByte @ShazamMovie I hate that i can't support this movie cus ive already bought my endgame ticket. Hopefully this makes a shit ton of money and gets a trilogy greenlit @ZacharyLevi"
"4242","@Squiiddish For real see Shazam and not Alita again. For the tenth time."
"4243","Shazam is really really reallyyyy bad I won’t recommend it tbh"
"4244","@yourloyalpal @MarvelStudios Marvel has to give Shazam it's time before endgame destroys the box office"
"4245","Me watching #Shazam: This kid has real Seth Cohen energy

Me 70 min later: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"4246","@PaulGCornish Did he write Miracle Man as a result of not being able to write Shazam?"
"4247","@screenrant
this is serious? Do you really believe that Suicide squad is better than BvS? you are some inept people who do not have a fucking idea about movie
or you have been bought by ""someone"" this is so 'Pathetic'"
"4248","Shazam! Was amazing. Another great outing for DC. Quite enjoyable, will be seeing it many times again the future. Fun and I felt good at the end, not a expert on Shazam, but did seem to stick to source material well. @DCComics @ShazamMovie @jordanfunky @revrim @SuicideSquadcst"
"4249","I'm the person who gets to enjoy twice as many comic book movies because i don't care about sides. As a movie fan, i call that a win. #Shazam #CaptainMarvel #SuperheroMoviesRock"
"4250","@IamNagent007 @ffilmreviews You seriously need to back off and leave them alone. For god sake just go to the movies and watch Shazam again. Go do something constructive."
"4251","From the Superman headass cameo in shazam, WB &amp; DC obviously know how important he is. Idk why they’re even contemplating continuing without him. They can be good w/o him, but a great universe with him"
"4252","@DiscussingFilm @MTVNEWS DC characters do well in the hands of directors that love them. MoS, WW, Aquaman, Shazam are all examples. I'm not sure the Russos understand DC well... So NOPE."
"4253","Shazam and Wonder Woman seem to be turning things around at least, which is great, Marvel v DC rivalry is dumb I'd rather be excited for both series."
"4254","Seeing it tomorrow, I seriously can’t wait"
"4255","20 minutes early to my IMAX screening of Shazam. Should I take selfies?"

"4266","@Actually_Thanos Can you give Shazam salvation?"
"4267","@DCComics @ShazamMovie I am more hyped to see the Joker."
"4268","@MazeDaMouth Wasn't so impressed with captain Marv. Expected more.

Is it safe to see Shazam?"
"4269","The REAL Captain Marvel.
The alter-ego of Billy Batson, the crippled news vendor who became
the Man when he shouted 'Shazam!'.

Who can possibly believe that Marvel is a she? ... except perhaps youngsters
in the copyright business who think they know it all!"
"4270","Going to go see Shazam tomorrow. Yey cinema time!"
"4271","I'm waiting for my @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel and @Jgrazerofficial Wired Autocomplete video #ShazamMovie <U+0001F644><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>"
"4272","coming out of Shazam. I'm just on the past the aquala Reef episode of Love death and robots, and this is some of the best goddamn CGI I think I've ever seen so watching this right after I came out of Shazam which is a multimillion-dollar mainstream Blockbuster with CGI (3/4)"
"4273","#ShazamXbox my friend would have super vision. He is hard sighted, so seeing the world clearly would be amazing"
"4274","Shazam is a great story of someone chosen to be a hero because of their honor and then proceeds to act dishonorably for the rest of the movie."
"4275","So...I need to watch Shazam"
"4276","Does anyone want to yell with me about how precious Darla in Shazam! is?!? Because she’s the best!"
"4277","@ZacharyLevi #Shazam wow awesome movie. Young kids watching the movie were screaming. You are the best super cool super hero after a long time. The post credit aqua man gag is fantastic"
"4278","My friend would like to be Spiderman, as he can swing around the whole of any city you want!"
"4279","Watched Shazam and it was a fun movie.  Rate it 7.5/10. Suprised to see Adam Brody in it haha."
"4280","So DC's Shazam's Day 1 Domestic is 20m$ 

Marvel's Captain Marvel Did 61m$ on its Day 1.

DC fans were making videos to Not to watch CM and spreading Negativity on it. 

Backfired ?!"
"4281","I said Shazam was gonna suck and I’m tweeting this to admit I was very wrong because it was SOOOOO FUNNY <U+0001F602> and really good"
"4282","@beardedreviews_ @snyder_cut Superman would do it... Just him and Shazam has spats now and again.. the Cameo is cause they're planning a recast.. the Shazam movie also gives a shout-out to BVS."
"4283","If Billy Batson were real he'd laugh at the piteously weak 'anti-SJW' YouTube bros negatively comparing Captain Marvel to Shazam."
"4284","here at the theater to watch Shazam. 

after-action report to follow"
"4285","@MikeFreeman_817 Actually that’s my fav dc movie since Michael Keaton it’s the most comic accuracy besides #SHAZAM I really enjoyed #Aquaman thoroughly from story to effects to characters"
"4286","@JAYBlRDS Ah fuck, god no Shazam is great I need to see it, I need it to go up"
"4287","Thought #Shazam was superb. Very funny, engaging story and Zachary Levi was excellent."
"4288","@Bzappoz @Actually_Thanos shazam is dc <U+0001F612>"
"4289","@tmpowellmedia Shazam!  was really good!  Zachary Levi is hilarious!"
"4290","@reggiegotlag hey Jamal, so what did you think of #ShazamMovie ?"
"4291","Getting ready to watch Shazam, the real Captain Marvel."
"4292","@ZacharyLevi I just saw the Shazam movie and it was great. You were cool and funny all at the same time and you played it perfectly. Praying for a Shazam 2 keep up the great work!"
"4293","#Shazam had pretty much everything!  Full of feels, plenty of action, great story...
...and for about half the movie, the whole theatre was in stitches!"
"4294","Took my mom to watch Shazam in 4Dx and I can honestly say this was the best viewing experience ever <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"4295","I’m really going to face and go watch Shazam"
"4296","#Shazam was just a gay ol time. I had a ton of fun, I think I can give it a safe 9/10. The best DC film easy"
"4297","Cavill was obviously replaced to leave that 1 movie in his contract and not pay a lot of money.
But I will say, I would have prefered him being in Shazam 2, we didn't really get a proper meeting between the 2"
"4298","@ZacharyLevi Watching #Shazam is like watching Chuck all over again! Gets magical powers-doesnt know what to do with it.  Gets intersect-doesnt know how to do with it. Awesome!! Mad props!!"
"4299","i didn't expect that particular storyline in Shazam! movie. forget Justice League, only Shazam! is real <U+0001F609> there were some surprises but at least there was no Henry Cavill in Shazam! (not a spoiler)

Review: Satisfied. Ending could be better though"
"4300","@iNabberTV Fraser do you not get bored of superhero films? Like I’ll watch the big ones but I can’t be doing with watching every Shazam or captain marvel."
"4301","hey, @wbpictures @WarnerBrosUK have a look please. You've lost your loyal fanbase and that is clearly visible now. Shazam is standing at fucking 93% and it is falling below expectations everywhere. if you want to reinstate that faith then #ReleaseTheSnyderCut &amp; #ReleaseTheAyerCut"
"4302","Just saw Shazam in theaters.  It was totally awesome. #shazam"
"4303","@_jesuss323 @ShazamMovie Ok cool. Thanks bro. I’ll check it out then and let you know what I thought about it."
"4304","Now we know who the real captain marvel is"
"4305","Shazam is fun and it has a light storyline."
"4306","At the movies with a friend seeing Shazam"
"4307","@GyakutennoMeg Shazam was great BTW
The goofing off segment was a tad too long, but overall it was great"
"4308","@GyakutennoMeg DC really needs to get the Wonder Woman and Shazam teams together and figure out what they did right"
"4309","@donoDMG1 Shazam has more races in their movie than black panther...fact check me"
"4310","@celicainwhite Yes this one is uploaded! I'm about it watch Shazam in a bit but when I get home tonight this is the vid I'm buying! You probably could tell from the first preview you uploaded about the goth gf I was really WOW about it <U+0001F60D><U+0001F601>"
"4311","If you liked #Shazam and walk into a local comic book store looking for related material—and they don’t direct you to a stack of @JerryOrdway comics—leave immediately. 
That place isn’t worth your time."
"4312","@binkytoes I think we’re going to see Shazam. That looks friendly to a couple of 9yos <U+0001F606>"
"4313","And got tickets to this one tonight!!! 
Dang, I'm seeing a TON of movies lately... Someone give me something to do! Lol!"
"4314","The movies has always been a ""happy place"" for me. A place where I can just relax and be entertained without worrying about the real world for a bit. I love that I'm now able to share that experience with my son Jackson. #Shazam will be the latest father/son movie day spectacle."
"4315","Shazam is the most endearing, heart-warming superhero film I've seen. Unexpectedly good."
"4316","Warner Bros figured out a way to give us the Shazam family before a comic accurate Batman and Robin film <U+0001F62D>."
"4317","Happy Shazam day because i’m seeing Shazam today."
"4318","Shazam! Was such an awesome movie!!!"
"4319","all it took was 1 interview with zachary levi for me to know shazam was going to be amazing and i was RIGHT"
"4320","Bye guys
Have fun

Watch Shazam guys

Also
Watch Krypton It's streaming on the @TheDCUniverse"
"4321","I usually don’t care about box office, but I’m nervous for Shazam <U+0001F62D> I want a sequel so bad"
"4322","Trivia q: anyone know why DC Comics began to refer to their #CaptainMarvel as Shazam in the 70s? Also, share your Shazam collectibles if ya got em!"
"4323","@SinemiaApp hey folks I can't get any tickets online. Keep getting an error message and I really want to check out #Shazam today"
"4324","So @ShazamMovie was everything a superhero needs to be. 
Humerous, with ample action and lots of heart. 

Also it's preferable if the movie has loads of @ZacharyLevi <U+0001F60D>"
"4325","#Shazam was great entertainment, a very funny and enjoyable film, edges out wonderwoman as the best DC film since since The Dark Knight Rises"
"4326","aw man just finishing Shazam and I'm really glad they not drop the tracklist cuz damn I will miss sum food"
"4327","@stargazer0118 I'm seeing #Shazam next week. I'm really looking forward to it."
"4328","Finaly a DC movie that we all deserve! Go do yourself a favor and watch #SHAZAM. It’s SHAMAZING!"
"4329","Finaly a DC movie that we all deserve! Go do yourself a favor and watch #shazam."
"4330","So, Shazam was the movie I needed today. I really hope DC are on the right track again with this one. I skipped JL and Aquaman due to their mixed reputation.

Gonna watch The Crazies later"
"4331","Going to see #Shazam"
"4332","Shazam? More like, “The Must Watch Family Movie of 2019”"
"4333","@kirkneverdied I kinda separate them. Like Justice League is personally the movie that I enjoyed the most in the DCEU,but I think Wonder Women,Shazam,Aquaman and Man of Steel are better made films."
"4334","@ZacharyLevi I saw it Thursday night! It was everything I was hoping it would be and loved every moment!! #Shazam"
"4335","I'm sorry i can never see this word without hearing it in Gomer Pyle's voice"
"4336","Shazam May be coming in lower than I expected but thankfully high enough to still call it a success. Good. Go see it. Really fun movie"
"4337","About to say the word... #Shazam"
"4338","@liberalnotlefty Shazam has a bit of 80s PG rating feel, a la Gremlins and The Goonies. There are some grey areas but nothing kids aged 10+ shouldn't be able to take."
"4339","Hey so remember Shazam? Yeah, it’s still a thing... and it’s pretty useful. So many radio stations around Canada use it for their countdown shows, some even have “top ___ songs on shazam” segments. Want to know more about supporting @BTS_twt on Shazam? Check out @BTSonShazam <U+0001F49C>"
"4340","@NateHood257 But yeah, Aquaman and Shazam are going places Marvel just hasn't"
"4341","@NateHood257 Yeah, Shazam was a complete thrill.  Outside the really dark villain stuff that felt out of place, the film was just fantastic"
"4342","@StillCrankyAF @DeebsFLA @PJMedia_com I predict the real Captain Marvel, Which is Shazam, will take this women’s lib film to the cleaners!"
"4343","billy ray cyrus is micah bell"
"4344","guys shazam! is great, there were laughs and action and heart and now to get beer nd burger"
"4345","@ponysmasher You probably won’t see it but I went to see Shazam today with my little sis( I don’t usually take her with me) because because she was adamant on seeing it and she loved the film a lot and had a smile throughout her face. Thank you David for this delightful film!"
"4346","That’s a shame, I quite liked Shazam  hopefully it earns enough to warrant a sequel. I wanna see Darla more <U+2639><U+FE0F>"
"4347","I'll be watching #Shazam today, read a review from a critic I respect a lot and said it was dumb...hope is not in the end"
"4348","Hey Geoff, I know that you're going thru the process of revealing what Shazam should be called in the comics. I have one for you. In the Shazam movie, Sivana kept referring Shazam as ""the Champion ™©"". That could be Shazam's public name! Whaddya think?"
"4349","Walked into #SHAZAM with an open mind. Walked out happily that they gave my favorite DC character props. Film gave me so many laughs while still bringing the action. #DC has their blueprint now. Don't mess it up. Character and stories before world building connections. <U+0001F44D>"
"4350","@AllyMsOldWallet @RussWBrookFan0 @Superman0621 @wbpictures Aquaman and Wonder Woman are another type of movies and more appealing like I said Shazam. It is an unknown property outside of the United States but I really hope Shazam will get success it derserves."
"4351","@SHAAN87989064 @GiteshPandya Your dumb as hell Zachery Levi had always defended Captain Marvel and you have nothing to do to shit talk Shazam ?! Grow up and be better show some positivity like Levi."
"4352","@BurnettRM @ROBSERVATIONS2 @TBurnettwork Is it a Shazam spoiler discussion, because I haven't seen the movie, or just your thoughts, no spoilers?"
"4353","@ZacharyLevi ww and Shazam are o f f i c i a l l y my favorite DC movies"
"4354","Over all, there's no superhero movie quite like #SHAZAM 132 minutes with lots of fun, laugh, emotion, and full of surprises.

And there's 1 mid-credit scene and 1 after-credit scene, just wait for it. 

Personal Rating: 4.5/5"
"4355","Now y should i watch a puffed guy in #costume ??? With a ridiculous combination of all #Superheroes #superpowers 
#DC #SHAZAM #2019 #MOVIE"
"4356","The best #Shazam review out there"
"4357","Going to see Shazam at 10:40, because I'm insane."
"4358","I have a fair amount of free time today, and I feel like I should go see SHAZAM because I hear good things, but I am lacking motivation. Motivate me to see SHAZAM?"
"4359","Shazam is the Speed Racer of 2019"
"4360","Shazam! is the Speed Racer of 2019"
"4361","@KreekCraft Going to watch Shazam"
"4362","@DoctorRagnarok I’ve seen 3/4 of these and I agree with them. I think Civil War, Guardians 2, and Shazam are better than Spider-Man 2."
"4363","I recommended everyone to watch the better Captain Marvel film of 2019... Shazam! Especially those unfortunate enough, like me, who watched Justice League on its first week. They definitely learned their lesson! <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
DC's comeback is real! <U+0001F4AF>"
"4364","@WestCoastMdnitR @screenrant @Collider @BBCBreaking @cnnbrk @ActorsRedCarpet @Avengers @ShazamMovie @GMA @CBSThisMorning @HuffPost @nytimes tries to do a #Disney @Marvel superhero family movie but not enough punk or spunk for my generation feels like it was aimed at older group than myself an my friends #ShazamMovie #Shazam #CaptainMarvel #dccomics"
"4365","Guess who’ll see it soon?"
"4366","@SteveMcCandless would have invisibility!"
"4367","This sounds crazy, put aside supes and batsy and then put Shazam as the face of DCEU! This will work!"
"4368","Damn I still can't get over the ending of shazam truly one of the best got teary eyed!!!"
"4369","@StreakyOfficial @CinemaScore @ManaByte @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi That's just hogwash you can easily buy one more ticket"
"4370","Ross Butler is playing on Shazam too???????"
"4371","@TheCrazyAsshole @gavinfeng97 It’s not tho. And I was suprised by that. I expected to like Shazam more."
"4372","Idk what to feel about Shazam hahahahaha going<U+2708> marvel"
"4373","saw Shazam today

first time since Spider-verse that I felt like I could like superhero movies again"
"4374","Shazam! is by far the best DC movie out there. Completely better than Justice League."
"4375","@Mack46967496 @HailHydra1237 @GiteshPandya For a film that doesn't have the benefit of several billion dollar films, Shazam is doing quite well.  Again, they both can do well.  There's no reason why Marvel and DC can't both do well.  And if you think differently, you're part of the problem."
"4376","@alplicable Rehearsing my upcoming show, watching Shazam, and securing the bag"
"4377","@EricVespe @maxhwelll A lot of horror films aren’t for me as they seek to generate discomfort and fear. 

Shazam! Isn’t perfect but it does a pretty good job of balancing those scary moments with humor. It feels adult, but also accessible to a curious kid who loves adventure and story."
"4378","im out of shit things to tweet so go watch shazam (2019)"
"4379","Louie ""accidentally"" sending shazam spoilers in the gc"
"4380","#Shazam was amazing! The movie that is set off in the right direction promoting family, friendship and bromance values alike, with an incredible cast and full of entertaining moments to balance out all the touching ones."
"4381","Just watched Shazam and it's simply amazing. 
With the movies like Aquaman and Shazam DC Universe finally looking to get on the right track.
#ShazamMovie"
"4382","W/ the releases of Aquaman, Shazam, &amp; @jokermovie, it seems that DC is cleaning up its act."
"4383","Two things

Imagine a Star Wars movie directed by Zack Snyder.

Go see #Shazam"
"4384","@robcham maybe because Shazam is relatable, every human being dreamed to be a superhero. What Billy and Freddy did is exactly what our reaction if we can transform to Superman-like. This maybe also Shazam comics was very famous that it got the point that Superman was losing the popularity"
"4385","@ShazamMovie after watching it i have to say only one word OMG. It's give me vibes of #HP and #NARNIA."
"4386","At movies about to see #Shazam and the guy behind us is giving a Summer Movie preview"
"4387","@AdmiralHip How obnoxious were the kids? The trailers make them seem real real bad but I love Shazam."
"4388","Saw #ShazamMovie wednesday. What a fun and refreshing movie! My mom and I loved it. Great seeing #MarkStrong as Dr Sivana and @ZacharyLevi killed it as Shazam! Congratulations to everyone who worked on this movie! <U+26A1><U+26A1>"
"4389","So Shazam was really good. Horses placed first and third. Let’s hope tomorrow is as good for wolves and wrestlemania"
"4390","god i just wanted to fucking see henry cavill’s beautiful face in shazam.... but he knows superman so there’s THAT"
"4391","Great film. Light but never lightweight. Excellent introduction to the character, setting him clearly in the DCEU, fun with the right balance between comedy and action."
"4392","I wish you could Shazam cologne/perfume scents"
"4393","@QuailRepublic Yup already had brunch now I’m seeing Shazam"
"4394","Im so satisfied with shazam<U+26A1><U+26A1>! Good job. Love from malaysia <U+0001F495>"
"4395","Well I finished watching the movie #Shazam and it was comedic and somewhat childish <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>

But overall it's great. <U+0001F642>"
"4396","wait are there people complaining it wasn’t diverse???"

Personally I think Shazam did the teenager who is gleeful about being a superhero then the MCU Spider-Man but that's just me. I really like Shazam."
"4398","Still processing this movie lol"
"4399",".@ShazamMovie only @DCComics movies I've enjoyed in a long time 
#SHAZAM"
"4400","@kevinmsparks They have momentum, Shazam looks like a hit, aquaman was cool, joker movie even tho I was against it cause it isn't part of the universe, although I'm getting suspicious, wondering if this is a soft reboot on the joker, and Leto maybe pushed out"
"4401","I saw Shazam yesterday and i actually thought it was really good movie"
"4402","Shazam is a terrible movie. Not sure how it’s getting good ratings..."
"4403","And there's so many other things that I want to check out. Shazam, Pet Sematary The Tick, literally dozens of other shows and movies that I can't even keep track anymore. I've never jumped from show to show like I have recently."
"4404","I think my expectations for shazam was too high but it was a fun movie"
"4405","@ZachReino @washingtonpost God dammit, Zach. This one got me while I sit alone in this movie theater waiting for Shazam at 9:55 AM on a Saturday in April 2019."
"4406","We're with you after 6 for this week's Screentime where we're reviewing Shazam and Pet Cemetery. @PatrickGibson00 chats the OA and Dave Fanning picks his favourite movie"
"4407","@StormLord96 @gavinfeng97 Mcu fans always use the rotten tomatoes and review cards, so I will use it too now. Shazam 92% on rt, Captain Marvel 78%. The user score: Shazam 90%, captain marvel 59%"
"4408","Imax, but also @Avengers endgame. I've kept my eye on for shazam imax tickets for awhile and noticed the fix untill the day of release. Hell i even get alerts from the amc app to book tickets for avengers. So this all seems way to deliberate for it to be an accident."
"4409","@iNabberTV Should have kept Shazam / marvel family and the seven deadly sins for the sequel imo"
"4410","@sarahwhit10 @WeirdNPissdOff Whoever says Shazam was a copy of Marvel is hatee because DC doesn’t have any boundaries like marvel has .. that’s the reason y it’s hard pg13"
"4411","watch shazam, hellboy, dumbo and avengers: endgame with me pleaaase"
"4412","Lots of people saying that Pet Cemetery isnt good.. yanno whats awesome?? Shazam!"
"4413","Pet peeve when people wanna Shazam my music instead of asking then be all weird when they play it around me like idc just don’t be mad if that’s what we doing now <U+0001F974><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"4414","Hey ya’ll the GOAT just said #SHAZAM  is AMAZING! And you know what? He’s absolutely right! Go out and see it!"
"4415","@ihatejoelkim I spend too much time at KBBQ restaurants and just Shazam every song I like"
"4416","@SPICinemas is Shazam being screened with subtitles at S2 theyagaraja? Can see Sub marked at other SPI theatres"
"4417","My holy moly @ponysmasher #SHAZAM is a funny superhero movie that hangs on to the darkside.The cast is great in their role.The films atmosphere thrives on being colourful,a notable change for #DCUNIVERSE .
Sincere,joyful,exciting,everyone frm all ages can learn something frm this"
"4418","Thank you @ponysmasher for the masterpiece of a movie called shazam<U+0001F4A5>. Forgive me in excitement I couldn't find the lightening emoji.<U+0001F601>"
"4419","SHAZAM was...not terrible. But I'm bored with ""The Mediocre White Boy as THE ONE,"" especially one who breaks laws and gets a slap on the wrist. I also liked the diverse cast, but side-eye how they hid that shit in all promo. I guess they knew white folks ain't into diversity."
"4420","Shazam was most definitely the funniest DC movie I have ever watched"
"4421","So What Are We Going To Call The Family Now? Is It #Shazam Family?"
"4422","Sucks Shazam released so close to Endgame tho wish it dropped in March , I think we will get a sequel regardless tho as we should."
"4423","Everyone clowning the Shazam suit when it showed up but now nobody honestly notice that shit"
"4424","The expected result, but the best app there ever was probably deserves the recognition! Well done @Shazam!"
"4425","every theatre i’ve checked has been sold out SHAZAM is blowing UPPP"
"4426","PSA to the people watching Shazam this weekend, there are TWO after credit scenes! Make sure you stay until the very end of the credits!"
"4427","There was a brilliant Street Fighter reference towards the end of Shazam which was just fantastic @ponysmasher"
"4428","#Shazam was alright, but it felt more like a comedy than an actual superhero movie.  After this, I don't want to hear any DC fanboys/fangirls complaining about the one-liners in Marvel movies after this yuckfest."
"4429","As a Black Deaf award-winning filmmaker/creator, who has a script about the absence of POC/Black Deaf female superheroes representation on TV, we want to see people who look like us, sound like us and act like us on the screen. #representationmatters @netflix  @marvel @dccomics"
"4430","I refuse to give anybody song credit<U+0001F602> I’ll Shazam way before I say “aye what song is this fam?”"
"4431","@DCComics finally got one right with the new #Shazam movie! It was really good."
"4432","SHAZAM! is charming and lots of fun. I think it accomplishes what it sets out to do, leaning hard into the BIG meets Superman concept. That said... #ShazamMovie"
"4433","...along with a pinned note that explains exactly what’s up with said heart. #ShazamMovie"
"4434","...granting that, there’s one bold choice they make, that I really liked, and I also love the whole positive representation of a foster family... particularly against some darker depictions of biological family pitfalls. #ShazamMovie"
"4435","#Shazam was highly enjoyable. I loved it, solid 7.5/8. Darla my absolute fav and I didn’t expect *something* to happen but it made me really happy. Zachary Levi is my king."
"4436","""Why the heck were Shazam and Freddy playing Mortal Kombat X in the film? I'm so outraged!""

Number one, Mortal Kombat 11 isn't out yet, dingus.

Number two, Injustice 2 probably would've been a little...obvious.

Number three, IT'S A MOVIE. RELAX."
"4437","@KalenMcDavid26 I like it, I was surprised that they decided to bring out the Shazam family so soon"
"4438","@UPROXX @ShazamMovie @VinceMancini Y'know, I wasn't that arsed about seeing this right away but after reading the review I'm in."
"4439","I loved Aquaman and Shazam but both movies are pretty forgettable i mean people are still talking about MAN OF STEEL and and BVS i hope you get my point @wbpictures @WBHomeEnt #ReleaseTheSnyderCut #BringBackZack"
"4440","Yo @wbpictures I’m seeing Shazam in a couple of hours. Got a feeling I’ll enjoy it and then it’ll leave my brain almost right away (*cough* Marvel *cough*) but you never know. Know what still has ample space in my brain? Snyder’s Superman saga (incomplete). #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"4441","@ponysmasher I watched Shazam on early release weekend -  it was great!  I hope that Shazam will one day soon join within the ranks of Justice League, but only after we see the release of the REAL Justice League by Zack Snyder!

WB did so many wrong. Not your fault. <U+270C>

#ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"4442","@nerdfollowing I’d put aquaman at the bottom and based on the trailers, Shazam right beside it. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"4443","Updated DCEU rankings after --
#ManofSteel
#BatmanVSuperman
#WonderWoman
#Aquaman + #Shazam (first viewing-impression)
#SuicideSquad (Extended)

Now, I'm only most looking forward to #Joker, until we get the trailers to #BirdsOfPrey #WW84.
Also, #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, @wbpictures"
"4444","Omg awesome movie @ponysmasher Shazam was really funny I loved the movie #shazam"
"4445","@DeadlineNancy Is it bad for Shazam that it dropped in China? Do you think that it still could do well enough to get a sequel, or would Warner Brothers be disappointed in its gross?"
"4446","Thank you China. #Shazam deserves even less than it got."
"4447","@souljaalmighty @screenrant No. That what you wrote is trash. BvS is best comic book movie ever made, MoS 2nd best and best origin movie ever made, WW is only great movie from the rest of them. Aquaman and SS are mediocre, Shazam is just bad and josstice league is garbage."
"4448","@BlackMajikMan90 @NewTSage Nope. Wonder Woman is no.3 Aquaman no.4 and Shazam is worse than Suicide Squad."
"4449","@daamiedwards Good xD Shazam deserves nothing. Honestly it's worse than Suicide Squad. That ending is lowest point of DCEU."
"4450","Loving the energy here. #Shazam"
"4451","I’m trying go see Shazam or Pet Cemetery tonight but I cant decide which one"
"4452","Wow. Wow. Wow! #Shazam was incredible! I think DC finally is getting it right! I hope we get a sequel! @ZacharyLevi is the man!"
"4453","@CJLLonewolf @ShazamMovie Looking forward to seeing @ShazamMovie tomorrow. We have the same #1 and it’s really underrated."
"4454","I think this movie is up there as the best of the DC movies now it’s just so fun. I’d be very interested to see Shazam show up in other DC movies and interact with the more grown up heroes like Superman and Batman. Also the family message of the movie is great"
"4455","CRANKY but going to see Shazam this afternoon so hopefully not as cranky later"
"4456","At the movies with @lollygaggerco! #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"4457","#Shazam is amazing, full of heart. Thank you @ponysmasher @DCComics @ZacharyLevi for this amazing movie"
"4458","@CinemaScore @ShazamMovie Shazam better RT Score
Captain Marvel and Shazam tie CinemaScore
Captain Marvel more at Box-office 
Great showing for both movies."
"4459","@valleygrim @CastiRojas21 @Melvingordon25 Why would we claim that a movie is good only because it’s kid friendly lmao nah Shazam is one of the best CBMs I’ve ever seen"
"4460","@masteracestick @GhettoBoxMan @getFANDOM @Variety No he stated that Shazam made less money than Captain Marvel and I explained why <U+0001F644>"
"4461","I could barely survive 2 hours and 20 minutes of Shazam lol I had to pee for like half the movie (and I went to the bathroom a second before it started) so I honestly have no idea how my bladder is going to survive this one."
"4462","@fembrucewayne @NewTSage Well, they don’t. And Shazam wouldn’t be able to beat dr Sivana if it weren’t for the Shazam family. They saved the day (and many people’s lives) just as much as he did."
"4463","@sarahwhit10 @neontaster Or perhaps it just that DC needs to make good movies (Shazam is good) as Marvel does. The Marvel formula is that they make good movies that happen to share continuity, not that the continuity makes them good movies. No need to overthink this stuff. Just saying."
"4464","@Jesus_G_Reyes @ElCondimentKing  are we seeing Shazam at 10:45 or what"
"4465","So this is how I'm going to miss Dumbo and Shazam <U+0001F622><U+0001F622>"
"4466","Ok I'm in a bit of a pickle...I haven't gone to the cinemas in a looong time, so I thought I'd go catch one tomorrow...which one should I go for?????
A. Captain Marvel
B. Shazam
C. How to Train Your Dragon 3
I can't chooooose. Help please?"
"4467","I was dragged into doing that. Demi Shazam, and Nandos. 

#opportunist #liveforfood #foodislife"
"4468","i wish y’all realized how good shazam really is and got your asses out of your houses to see the movie. ughhh it deserves so much better!"
"4469","Just watched #Shazam  a good solid funny film. These DC films are generally getting better each time round. Keep it up! #DCComics #Shazam!"
"4470","I had so much fun watching #shazam. The original trailers turned me off but I went based on good word of mouth <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE>"
"4471","Interesting...

Looks like Shazam is doing very well, and didn't...

Have an agenda pushed by the lead actor.

Didn't complain about who was at press conferences.

Didn't do a gofundme for tickets.

As I said... Interesting.."
"4472","I am here for all the silliness, goofiness and camp of SHAZAM!!!"
"4473","#Shazam was really good. I'm not ready or willing to put it over Wonder Woman but its up there."
"4474","Excited to watch @ShazamMovie with my good friend @jay_magnant today."
"4475","@ZacharyLevi when I thought that, in 10 years, I couldn’t be prouder of you, I watch Shazam and the movie proves me wrong. Congratulations, my love! I’m typing this tweet with my feet because I’m using my hands to applaud you. <U+0001F49D> TELL ME WE’RE GONNA HAVE SHAZAM 2!"
"4476","Watched the first captain marvel earlier and what I can say it's too light, action packed, surprising! #Shazam"
"4477","shazam is such a funny, family, action-packed, etc. I don't know what to say this movie is such a perfection without those kids!"
"4478","Okay one thing , @ZacharyLevi the way you present yourself is just <U+0001F92F>. You talk with such passion in your recent interview in @TheView and your just generally such a beautiful and expressive person of the world and people . I honestly cannot wait to see @ShazamMovie tonight ,"
"4479","Yo! #Shazam was so good, my entire theater was having so much fun. Easy 10/10 for me. Definitely watching it again tomorrow .@ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @TheIanChen everyone did an amazing job. #DCEU"
"4480","@SuperheroSciFi Honestly I think it all depends on Shazam’s Box office, so it’s fluid"
"4481","@DCComics @ShazamMovie That was a bloody good film, even though the soppy bits were predictable. Curious cameo from Mister Mind in the credits scene, though, hope the story with him as the villain won't be as naff as they were in the older comics"
"4482","It was a bit last minute but I saw Shazam! last night and HOLY SHIT I loved it so much <U+0001F648> it 100% should’ve been a 15 rating instead of a 12, though. I was so unsure in the beginning but about half an hour in I was HOOKED <U+0001F64A>"
"4483","@gavinfeng97 @BoosterBronze I’m talking about Chinese market and wom.Shazam is flopping overseas(Korea,European ...)if you think WB don’t care about it,domestic market is enough,then ignore me<U+0001F44C>."
"4484","I'm more of a Marvel fan and DC movies are not my thing that much. I watch those movies but you never know what you get. The trailer might be awesome but then the movie might suck. In this case, Shazam! trailer was good and the movie was even better."
"4485","Thanks @ShazamMovie for making me freak out because of Faithe Herman, Cooper Andrews, Adam Brody and Ross Butler! I freaked out so many times because I didn't know they were in this movie!! Awesome movie btw, completely different compared to other DC movies."
"4486","Yes agreed Marc! I enjoyed the fun #Shazam had in store. Even rated it my number 2 DC live action so far but, diversity? The lead was a white Male, there was a physically challenged character, again white, and another white Male as the villain. #Spiderverse IS diversity!"
"4487","the flavour"
"4488","Father and Son time tonight... while Mommy gets her girls night out w/ Emily. #Shazam! #ramonroman"
"4489","Absolutely no one spoil this for me, but if the Shazam movie doesn't have a Talky Tawny gag in the credits I will actually arrange a hostile take-over of Warner Bros."
"4490","@ZacharyLevi Happy to support another former Buena Bulldog. Wishing you much success this weekend!! #Shazam"
"4491","I need a full movie day to go see Us and Shazam"
"4492","@K_Manzone @ryno1185 @boodad12 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie If the Joker’s mom’s name is also Martha in this upcoming film, I’m out."
"4493","Alot of people seem to think comic book Shazam would work better in his own world but I wholeheartedly disagree. I have a Shazam pitch that takes the whole ""Magic Superman"" insult/box ppl put him in and proves, DC needs Shazam."
"4494","I need people to watch #Shazam so I can talk about why I love it so much. It's been hinted at in spoilers talk but I need to go all in on this"
"4495","Shazam! Was really good. Not just in the scope of DC films or superhero films in general. I really like the direction they decided to go in overall. I don't wanna get into spoilers but I really enjoyed the final act."
"4496","Shazam feels like a whole lot of DC parody movie. Nice tho but comical"
"4497","@Superman0621 Makes sense, in terms of Henry having four movies in his new contract. Removing his Shazam appearance leaves room for a fifth"
"4498","""Some of the most horror-esque moments of any dc movie.""

""[The villains] were really violent.""

"4499","He would have the indestructible stomach, he can eat for days and still not get full or gain any weight."
"4500","@BobDigi69 I like how Shazam has some diversity, but SS definitely did a good job with that too."
"4501","@sarahwhit10 Okay, Shazam was good. But in no way was it better than MoS, BvS, or WW. It did have some horror elements, which was great, but that just makes everyone who bashed the “darkness” of the other films seem like hypocrites. This was a dark film with jokes."
"4502","Legend instrumental played for 15 seconds in Shazam and I teared up because I'm so proud"
"4503","shazam! being a loveletter to all dc superheroes and the idea that you can make mistakes &amp; don't have to be pure at heart to be a good hero.... you're allowed to be flawed. feels good, feels right!"
"4504","@HacktheMovies she probably doesn't want to put up with your boner"
"4505","Going to see Shazam!!!"
"4506","oomfs just full on posting shazam scenes"
"4507","Shazam was really cute. i internally screamed @ a certain casting i didn't know was happening"
"4508","**NOTE: There are 10 questions in total. The answers can be found in the mid/later part of this thread, so don't worry and be honest when you do the tests so that we know where ARMYs can improve!<U+0001F618> 

Q1. Do you know what Shazam is?

@BTS_twt #ShazARMYSchool #BTSBillboardTopGroup"
"4509","Shazam was a great film and I connected more with the story than any other DC movie to date. It should have been DC's Ironman (the kickstart to their DCU)."
"4510","Decided to get the #CaptainMarvel collector cup while watching #Shazam - really wanted the cup topper. Honestly I didn't do it to be ironic. I just like collecting cup toppers for my godson for him to play with as action figures."
"4511","Who are you and what have you done with the real Rayy?"
"4512","The magic train in Shazam being very obviously a TTC (Toronto) subway is funny. You just know there would have been far more delays getting to the Rock of Eternity."
"4513","@JFSculpts @rusty_game The magic train in Shazam being very obviously a TTC (Toronto) subway is funny. You just know there would have been far more delays getting to the Rock of Eternity."
"4514","In our town there is no SHAZAM"
"4515","Going to see #SHAZAM"
"4516","@iamadityajha1 I would say 500M+ by now, until we see how strong the WOM will make #Shazam’s legs."
"4517","@CarissaR_NG As the movie has cost only 85M to make, we are getting a sequel anyway, as it will hit the profit area next weekend already. #AntMan (which has cost 45M more than #Shazam) got a sequel crossing 500M globally. And 500M+ is even more profitable for a 85M movie than for a 130M one."
"4518","@AmineDiv @iamadityajha1 That’s why I said that we need to see how strong Shazam legs will be. If they are strong to make the movie grossing well until the Easter holiday weekend (that brings lots of money to the #BoxOffice in LatinAmerica, US and Europe) it would give a last boost before EndGame arrives"
"4519","Shazam was everything I could hope for. Thanks @ZacharyLevi can’t wait to meet you in a couple of weeks!"
"4520","@JerryOrdway @ShazamMovie I bought it digitally this week, although I have an original hardback copy somewhere. I vividly remember your book, and Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake's earlier ""Shazam: The New Beginning"" which both sparked my love for this character. The movie is my childhood brought to life!"
"4521","I’m not answering this. But Shazam you could go away"
"4522","Let's if Tumblr is freaking out over Shazam."
"4523","the people who are comparing shazam with deadpool disgust me."
"4524","my locals heavily oppress shazam everyone is refusing to go with me streaks"
"4525","I think his power would be phasing. @Ragnall_Ivar  #Shazam #ShazamXbox"
"4526","Psyched out of my mind to see Shazam today.  Anyone see it yet before I head out?  Good?  Great?  @JohnnyObeid @rapsfan1237 @DistrictMamba @funnydanny"
"4527","I really wish I had a theater within ten miles of me that was showing #Shazam. In the mood to see it again, but not in the mood to drive 30 miles to do so."
"4528","Just watched Shazam and it was amazing. Would recommend 10/10."
"4529","Shazam opening with Ant-man numbers is pretty bad since it won't enjoy the same summer legs and Endgame is going to be a box office black hole. Hopefully, costing $40M less will offset it. @jburd22 @MurrellDan"
"4530","9/10 - very funny and charming movie. DC really made a good one! hope to see more quality stuff like this!"
"4531","Saw Shazam last night. Enjoyed it. Especially liked the focus on foster care &amp; ""the twist"""
"4532","haha fuck yeah this song is a banger

I love pop radio! They also played some twenty one pilots in shazam! it delayed my bathroom break

when i came back i didnt like the movie anymore*"
"4533","@my_wasted_years @White_espada all recent DC comics movies sucks... except #shazam"
"4534","Just went to watch Shazam! at the cinema and I found it incredible. Loved the way @ZacharyLevi played Shazam, made me laugh throughout the film <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> <U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C>"
"4535","I wish there was a way to get #paddyspub in the sequel to Shazam. That would be true world building. @GlennHowerton @ponysmasher"
"4536","@ZacharyLevi Just saw Shazam yesterday with my kids. Far and away the best DC film of all time. Fantastic action intermixed with great laughs. #jackdylangrazer and you have fantastic comedic chemistry. Just wow! Anyone who hasn't seen this, go now! #shazam"
"4537","Saw #SHAZAM last night and I think maybe its the best DC movie so far to be made in the DCEU. Its very different, refreshing, funny, superhero movie nothing feels forced. Also Chuck plays a very good Superhero."
"4538","Joker and Shazam haters. Marvel has people up its ass so bad it's sad. Smh. See it. <U+26A1>"
"4539","My favorite out of the new DC movies. Such a delightful watch! #Shazam @ShazamMovie"
"4540","so proud of @SethEverman for his first ever major movie role as the villain in Shazam, what a feat"
"4541","@ashchanchlani @ponysmasher It looks like every single film is Epic and fucking masterpiece for u
I have watched shazam and it's not that great..yes it's a good movie but nothin epic bout it
#Unpopularopinion"
"4542","You telling me that @Panthro5000 is throwing out Battle Arena Toshinden references ON THE FLY in this #Shazam review? In the year of our Lord 2019? @AllPodsMatter do not play around"
"4543","@UngkarS @BatmanMeer1989 @TigerJiuJitsu @ArjunRe20194705 @gavinfeng97 Comparing captain marvel to Shazam ha totally unfair Capt marvel is like a prequel to end game. Shazam just doesn't need a big chunk of money to be hit. 500 mil + will be good even if China underperforms"
"4544","@the_snarkmaster @Kal_Somuah @MSherryprince @SHAAN87989064 @gavinfeng97 C'mon both are good but the feel good factor and some hilarious moments give Shazam the overall edge"
"4545","@TigerJiuJitsu @UngkarS @BatmanMeer1989 @ArjunRe20194705 @gavinfeng97 People will not watch end game more than once lol coz of all deaths it has Shazam has a chance to stay at second"
"4546","@Sujay_22jan @TigerJiuJitsu @UngkarS @BatmanMeer1989 @ArjunRe20194705 @gavinfeng97 LMFAO do you expect them to watch the movie again and again ? Can't they buy tickets for their family or friends. It will be good imo cash and grab but Shazam will have strong legs due to word of mouth"
"4547","Saw #shazam yesterday, amazing time and very authentic emotional movie."

"4559","Only two real complaints with the movie. Didn't really get a dramatic Shazam! moment. The setup was there for the rooftop scene and THAT scene, but they didn't take it. Still works beautifully though, just would've been brilliant if they'd made it more dramatic and visual."
"4560","Ranking the DCEU movies would be such an injustice (pun unintended). There are only tiers. Here's my updated dceu list

God level/masterpiece:
MoS
BvS

Great fucking movies:
Wonder Woman
Aquaman
Shazam

Misfired/bad movies:
Suicide Squad

That's it. Those are the rankings.

#DCEU"
"4561","But that's it. And that's literally nitpicking. The rest of the movie was incredible and ADORABLE. Some really beautiful scenes at the start of the movie and towards the end. Can't wait for the sequel and then Black Adam and then Shazam vs Black Adam ft. Superman. #Shazam"
"4562","#Shazam is awesome! David Sandberg is AWESOME! Billy's childish innocence and Dr. Sivana's ruthlessness were perfect in this movie. It's unbelievable how Sandberg managed to balance both the elements while making sure the movie has such a big heart. Absolutely LOVED it!"
"4563","Shazam has the best costumes of any superhero movie ever"
"4564","You can go to the grocery store for that"
"4565","Shazam! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>
Lovable characters.
Tons of funny moments.
Sets a completely different tone for DC, the most lighthearted so far.
A great coming of age story.
It got heart.
Has that 90’s Spielberg vibe to it.
The villain was boring.
Overall, a must watch for superhero fans.
8/10<U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"4566","If you're on the fence about seeing #Shazam, then get off the fence and go see it! I don't know why you would even be on a fence.. Seems really uncomfortable but if you're standing on the fence, you sound very talented, but no matter. GO SEE SHAZAM! IT WAS FANTASTIC"
"4567","@LionelStark91 @pumpumcorbasi @MenuManga Shazam is actually a fucking amazing movie and is better than a lot of MCU movies."
"4568","@EscaflowneClown I know you didn't, I'm just saying in general. If Shazam! fails, DC/WB might go back to that terrible horrible Snyder verse and NOBODY wants that. WB might start interfering in Wonder Woman 1984 ... Shazam! has to succeed so WB can commit to a change in course for DC movies."
"4569","Watched #Shazam yesterday, highly recommend it if you enjoy light hearted and fun movies. It reminded me of #AntMan, which IMO is a good thing. It also breaks the norm of #DCEU movies had for most, if not all movies, which are super gritty and cold."
"4570","@laurahhorsfall To be honest, I think this is mostly okay, and the majority of 9-year-olds will probably LOVE Shazam. I would have loved it at that age for sure. I'm just saying, the complaint that parents need a warning is silly when there's already a whole warning system in place."
"4571","It’s rated PG-13. That IS the warning. The monsters are pretty intense but I doubt it’s 14-year-olds who are having issues."
"4572","Catching #Shazam at 12:10pm, pretty god damn excited."
"4573","#Shazam looking to strong arm the box office. A great family and action film. @dutchmccalister gave it 4.5 out 5 <U+2744><U+FE0F>s what will @JPierceO say about next week?"

"4575","@DiscreetLatino @AndyRockCandy It was honestly the way to go because most people think of the character as Shazam anyway, since it was the name of the TV show in the 70s."
"4576","Cooper Andrews should’ve been casted as Pedro in Shazam/super hero form. While D. J. Cotrona should’ve played Victor (Cooper’s role). Just saying..."

"4608","@TheFunSizeGuy A peak and nearly perfect DC film. Shazam and Doom Patrol are on top! DC has step up their game."
"4609","@BurnettRM For those that think online ""trolls"" don't want diversity, I give exhibit A on it done right. In SHAZAM! the foster family truly cover the spectrum. No virtue signaling needed. They didn't exist to be stereotypes,  they were well rounded characters that served a story."
"4610","@ZacharyLevi We finally, after waiting for so long, went last night! Absolutely fun movie! Loved it! #Shazam"

"4619","Hugh Jackman really didn’t have to appear in X-Men First Class and Apocalypse and yet he did. 

RDJ and Chris Evans appeared in a Spider-Man film mainly produced by Sony.

But Cavill couldn’t appear in a #Shazam film firmly set in the DCEU and ""produced"" by his agent ? Lol."
"4620","I love #Shazam and I plan on seeing it again but somebody fucked up !"
"4621","@funkofinderz @ShazamMovie I really enjoyed it. It was intentionally campy at some parts, but truth be told I thought it was better than Captain Marvel... <U+0001F62E> #hottake"
"4622","@lottalosten @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher The movie was great and the acting spectacular <U+0001F44C>"
"4623","Shazam/aquaman vs Captain Marvel feedback is proof that people are pre-programmed toward DC and they always give a pass to Marvel. Marvel is the Apple of movie where they can release any average movie and people would go crazy."
"4624","@SonofBaldwin I especially hate the trope because “the one” is usually reluctantly so.

My Black ass gotta watch a white kid gripe over having powers or a grand destiny for 45 minutes (not specifically talking about Shazam. I had this thought most recently with the latest Kig Arthur film)."
"4625","Ranking Shazam over Wonder Woman? You’re confusing being more fun and having more comedy with being a better movie."

"4627","@GWF_1987 @NewTSage @ShazyReplicant There is good way to have diversity in films and they are bad ways to have diversity, Shazam is definitely in the group of a good film with diversity."

"4629","Just sitting here thinking bout @ponysmasher making the perfect film with Shazam. Something people aren’t talking enough about though is how @benwallfisch wrote the most bombastic superhero theme since William’s Superman. I’ve listened at least 50 times since Thursday."

"4633","I honestly want to hear yms’s opinion on Shazam. It’s definitely not his thing, but I’m wondering if he’ll see it as a better spin on current day super hero movies"
"4634","As a fandom we should work together and stream, shazam and request the new song as much as we can!"
"4635","#Shazam is one of the best superhero movies ever. Stop what you’re doing and see it. I’m a DC marketing guy now apparently but whatever. It rules. Adventure, fun, heart. What a comicbook movie should be, not some dour “gritty” slog."
"4636","I decided to see Pet Sematary over Shazam yesterday and besides feeling extremely light headed for a good 15 minutes (I cannot do gore at all) it was a really good movie 7.5/10"
"4637","@StormLord96 @TheCrazyAsshole @gavinfeng97 shazam is a great movie while cap. mar. waste of money(i regret watching it)"
"4638","Little known fact: Shazam gets his abilities from 6 god-like powers

S- Strength of Rattata
H- Heroism of Rattata
A- Athleticism of my Rattata
Z- Zestiness of my Rattata
A- Adorableness of my Rattata
M- Magic of my Rattata"
"4639","that bit at the end of Shazam when ""spoiler"" turns up was a bad decision though. It felt cheap and tacky, a scene like that needs to be earned. it also goes down the power and responsibility line but does it differently to Spider-Man."
"4640","something is really wrong with WB/DC. Shazam is about a superhero who actually enjoys being a superhero and doesn't whine about it. It's fun too. Someone is definitely getting fired."
"4641","and the bad guy is a well rounded character, genuinely bad and a genuine threat, but his CGI henchman were a bit crappy.

#Shazam"
"4642","My reality had Oscar Meyer not Oscar Mayer, Berenstein Bears not Berenstain, Vader said “Luke, I am your father” not “No, I am your father, Forest said “Life is LIKE a box of chocolates” not “Life IS a box of chocolates”, and Sinbad most certainly played a genie named Shazam!!!"
"4643","@RobertGarciaLB Not really

That Superman cameo in #Shazam showing they have no interest in taking Superman seriously or using Cavill and letting that freak James Gunn make a movie for them shows that pleasing DCEU stans is the last thing those assholes would ever want."

"4646","didnt get why the bullies in shazam picked on a disabled foster kid. realistically at their age (looked around 17) they wouldve just been smoking weed/cheating on their girlfriends. the plot was also weirdly religious too. it pissed me off how nice the foster dad too — my review"

"4692","Me and ThafBeans are on our way to watch Shazam, you guys gonna see it? I’m genuinely really excited for it. Will deffo record a @_CoffeeClub about it"
"4693","Came to watch Shazam. It was supposed to start at 1:20. I hate Creekside Cinema."
"4694","Shazam is somehow more schlocky than Aquaman but it commits to it and it's actually pretty fun. Ain't half bad."
"4695","Further proof that reviews don't matter. Even though Shazam got far better reviews than Green Lantern's 26% score on RottenTomatoes, it made less Friday and will probably make less in its first weekend... and that's with 8 years of ticket price inflation, too!"
"4696","@teambrady Sure, but Shazam also includes previews two weeks ago and on Thursday night, which weren't in existence when Green Lantern opened"

"4702","I was just wondering: if #Shazam flops or grosses below studio expectations, will people blame #ZackSnyder and #BatmanvSuperman for that too?"
"4703","I'm one of those  who genuinely like the Justice League movie we got.  But it could have been so much better.  The reason I rate #Shazam above it is because it had better drama and villains.  Shazam has some very scary moments.  The Parademons in JL should have been more like it."
"4704","@JLUPodcast thanks.  And the Billy Batson personal story with his mom was heart-wrenging..  it really broke my heart. <U+0001F622> So despite all the humor,  #shazam had some powerful drama.  And Dr Sivana was better developed than Steppenwolf and his Parademons.  Hopefully WB learn from this... #DCEU"
"4705","@caramelwings Shazam is some application is movie related to that?"

"4708","Saturday update: #Shazam opens w/ strong estimated $20.5M Fri (Includes $5.9M from Thurs); On track for $53.7M opening weekend. Kids giving it solid 72% recommend; General audiences give it 61%. (Aquaman scored 89% / 82% respectively). More accurate totals Sunday."
"4709","Overseas, #Shazam doing well w/ an estimated $29.2M on Friday -  But China numbers are lower than expected: -36% Fri-to-Sat drop. Western humor + competition having an effect. Opening China weekend could be $35M."

"4723","@snyder_cut @Trevor56510778 @MSherryprince @gavinfeng97 You idiot. Shazam was made on a really low budget so at the end of the day it will be more profitable than Justice League even if it makes 400-500 M worldwide"
"4724","@Minato01 @TigerJiuJitsu @UngkarS @BatmanMeer1989 @ArjunRe20194705 @gavinfeng97 Lol. There is no way Shazam will be 2nd after 3 weeks.

"4735","Shazam ended and you guys were GONE"
"4736","Go out and see Shazam! What a film."
"4737","Shazam was awesome. Best parts:
1. The entire board of a company was killed by the 7 deadly sins
2. A guy who was in my college orientation group was one of the superheroes and I died laughing when he showed up on screen"
"4738","#Shazam was super cool. Love @ZacharyLevi performance.. it brings back much wanted brightness to DCEU. (Not the way Joss wheadon tried to force it out in JL) Knowing JL wont happen again with Affleck and this Shazam is killing me inside."
"4739","@karimss @ShazamMovie Yeah. It's a very well researched documentary about how the app was conceived, coded and it's out of the roof popularity. Must watch."
"4740","I was pleasantly surprised by Shazam"
"4741","@meracvrry Literally never!! Lmao “Shazam is pretty diverse wow”

"4747","@Halloween_1014 @AMCTheatres @ShazamMovie I thought from the earlier trailers it would be “goofy” but it was very solid. Great mix of comedic tone with  a fun adventure sprinkled with some dark elements. Def go see it."
"4748","Found out that Shazam is PG-13 and I hate that. Billy Batson should not say fuck. Not even once"
"4749","As for the movie shazam! itself, i think my feelings are mixed. Too tongue-in-cheek for my taste. The movie felt out of place compared to other dark and less comical DCEU movies. There are moments that are genuinely funny but some parts are too draggy and annoying."
"4750","So i just finish watching shazam. There was a family with three kids sitting to my left. The two older kids were well-behaved but the younger kid (maybe around 3 or 4 years old) kept talking throughout the movie. Rasa macam nak balun je budak tu semua benda dia nak tanya"

Couple that with the fact that most normies don't know about Shazam! It's silly to compare its box office with a marvel movie. MCU has 10 years of backing behind it"
"4760","@itssan17 @snyder_cut @LazyAndroids Shazam was not cringy. You can't expect kids to talk philosophically like Batman and Superman. Also there were 2 or 3 dark scenes, a consistent semi-horror tone and 2 VERY EMOTIONAL scenes. Now I understand why this movie is flopping. It's because of ""DC fans"" like you."
"4761","@itssan17 @LazyAndroids Also what C grade comedies? Shazam is the only funny one uptill now and it WASN'T C GRADE. It had more heart and better humour than any MCU movie. Infinity war sucked by the way."

"4800","Shazam was such a cute movie! I prefer my super heroes dark and brooding, but I really enjoyed the lighthearted nature of Shazam!"
"4801","@ZacharyLevi @ZacharyLevi saw it last night and loved every minute of it best besides ofcourse the movie was yelling out Shazam loud as hell when ever you did in the movie yep that was me and 12 other people in the theater lol."
"4802","So pumped to see #SHAZAM in a couple of hours! How are people liking it so far?"
"4803","the replies . . it STANK lmao yall just love to shit on dc movies by always comparing it to *"
"4804","Going to watch shazam with the family."
"4805","Wonder Woman not at #1. You know there’s really no flavor to this."
"4806","Check out this sweet Shazam t-shirt! We still have a few of these in stock, as well as the evil Black Adam version, so come get them while they last!"
"4807","A video I made went live"
"4808","Shazam has the cutest end credits"
"4809","Shazam movie looks horrible but it actually got decent ratings"
"4810","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Nah still not my fav superhero &amp; never will be. The Flash &gt; Shazam any day of the week &amp; twice on sunday."

"4816","@clintnats missing my dumb spies a LOT with all this shazam promo tbh"

Group twitter discussion!!! 

#Shazam"
"4819","Shazam's movie is really powerfull in concepts. Still dark as a DCEU stereotype, but i thinks the jokes are good enough."
"4820","Super excited for #Shazam tonight and pretending I don't have three essays to write."
"4821","Really looking forward to seeing #Shazam tonight and pretending I don't have essay due soon."
"4822","@CryptMidwest @AMCTheatres @ShazamMovie I hope that you guys enjoyed it and had a great time!"
"4823","Shazam was predicted to make 50 to 60 million it's opening weekend....it made 61 million before Saturday matinee showings. It may hit 80 to 100 million by Monday morning."
"4824","@kingteth Snyder Cut roster plus Shazam and Green Lantern.

#TomCruiseIsGreenLantern"
"4825","The trailer of Shazam looks absolutely horrible. My God"
"4826","You guys. Shazam was awesome. Surprisingly dark at times and very very funny. One of the best movie going experiences I’ve had in a while."
"4827","Am I the only one who didn't find that scene so scary as others are making it to be? That felt like a legit PG scene, not PG-13 at all.
Forget scary. Real horror's essence lies in unsettling and unnerving -- none of that either here.
Felt like a ""hooooly shit"" scene at best."
"4828","@pedroangelnsc It's not soft at all. That theme starts playing the very second Billy steps in as Shazam. You just gotta take the hint that Superman is coming once your ears catch that shitpiece playing."
"4829","With that being said I recommend parents of younger kids seeing it before taking them. 

Much darker than trailers led to believe with some scenes that may be scary/disturbing to little ones."
"4830","Took my daughter on a date to see Shazam, that movie was absolutely amazing! And as a real life foster parent I really appreciate this movie. our family is made up of all different backgrounds and situations and we are blessed  @ZacharyLevi"
"4831","@robbywarren93 @BrellRadio I did include the $5M in the Friday total. I don't expect many folks to go see it on Sunday. Shazam isn't an Avenger movie."
"4832","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Best movie ever made by Dc and @wbpictures everything in this movie is perfect love this this is my favorite movie made by @wbpictures up to date. And by the way haters go fuck yourself you dumbass"
"4833","@DCComicsKids @ShazamMovie Best movie ever...... Oh my god most realistic superhero movie ever please go and watch this movie.....
Best movie ever made by dc.
I m gonna give this Infinte <U+0001F31F>  out of 5 <U+0001F31F>. And haters suck this <U+0001F595>"
"4834","Shazam was pretty fucking funny tbh, but overall it was alright"
"4835","1. Seeing Shazam! in a few hours.
2. Feeling hurt and in pain at the moment. Relationships, love, and connection really are subjects that are hard on me."
"4836","@ZacharyLevi Saw it yesterday. It was top notch,TOP NOTCH! You brought the character from the pages to the screen perfectly, I hope you guys kill it at the box office! 

Bring on Shazam! 2!! 
(And yes I believe that should be the sequels exact title, followed of course by Shazam! 3!!!)"
"4837","@DCComics @ShazamMovie So now that he is no longer Captain Marvel how does he introduce himself to others? My name is...lightning striking, big explosion evrytime? Did anyone give that any thought?"
"4838","Shazam looks awesome and I will see it and probably love it. But the next person that says ""this is how comic book movies should be"" with some form of ""it's whimsical"" or ""it doesn't take itself seriously"" should be assigned Maus for their next review."
"4839","@nerdificent @enthusiamy Just listened to this, GREAT episode!  Off to see Shazam! for a second time!"
"4840","Going to see shazam!!!! Starts in 5 min"
"4841","@ElectroLightEDM Worse, when I Shazam some of them, they appear under the reposters name"
"4842","@VirajMohan10 @sidcontra @ShazamMovie Besti? U mean, beizzati? For this small thing? <U+0001F923><U+0001F923>"
"4843","@sidcontra @ShazamMovie lol. U r pulling my leg. I just saw trailer. <U+0001F61B>
I have lost interest in superhero movies, but this looks interesting."
"4844","@sidcontra @ShazamMovie Is it related to Shazam app? <U+0001F61B>"
"4845","@eesnihc @Josh2Gud4U There’s more races with a more prominent role in Shazam and then there are in black panther and that is in irrefutable fact"
"4846","@eesnihc @Josh2Gud4U So you’re telling me majority of Black Panther having black and white people means it’s diverse where is Shazam has a bunch of different races and they are all in the movie a decent amount of time, Yet black panther is more diverse because?"
"4847","@Paisano @EricDJuly @ShazamMovie won’t even come close to @captainmarvel in #BoxOffice sales. Hate to break the news to you. Also, @DCComics lost the trademark infringement case in a court of law. 

#GarbageTake"
"4848","About ready to watch the @ShazamMovie!"
"4849","@jtp_304 Aquaman and Shazam are proof they can do good... even though I've enjoy the bad ones as well"
"4850","“Inventively Funny.” #SHAZAM! Now playing in theaters!"
"4851","And as expected #Shazam was amazing! All the emotions wrapped into one. <U+0001F60D><U+0001F62D>"
"4852","Hmm interesting justification. Also, this still a ""H&amp;O"", but brought that vibe and align with a newer incarnation (and make a bridge in much better ways than JOSStice League) could make everyone excited. And for the 3 times i've watched the movie, that works damn well #Shazam"
"4853","YES, I want the Zimmer theme for this universe’s Superman. 

But note that Sandberg actively made/wanted an ode to “Amblin era” of films which featured a lot of John Williams.

If Shazam’s music is inspired by John Williams, then it makes sense to briefly use JW’s Supe theme. <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"4854","#ShazamMovie is really good! Very fun, with a genuine heart you don’t see often enough in modern blockbusters. A family film, but keeps the stakes up and isnt too light. Has a few twists that pay off well. Found myself genuinely smiling in the theater for the first time in awhile"
"4855","I have to say @ShazamMovie is spellbindingly good so very funny charming and touching. Do yourself a favour and go see it. #ShazamMovie #Shazam"
"4856","Who wants to go see Shazam"
"4857","My only complaint is there were some issues with the performancing syncing between normal and hero. It was a bit off, enough that I could notice it when watching. But, oh well, it wasn't too bad. Movie was still great!
#Shazam !"
"4858","Oh, and YES, this is by FAR better than the other Captain Marvel movie this year! This was a great, that was a passable at best! Go Shazam!
#OGCaptainMarvel
#BillyBatsonIsBestCaptainMarvel
#BetterCaptainMarvelMovie"
"4859","Like Wonder Woman, Shazam stalled a bit in the last act but was enjoyable overall. The most jarring thing was how much more mature the character behaved as Billy, it was like they’d originally decided he was 9 and then changed their mind. Good fun."
"4860","@ZacharyLevi I saw #Shazam on Thursday and loved it! It is the most fun movie I've seen in a long time!"
"4861","@EDouglasWW my info says that it actually made two million more on its opening day. i think shazam will wind up having a stronger weekend than GL did (GL dropped off majorly after opening day) based on positive word of mouth"
"4862","As an old-school DC fan (emphasis on ""old""), I always preferred the original version of Captain Marvel AKA Shazam from Earth-Z pre-Crisis. Not today's rebooted manchild version. But this movie got me to like THIS lighthearted version too. Great fun! Congrats to Zach Levy and DC!"
"4863","@ZacharyLevi I saw it last month! It was hilariously good with a lot of heart. 

#Shazam will have you crying with laughter, plenty of emotional scenes and great surprises too."
"4864","@Shlimhardaway Wakanda Forever been confused as to why Shazam is considered the best film for diversity"
"4865","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures This movie is starter for main course on 26th"
"4866","If @DCComics keeps making bangin movies like Shazam! and Aquaman @MarvelStudios May finally have some competition. Not to mention @TheDCUniverse Doom Patrol and Titans."
"4867","...more Philly things Shazam! does in movie you might not have noticed
- saves car crash victim on Lincoln Drive
- saves parking spot in Manayunk with lawn chair
- befriends Todd Rundgren
- sits in between Ed Rendell and Dan McQuade at Palestra
- eats dog poop during parade"
"4868","After seeing #Shazam these are my rankings of #DCEU movies.
1.  Aquaman
2. Shazam!
3. Justice League
4. Wonder Woman
5. Man of Steel
6. Batman v Superman
7. Suicide Squad 
BvS &amp; SS are both shit but BvS edges SS out due to the Batman warehouse fight and Wonder Woman in general."
"4869","Just finished my second viewing of #Shazam. It doesn’t dethrone Aquaman as my favorite DCEU movie, but I really dig it. It’s very heartwarming. I cried at parts both times I watched it. The movie feels like an early 2000s superhero movie (in a good way). I can’t wait for more."
"4870","Gonna try and resist watching Shazam until Tuesday unless I get bored"
"4871","Seeing Shazam on Tuesday <U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F601> gives me something to do next week"
"4872","what a stream we end on 8-3 not to bad. speaicl thank you to @TykeCK99  who again went way beyond today with bits much appreciated same with @TBoneCaponeOG  and Lia. All of you are to good to me we be back tomorrow when i get back from seeing Shazam. I let ye know what its like"
"4873","A man goes through a lot in this world today the last thing a man wants to do is come home to an enemy.

#RedPill #mgtow #SaturdayThoughts #Shazam"
"4874","Binged watched season 2 and 3 of #SantaClaritaDiet in less than 24hrs! I even had the energy to watch #Shazam in between. Feels like an achievement <U+0001F60F><U+0001F485><U+0001F3FE>"
"4875","@OliverMort I haven't seen shazam yet but I'm hoping it lives up to it. and doesnt just skate by with a wasn't that bad like justice league."
"4876","Going to watch #Shazam for my birthday!! I'm excited for a little more humor in DC films. I can't wait to see how well Zachary Levi performs!! #BillyBatson"
"4877","@OutOfOurElement @MrMoviesETC @cam_junge @bloggingfilm @kieatthemovies @miiiiikkkkeeee @isortofreviewit @raysflicks @The_MovieOracle @LetsGoToTheMov7 @SaltiredPopcorn @MoviesRun DCEU wanted to do what MCU did but in half the time, and it just felt rushed. MoS/BvS pacing and stories suffered greatly because they were scrambling for JL. WW and AM were ace, because they took their time and were stand-alone films. Got my fingers crossed for Shazam!"
"4878","Off to see Shazam tonight , 3 nights at the cinema this week , love a £4.99 film @vuecinemas"
"4879","About to watch #SHAZAM!"
"4880","i fucked with #Shazam and Zachary Levi was the perfect pick for that role"
"4881","Came here to say that I really enjoyed Shazam! movie <U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1>"
"4882","You know what @TheDCUniverse? @ShazamMovie was LOADS better than I thought it would be. @ZacharyLevi a FANTASTIC choice. Great job! Now...do it again."
"4883","Saturday afternoon at the Trafford Centre to watch Shazam! with Neph#2. The expense is eye watering."
"4884","#shazam was amazing. I would totally be ok if Aquaman, Wonder Woman and Shazam became the new Trinity for a while."
"4885","#shazam is awesome. It's a fun, light hearted story about a hero who learns as he goes. Good villain, good respect to the source material while changing a few things. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it, it is definitely worth it."
"4886","@AnxietyFC get that weed and be shazam yourself brother how is this even a tough choice"
"4887","Just finished watching SHAZAM <U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+0001F603><U+0001F603> great movie love the music in it!!!!!! Also great message behind it about family. Everyone should see it this movie !!!!!!!!!"
"4888","@IGN Whose idea was it to put a spoiler in a headline for Shazam!? (DC cameo) I haven’t logged in to Twitter in years and had to download it onto my phone to voice my displeasure. Cut it out."
"4889","There is a scene, a kid drops Batman and Superman and looks in awe of the new superhero. Shazam got into place, it fun and entertaining. Loved the movie."
"4890","send me pictures of the Shazam cast"
"4891","Ok, so now that it's open to the public: SHAZAM, AM I RIGHT?!?!"
"4892","If you had one superpower, what would you pick? #Shazam in cinemas April 5"
"4893","@sleazyparrot Shazam a song playing in the movie shazam."
"4894","Power Rangers, Suicide Squad &amp; Shazam all had diverse cast that definitely weren’t advertised day-n-night as greatest thing to happen to cinema since talkies...they all deserve praise &amp; recognition for being just as they are diverse films that show how we are stronger together"
"4895","Im so lovin all the great response to @ShazamMovie .. i need to see it again! And again...and again...<U+0001F601><U+0001F49C><U+26A1>"
"4896","Shazam! cast and crew have made a really good superhero film. Bright, colourful &amp; brilliant fun (and a wee bit daft - which is a good thing). With Aquaman and this, DC are matching the quality of their TV output (Supergirl, Flash, Legends, Black Lightning). Proper entertainment."
"4897","@1JohnLivesay @aaronlopresti @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @ErikJLarsen @LetsTalkCM @DCComics @geoffjohns @sterlinggates How’d you get your hands on it? I have a few of the 1950s Marvel Family ones, but they’re in pretty beat up shape."
"4898","getting ready to see shazam only for tøps song in it lmao"
"4899","@cineworld went to see #ShazamMovie this Afternoon &amp; was a bit disappointed. It took too long setting the scene and the best bits are all in the trailers. Tries to be like #Deadpool &amp; #GOTG but not in their league. 6 out of 10."
"4900","I would really appreciate it if everyone went and saw Shazam and it made a shit million $. Like, really Iron Man this sucker. Then he ends up being a/the major player in the DCEU and then, normal people like my parents will have to know things like who Uncle Marvel is"
"4901","Not super related but every time I tell someone to ""See Shazam"" it comes out ""She Sazam"" and like...I speak for a living"
"4902","The best joke in Shazam! for me and only me was a Watch_Dogs hacking reference."
"4903","@reggiegotlag Replace MoS with Shazam and you got it."
"4904","@reggiegotlag Shazam actually embraces the color and fun of the characters and doesn’t have its hero snap the neck of his villain. It also has a cohenernet story, unlike BvS, and has a script that doesn’t have an explosion that leads into an action scene very ten minutes"
"4905","#Shazam is amazing. Loved every minute if it."
"4906","Using “Shazam” while watching Shazam just to figure out the title of a song. #dccomics #shazam #justforfun #amazingmovie @ZacharyLevi @DCComics @TheDCUniverse"
"4907","Dude, if I had and it had worked!"
"4908","@WinFamBusiness Yes pet seminary  and shazam started Thursday night so. And then avengers on season finale night so that hurts ratings too."
"4909","I honestly think Shazam is the best origin story super hero movie. Made me feel like a kid who used to imagine having super powers all over again."
"4910","That one scene in Shazam that brought out the Bisexual in me."
"4911","Oh btw Shazam is soooooooo good. A Deadpool version from DC imho"
"4912","Shazam was amazing for real it’s a great movie probably DC’s best movie I’ve seen till now"
"4913","@AngryJoeShow While Shazam was fun in a kid sort of way it wasn’t that good and felt like a over correction was too light. And not in a good way."
"4914","Trying to slander Shazam? Lmao. Whatever they’ve paid you, it’s not enough"
"4915","@airyapricity omg please tell me how it is. trying to decide between that and shazam to see tomorrow"
"4916","Seated for movie #1 of our double feature day: #Shazam!"
"4917","When more and more ppl watch Shazam, I hope fans will listen and understand when disability activists bring up the ableist aspects of Freddy's character. I thought Jack was adorable and great as Freddy, but the criticisms will be valid and just listen and don't get into fights ok"
"4918","Imagine being this dumb"
"4919","#Shazam was a REALLY fun movie. Funny &amp; had a lot of heart. The action scenes were really freaking cool too. Great job from @ZacharyLevi .Glad to see him on screen again. Can't wait to see the next one!"
"4920","#Shazam was a REALLY fun movie. Funny &amp; had a lot of heart. The action scenes were really freaking cool too. Great job from. Glad to see him on screen again @ZacharyLevi Can't wait to see the next one!"

"4922","the replies........ some of you don’t know what DIVERSITY means and it shows"
"4923","@ForeRumple @EricDJuly @ShazamMovie @captainmarvel @DCComics Foolish take. Movies aren’t judged by box office. Most great movies fail at box office and many money makers are terrible so enjoy your false victory LOL"
"4924","@LifeIn64Bit @NintenZ I honestly felt like Captain Marvel was really bland. The only things that really made it interesting were Nick Fury and Goose. Shazam on the other hand was really well put together in terms of story, and it was funny"
"4925","If you’re giving @ShazamMovie bad reviews it’s cause you don’t have a childlike heart. That movie is so funny. Can’t wait to see it again  #SaturdayMorning"
"4926","*Inigo Montoya voice* you keep using that word. I don’t think it means what you think it means."
"4927","Everyone is talking about the movie Shazam, I thought it was the app Shazam haha smh"
"4928","Sulking at all these people seeing Shazam while i'm housebound with this cold."
"4929","It’s always hard to predict what Chinese audiences will gravitate towards lol. Aquaman did so well and it seemed like a worse movie with less positive reviews."
"4930","can we hype up shazam more please"
"4931","I'm about to see Shazam, and this dude that's like 20 or 30 feet away from me in the theater is very loudly doing racist impressions, and I'm very uncomfortable"
"4932","@worldleader_12 @AngryJoeShow Maybe see Aquaman Wonder Woman and Shazam.

They left those vibes in 2016 with Zack Snyder"
"4933","Shazam was great. Polished 21st century superhero movie with 80’s movies feel. Made me think of Amblin, Goonies and Ghostbusters."
"4934","I’m so excited about seeing Shazam"
"4935","This is why Marvel is winning."
"4936","he’s the only logical one to do it"
"4937","Am out of Shazam"
"4938","Can we all talk about that ending?! How soon is too soon?!"
"4939","See if you think I can objectively separate my theater experience from my opinion of the film. Maybe questionable with this one!"
"4940","Captain Marvel is original name of Shazam but due Marvel Comics have its owned Captain Marvel DC Comics. Published their Captain Marvel under Shazam since the court battle long ago.."
"4941","While streaming the song, you should also shazam it! Shazaming songs also help increase a songs exposure!"
"4942","@SuperSuitShow @UpToTASK @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @Burn0321 @MrNiceGuy18_58 @JamesGavsie @MTFIII @RandyS0725 @SuperiorComic16 @SuperheroPOLL Love that pic!  Who tells Superman it’s going to be ok?  Shazam!"
"4943","i'm honestly blind with this whole dc marvel thingy but why is shazam real name captain marvel its so werid and why they have the same timing in the cinema"
"4944","It’s time I say that Aquaman was complete trash. Sorry. #SHAZAM is way way way better and it deserved a billion dollars that it sadly won’t get.
In fact surprisingly Shazam is in my top 10 comic book movies now <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"4945","@fantacapsblog @BrellRadio There’s no way it would’ve jumped from $10M to $25M, that’s like unheard of. 60% is still too much for a Saturday to Sunday drop. Most movies drop 20-50% on Sunday’s, Shazam will probably only drop 35%, if even that."
"4946","Just seen #Shazam . It was so good! Can't remember the last time I went to the cinema and laughed so much. Dark in parts but has great humour throughout."
"4947","Watched #Shazam yesterday and found it a decent movie @ShazamMovie @_PVRCinemas"
"4948","#Shazam finally a superhero movie that makes you feel like a superhero! #ZacharyLevi is amazing!"
"4949","Need to see Shazam, my son keep pestering me about it."
"4950","What happened bro?"
"4951","@thenerdyhub @Josh2Gud4U sir there are a total of 3 poc in shazam what are you babbling about"
"4952","Holy crap!!!!! @ShazamMovie is awesome. Best DC movie by far. It’s the movie Big if it was about super heroes."
"4953","Just continue the superman gone rouge because of lois’ death storyline from the dream sequence in bvs and bring the justice league in to take down superman along with SHAZAM!"
"4954","Happy to see that Shazam! is on pace for at least $50M. It should have pretty strong legs in the coming weeks, even with “you know what” coming out."
"4955","I want to see shazam explicitly because me and trents comics writing teacher showed us an episode of the original show every week"
"4956","Absolute must watch if you haven't already. One of the best episodes of JL:U"
"4957","So we've all walked into a theater that's says Dumbo on the outside, but I'm assured this is Shazam. 

Hold me. I'm scared. <U+0001F628><U+0001F418><U+26A1><U+2620><U+FE0F> #topsy?"
"4958","I am starting to resent how amazing @ZacharyLevi is. He had an awesome TV show in #Chuck. He’s a broadway star and a Disney “prince”. Now he is a genuine super hero. Color me jealous. Get to the @ShazamMovie ASAP and bring everyone you know with you."
"4959","@akasan @ShazamMovie I just watched @ShazamMovie absolutely worth it sorry @captainmarvel this one takes it for me! <U+0001F41D>"
"4960","#Shazam was so cute! And is probably my favorite DC movie <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"4961","@ZacharyLevi just saw Shazam, thank you for a wonderful portrayal of a hero I've loved for over 40 years...quite emotional for me."
"4962","@Steele131 I saw #ShazamMovie  has emotion in it unlike #CaptainMarvel which didn't contain emotion both movies are all right but could be better."
"4963","@sergioees Hopefully we see superman in #Shazammovie  2 or #Shazammovie vs #SUPERMAN"
"4964","If someone says that #Shazam is bad, call the local mental institution and report them to the FBI"
"4965","#Shazam makes me mourn for the potential the DC universe could’ve had if it had been handled correctly from the start. #ShazamMovie"
"4966","Shazam was pretty dope! It felt super Golden age, and DC finally gets that comedy really helps out. I neve checked out Aquaman but I probably should. They cribbed a bit of that Marvel formula but it really helped out. Let's see what you do next, DC."
"4967","Shazam: Lightning

"4968","@SuperheroSciFi @BlackMajikMan90 @TheComixKid They actually kind of teased Black Adam in Shazam."
"4969","So what's interesting to me about this whole thing is how Superman usually has a level insecurity we never see much of. Like the JLU episode with Shazam rests in part on him being jealous. Young Justice season 1 was similar."
"4970","Just watch Shazam and... I love it ! @ZacharyLevi is just perfect as Shazam !!! Now I want to be a superhero too <U+0001F602>
No seriously this movie is awesome, I laugh all the time ! #Shazam"
"4971","Go watch Shazam it’s the best DC movie and if it flops at the box office they won’t make another :-(((("
"4972","Going to check out Shazam today! @ZacharyLevi is a national treasure so I have really high hopes <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"4973","Shazam - a self-aware superhero film that's actually funny. Fairly light plot-wise, and a little overlong, but Zachary Levi absolutely kills it. 3 and a half stars."
"4974","Lol, someone else go see Shazam or Pet Cemetery and tell me if it’s worth it.  I’m tired of dropping my cash on movies not worth my time."
"4975","@apknightable Hm, fair point. Recently it seems “worth time” would be indie films or genres that are pushing style as well as impressive plots/ storytelling. When I look at Shazam I see a lighthearted Superman film, lots of self aware/ modern jokes (which I can look past, but don’t prefer)"
"4976","Booked tickets for @ShazamMovie tomorrow! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>
@IntoLautner going too of course."
"4977","@ZacharyLevi I don’t know if you’ll see this post, but man that was a fantastic movie! Your performance was spot on and the message of the movie was just laid out beautifully. Seriously congrats man! #SHAZAM"
"4978","Shazam is one of the only good DC movies that Warner Brothers has made."
"4979","Kind of disappointed because everyone said « SLOW HANDS IS IN SHAZAM », but we can barely hear it. I wanted to sing it loudly in the theater <U+2639><U+FE0F>"
"4980","We saw TWO trailers for Endgame before Shazam and.. I was on the verge of crying. So not ready for the whole movie."
"4981","@SweetKCCabello  cof cof"
"4982","@AngryJoeShow My list: Shazam, aquaman, Wonder Woman (note I liked Wonder Woman and aquaman same amount, but the final act and the villain in WW), man of steel, bvs, justice league, suicide squad"
"4983","@elterrazas24 Prob Bc spiderverse main character wasn’t white and Shazam’s two mains were but tbh the majority of the actors WERE diverse in Shazam so I would still call it pretty diverse as far as superhero movies go"
"4984","i watched shazam and i just  want to make it clear that i would die for all of the characters"
"4985","@PhilHinton @ODEONCinemas I second the quality of Sound Mix, i think you can finally put Peter Pan to rest when Shazam's disc be out"
"4986","Completely agree with you!"
"4987","Guess I will watch Shazam tomorrow <U+0001F914>"
"4988","@Seven_Soldiers @ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie @DCComics @JenniferDeRoss @JeffCapo @AceComics @buse_chris @DallanB @BiLLYd_licious @reggiereggie @ClassicJLA I think I used to have every single one of those!!!!"
"4989","On my way to watch #Shazam
Been wanting this movie since I was a kid"
"4990","@supitscarrie @ThoseNerds @snyder_cut @blackreignfire Just watched Shazam! again. It's bright, colourful, and fun. I loved it, the kids in the crowd loved it, even my mom loved it.

It's a better Superman movie than anything Snyder has even thought about."
"4991","@Luiz_Fernando_J @iamadityajha1 You're the most optimistic person i've seen about Shazam so i really hope you're right.

I'm on the box office sub on Reddit and almost everyone there thinks it'll make around $350M- $420M"
"4992","I'm agree with that"
"4993","@WLimestall @WordNerd421 Jealous. I've got essays to grade, but first I'm seeing #Shazam! Again."

And is that the kid from IT? <U+0001F605>"
"5001","@DavidKHarbour Saw the preview today when we saw Shazam. It’s so happening that we’re going to see Hellboy. Get in XxX"
"5002","@JerryOrdway @ShazamMovie The comics i totally approve. But the movie was a fail to me."
"5003","@DCComics @JerryOrdway @ShazamMovie Sorry but the movie was terrible. I didn't know the wizard searched out champions at random. Hes kinda like biz analyst that sends out surveys to anyone with enough criteria.Also,The mechanics of how the 7 ddly sins are connected to their host is very problematic to me."
"5004","@SEN1227 @dc_jp @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @geoffjohns @1moreGaryFrank Hated it. Poor depiction of the wizard. Chooses champions at random??! Awful. That spherical entrapmemt for the 7 ddly sins was a lousy disservice to the comics too. All you have to do is kill the host, rip out his eye and all the ghosts get sucked into shere So much Unreason."
"5005","I went back later and got to actually talk to him without turning into a wreck, and he drew a Captain Marvel/Shazam for me. It all turned out great, but it's still my favorite story of my brain completely shutting down. Meeting Joe Kubert went much smoother, thank god."
"5006","Just finished #Shazam and I’ll give 7.5 solid film"
"5007","Just got back from seeing Shazam! Definitely the best DC movie in recent years. There's a great sense of confidence throughout the film. Zachery Levi does a wonderful job bringing energy (no pun intended) and all in all, yeah - not bad!"
"5008","The Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat references in Shazam were really inept."
"5009","#Shazam was even better the second time around!! It’s absolutely my new favourite not really a Christmas movie, Christmas movie. Sorry, Bruce Willis."
"5010","the adult cast of shazam...there’s really LEVELS to this shit"
"5011","Hope everyone is having a great day! Off to gym then just chill home. Then Shazam."
"5012","@XanderMobusVO Shazam is absolutely worth it"
"5013","@yungk0b3 Haha. I always have and still love #Shazam it speaks to my inner child. <U+0001F60E>"
"5014","I'm seeing Shazam! I am very excited for this movie."
"5015","yall please go and watch shazam!!!!!"
"5016","@RedDead2Arthurr Shazam would be respected more if it didn't have a superman cameo. It's miles better than Aquaman. God, that movie was garbage"
"5017","@ChazzSavage What kind of films do you like or consider ""worth your time?"" I've seen #Shazam twice now, It's fun, has a good script and is generally pretty comfy.  It's also competently made too."
"5018","I've been watched Zachary Levy since CHUCK (one of my favorite series), so I know exactly how comedic SHAZAM! is gonna be."
"5019","The main reason I watch Shazam is because Zachary Levy (also it's a superhero movie), but I think the kid version in the movie is way more cooler. The actor who plays Freddie kinda reminds me of @RealChalamet (no wonder he plays the younger version of him in Beautiful Boy then)"
"5020","@DoctorJoeCool Honestly I wasn't expecting for the movie to introduce the Shazam family; it was a very cool moment but I would have save that for the sequel. But overall it was awesome!"
"5021","Shazam gave us a positive representation of a diverse family and instead of celebrating that y'all would rather twist it into more marvel vs dc bullshit"

"5032","Saw ye old Shazam last night.

A simple story with compelling characters and is funny AF.

A DCent movie."
"5033","anyway shazam was really good it was definitely more comedy based than the other dceu movies but it was refreshing I enjoyed it"
"5034","Was supposed to see shazam today and was loiking forward to it but last second its not gonna happen :/"
"5035","Had a lot of fun talking about the very fun #Shazam with @NextBestPicture and @tweedledeedee33 this morning!"
"5036","I've still seen nothing but endless praise for Shazam and it makes me even more excited to see it tonight, pretty certain I'll end up absolutely loving it"
"5037","Everybody watch #SHAZAM and #HellboyMovie"
"5038","@arris_quinones I really enjoyed Shazam! I think it covered a lot of Captain Marvel lore. Having said that, Captain Marvel and Billy’s performances didn’t sink up and I don’t understand Billy’s motivation to suddenly care about his family."
"5039","Hey @marvel , @neilhimself makes a good point about hoping the story gets a proper finish. Any chance it could happen in the same year where 2 characters connected to the history of #CaptainMavel  both have #BigScreen films currently in theatres? #Shazam #MarvelMan #MiracleMan"
"5040","Shazam was really good and the post credits scene has me ready for a sequel."
"5041","@ChainsawReacts Can you guys talk about Shazam if you guys have already seen it"
"5042","@johnsemley3000 Nah we're gonna need you to go see Shazam a couple more times."
"5043","If you have not seen #Shazam yet, then you need to do yourself a favour and go see it. It was an absolute joy to watch and I'm almost definitely going to go and see it again at least once."
"5044","@ZacharyLevi If you do read just wanted to say that I absolutely loved your newest movie <U+26A1><U+FE0F>SHAZAM!<U+26A1><U+FE0F> I really liked the scene where the whole family transformed it was so cool! Great movie highly recommend <U+0001F44D>"
"5045","I'd give Shazam an 8/10 highly recommend you see this it's a great family movie that i think anyone can enjoy unless you hate everything DC does and even then shazam has marvel style humor in it so stop hating <U+0001F602>"
"5046","#Shazam Is directed by David Sandberg and is staring Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, and Jack Dylan Grazer. I loved this movie alot it's so much fun, the comedy works 90% of the time. It's alot more touching then expected. The chemistry shared between the 3 leads feels really genuine"
"5047","Taking Dash to see Shazam we gotta see every superhero movie that comes out <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"5048","Just saw this.  Very fun!  Kids loved it!"
"5049","A boy superhero trapped in the body of a grown up man,unsure about his potential,is a hell of fun.Shazam! is superb,well done DC!"
"5050","Abnormally excited for Shazam. I have no attachment to the character but those trailers looked dope. Seeing it later today :)"
"5051","@ShazamMovie  is pretty damned good. 

Stay for the after credits bit. Really funny animation"
"5052","Yeah...I liked Shazam. <U+26A1><U+0001F619> <U+26A1>

Glad I got to see it with my Shazam Fam."
"5053","@ryno1185 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Thanks, good to know. I think Greg’s wanting to see it <U+263A><U+FE0F> so we might see it after we come back from Florida"
"5054","Just got done watching Shazam, and it gets two big thumbs up.  It knows what it is and doesn’t try to be what it isn’t.  I would encourage anyone to see it."
"5055","Shazam was cool. Most of the action was wack to me though"
"5056","@_joshpray I'm going to see Shazam tomorrow. I hope u right bro"
"5057","Since watching the movie, my 6 Year old nephew keep shouting #Shazam. If lightning hits him and transforms him into a 30 Year Old, You're to blame @ponysmasher"
"5058","@PrimeVideo I went to the theatre for #SHAZAM and am binge watching season 2 of #TheTick. Both are fantastic!"
"5059","#Shazam ""Billy Beatson, I chose you!!"""
"5060","@ZacharyLevi You were so awewome, Zach. You gave new life to Shazam. Been a fan of yours since ""Kip"" in ""Less Than Perfect"". Salute! #HolyMoly #NerdHerd"
"5061","That was fun! My review should be coming out sometime soon."
"5062","@Mavinajfan @StephenMerchant I came here to recommend the exact same bed, so unless we're in another Sinbad in Shazam situation it was a real thing that happened"
"5063","Shazam is a fun movie that keeps you relaxed and distracted from the inevitable emotional rollercoaster that Endgame will be."
"5064","Watching Shazam made me want to binge Chuck all over again. I hope this movie makes some good money just for my boy, Zachary. He deserves it."
"5065","But the biggest surprise face in #Shazam: John Glover! Lionel Luthor! His hair is still the most beautiful thing in the world."
"5066","So I watched #Shazam, and boy, Meagan Good is doing a pretty spot-on Jessica-Parker-Kennedy-as-Nora. #TheFlash"
"5067","Shazam was worth the trip to the theater. Plenty of balance between comedy / drama / action. @Firefaerie81"
"5068","Theater is PACKED for #Shazam! This makes happy because this movie looks great."

"5073","Shazam is probably the best DC offering so far. Hilarious movie.<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"5074","Can shazam enter the speedforce <U+0001F636> @revancole @martianbxy ?"
"5075","@Lons One element at play may be that people put too much of a curve on ratings. I suspect many parents think PG means fine for any age; that is NOT what ""Parental guidance suggested"" means. Then PG-13 is for anyone over 5. No one *isn't* letting their 9yo see SHAZAM."
"5076","@Chillguydraws @CKDrawsStuff Shazam is too good for the Justice League"
"5077","There’s something very satisfying about Adam Brody from The OC being a superhero.

I don't do solo movie runs enough.

Fun movie, some really comedic parts from interactions between freddie and shazam, that kid could be a great comedy actor in the future. Would probably watch it again.

"5081","Why was Shazam made into a movie instead of Static Shock?"
"5082","Hi I'm from the world famous Zumbrota MN, as mentioned in Shazam.

Ha ha my random hometown being mentioned in a DC movie definitely caught me off guard"

"5091","Not an official OPP review, but @ShazamMovie is absolutely terrific. Fun from front to back. Really catches the spirit of the character."
"5092","@EricVespe Yeah, that even managed to surprise me! I'm shocked at how far Shazam went in some places"
"5093","@Klokis527 Well, bear in mind that's just my opinion as a self proclaimed Shazam fan, but, seeing as I'm one of 3 people who think SS is one of the most underrated movies in the last decade, it must mean something that I've out Shazam over it"
"5094","@realhartman @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Fortuntely all the criminals, thugs and muggers were white. At least that was realistic, you know, in crime ridden and super black Philadelphia."

"5096","@Terri_Schwartz Yes of course <U+0001F60D> That was Amazing and also that joke when shazam says Say My Name And they say BILLY!  <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"

"5105","@272715021 @Mack46967496 @HailHydra1237 @GiteshPandya Which is what DC is dealing with with Shazam.  It's performing very close to Ant Man right now.  Guardians of the Galaxy had a $30M opening in China.  Shazam looks to be about $35M."
"5106","Off to the movies to see @ZacharyLevi in #Shazam.  I can't remember the last movie I saw in a theater."
"5107","There’s a scary scene in Shazam that  would’ve fit aquaman better if they didn’t scrap the “horror movie underwater” thing"
"5108","@Boogie2988 Was Billy really pure of heart?  He stole he was a jerk and only found family when mommy rejected him.  Freddie was way more pure and should've been Shazam but like I said forget that handicapped freak run him over with a car because it's funny<U+0001F923>"
"5109","@tannerlafond @YahooEnt Thing is, both movies earned their diverse credibility, but the curb appeal of Shazam (white hero, sidekick, AND villain) as opposed to Spider-verse's, comes up short. It shouldn't be a competition, I just feel that is a factor."
"5110","Shazam!’s cape is the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen and ppl still try to pretend like DC is on the same level as Marvel lmao"
"5111","I absolutely adored #ShazamMovie it was pure of heart its message was so sweet I can’t recommend this movie enough"
"5112","@ZacharyLevi shazam was amazing I absolutely loved it and its message of family amazing job"
"5113","Shazam is the shit, best DC movie to date"
"5114","Shazam was good I was not disappointed what so ever. Thanks again @DCComics and @wbpictures for putting out movies that I enjoy! Now Man of Steel 2 PLEASE!"
"5115","I see various comments about the diversity that's in #Shazam, so here's mine - it's bloody fantastic and feels completely natural."
"5116","@TalkingSuperman Have you read Power of Shazam yet?"

Great work to @ZacharyLevi and the kids."

"5132","#Shazam is a movie that hilariously answers what happens if a hero doesn’t get the Uncle Ben talk! My favorite DC movie by far. Not going to lie DC may have found their groove finally."
"5133","I’m probably gonna see Shazam on Tuesday because I’m out of town and the theater closest to me charges 30 dollars for a ticket. I’m not that inclined to see it.

Though I am curious; it’s the first of the DC Movies to garner positive reviews from people I trust"
"5134","Had my heart broken by pet semetary last night. I don’t even know why I get excited about my favorite things anymore.

Shazam was great though. Wasn’t expecting that."
"5135","Don’t get me wrong Shazam was cool ..good movie ..I just wasn’t blown away by it like so many others have been and I’m cool with that"
"5136","It’s interesting how people reacted to Shazam’s lead versus Captain Marvels. Both are white, yet because one is a male it’s suddenly a problem. That’s how you know “woke” white twitter is a huge joke"
"5137","@1JohnLivesay @ShazamMovie @JerryOrdway @ZacharyLevi @LetsTalkCM @DCComics @geoffjohns @sterlinggates @aaronlopresti That caption really fails to describe what's going on, doesn't it?"

"5141","@BlackMajikMan90 @Steele131 @kingteth That's not what the tweet says though. It says it will cross $100M after Sunday closer to Wonder Woman's $125M opening so I'm wondering where it says Shazam! will have a $150M global opening."

"5158","@deepakG47 There are many fight sequences between Dr.Sivana and #Shazam may that was too much and they didn't hesitate to skip through couple of seconds"
"5159","@iFunny Shazam really be out here"
"5160","No it isn’t. Kindly GTFO with that noise, please. You fringe lunatics make the rest of us look really bad with your rhetoric and behavior toward the future of the DCEU. Shazam will be just fine thanks to rational DC fans and the general audience that digs it now."
"5161","Shazam any good prolly go see it in a bit"
"5162","@GoSoundtracks @aquamanmovie @WonderWomanFilm @ShazamMovie @justiceleaguewb @BatmanvSuperman @SuicideSquadWB @DCComics wow.  No love for MOS.  I guess that's par for the course.  Its not a very well loved film.

I feel like the only person who has MOS ranked #1.  (haven't seen Shazam)"
"5163","@GrimgoreTheRed It was, but in general the whole of the DC universe on the big screen has had a real problem with getting away from making everything super grim dark and it's a little exhausting for me. 

I'm hearing great things about Shazam though, so I'm looking forward to checking it out."
"5164","@AnxietyFC Buy weed definitely. And get a buddy to spot your ticket to Shazam. Smoke some weed with the buddy before watching the film and enjoy the lightning <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+0001F601>"
"5165","@CJLLonewolf That’s the jist I’m gathering. 

Just got back from Disney and getting back into the swing. Was going to watch the Original after the remake per Lee’s recommendation. Leaning toward Shazam first. I am a bit of a superhero whore."
"5166","@CJLLonewolf Seeing both this weekend, but which should I go with tonight, Shazam or Sematary?

Never saw the original Sematary."
"5167","Watched #SHAZAM and thought it was great that Freddy Freeman was a #disabled character. Then he was “cured” of his “problem” when he became a superhero. Why? Can’t disabled people be #superheroes too? #shameful @DCComics @ShazamMovie #ShazamMovie"

Fantastic film, the purest form of Saturday morning super hero adventure on the big screen. #shazam"

"5172","Just saw #Shazam 
Was entertained and actually excited the entire movie Loved the dark and edgy tone mixed with the comedy. If more DC movies were like this you'd have a DCMU. Zachary Levi was fantastic. Please we need the sequel."
"5173","Believe me, if shazam(s) join justice league, other members beside superman are sidekicks.

9/10 - astonishing film!"

"5184","Seated for “Shazam”, whatever that is. Some nerd shit probably"
"5185","Shazam was awesome, I hope DC's movies continue to be as optimistic and hopeful (and no I'm not watching the joker movie)"
"5186","Shazam was great though weirdly dark in places for such lighthearted movie. Ending made me really want a sequel. A one liner hinted one of the characters may be gay which is the state of queer representation in superhero movies in 2019. Will see if sequel does something with it"
"5187","Not even a contest, my man. @captainmarvel was simply a bad movie.

@ShazamMovie was a lot of fun. Highly recommended."

"5195","@snyder_cut @Trevor56510778 @theramblerouser @ThoseNerds @blackreignfire Shazam isn't flopping tho"
"5196","Anyway #Shazam offers a different type of humor than the typical Marvel movie. Instead of a high density of jokes, #Shazam puts value on situation comedy which is a huge advantage for the film."
"5197","Seeing the new Shazam movie"
"5198","Took my sister and nephew to see #Shazam. It was amazing. @ZacharyLevi was made for this role. There was some parts where my nephew was scared but other all he loved it."
"5199","@TheFliteCast ""Trying to marvelize your movies was a mistake""

Someone hasn't seen Aquaman or Shazam. Especially the latter."
"5200","why yes i have already mentally drafted my letterboxd review for Shazam involving an obvious joke about the music identifying app before even seeing it. no, i'm not taking creative input at this time."
"5201","This nice fellow I know named @ZacharyLevi has a new movie called Shazam and you can see it this weekend if you want! I’m going to and I’m going to have a great time doing it. May I humbly recommend you do the same!?"
"5202","In the cinema for shazam and wow.. Nearly every trailer shows London being destroyed. XD"
"5203","@ShazamMovie I went to watch it 2 days ago. It was AWESOME!!!! You all did a great job."
"5204","but all three movies had their flaws (solely representation-wise) — shazam casting an able-bodied actor as a disabled character, spiderverse’s racist peni parker character, black panther propping up monarchy"
"5205","shazam had really wonderful characters of color in it, yes! however, calling it more “diverse” than spiderverse or black panther ... <U+0001F914>"
"5206","not to be that guy but this really ain’t it"
"5207","@Nikres We’re heading to Shazam later"

"5209","Justice League who? #Shazam"
"5210","saw #shazam yesterday and it's a decent film with a lot of fun parts. I think I would've liked it more if it took place in the late 80s or 90s, but otherwise it was solid. good villian + good hero."
"5211","and i also went to see shazam. amazing. powerful. wonderful. strong. empowering... yeah..."
"5212","Im seeing shazam after work so like ill be at the movies from 9 am to 10pm i love my job<U+0001F61C>"

"5222","#Shazam proves that even #DC is capable of tickling the audience's funny bones
The movie was a fun ride yet I felt that the 2nd half had lengthy fight sequences
Anyway.. The movie did justice to the money paid for the ticket @newlinecinema @DCComics @warnerbrosindia @ShazamMovie"

"5225","it‘s quite sad that some people said that shazam super sucked, maybe they only watch superhero movies for action fights 24/7? ergh it’s way beyond than that fyi ;)"

"5227","#Shazam was a great fucking time! The movie was super enjoyable and come on, @RossButler in a super suit <U+0001F60D> I’ll be needing more of that!

"5230","Yo #SHAZAM is no joke!  It’s tremendous, fun, funny, scary, awesome action, great cast, great story.  @DCComics is knockin’em outta the park now.  But I wanna see Shazam face off against @TheRock ‘a #BlackAdam, fingers crossed that’s still coming!"
"5231","Boy DC has really upped their game.. aquaman was incredible and Shazam! Was REALLY good."
"5232","@ShazamMovie was so fucking cool. Best part was watching it in a theater full of 12 year olds cheering on their role model."
"5233","@JesabelRaay @BlackMajikMan90 @Steele131 @kingteth OP is only referring to the overseas $$$ so if you factor in the money it's making domestically too then I can definitely see #Shazam hitting close to that 150 mark (or even higher, who knows?)"
"5234","Shazam is going to be lit"
"5235","Q The Winged Serpent, scared the living shit out of me."
"5236","Shazam is better than Aquaman  in my honest opinion"

"5238","#Shazam was excellent. Funny and intense at the exact same time. Deep mythology in the backstory, can’t wait for more! GO DC!"

"5246","someone come see shazam with me"
"5247","I just want to say.... You all better not let Shazam be the dceu lowest grossing movie. It deserves love.

Let JL in that place for a long time until the suicide squad 'sequel' comes out and get that title"
"5248","@TheComixKid @SuperheroSciFi Shazam probably will perform really well despite Endgame coming out at the end of this month. It won't do a billion but highest I say around 500mill low end 450. That's huge considering its budget and again Endgame. But kids will still see it and they will need their parents too"

"5255","#Shazam is a terrific movie - funny, entertaining, and a high view of family. 

Go see it, it's worth the couple of hours, and stay for the 2 after credit scenes."

"5261","Shazam!

That was extremely entertaining and heartwarming as fuck and everyone should go watch it right now

8.6/10"
"5262","Seriously go watch Aquaman and Shazam. They are really great movies."
"5263","...my sister pointed out that Shazam felt a lot like Jingle All The Way and she's totally right"
"5264","Really enjoyed Shazam. DC finally figured out how to make good super hero movies. Just like Aquaman, this one also was really fun and knew exactly when to make things serious and bring tension while keeping it's charm. It felt so fresh compared to recent Marvel films too."
"5265","Really enjoyed #Shazam! Super fun and highly enjoyable comic book film. Hats off to @ZacharyLevi for an excellent performance!"
"5266","Shazam.... pretty much what you’d expect from DC <U+0001F602>"
"5267","@ShazamMovie I just watched it, it’s so amazing"
"5268","I was thinking of making a YouTube video to review Shazam but I might as well just rank the whole DCEU!"
"5269","I wouldn’t say Shazam didn’t have forced humour. There were lots of instances where it was a little too cheesy."
"5270","Finish watching......it much better than ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Justice League"" movie ...@DCComics and @WBHomeEnt  are learning from their mistakes #morehumor loving it #Shazam"
"5271","@ZacharyLevi My dad for a long time never really understood or respected my love for DC. I took him to see Shazam last night and he saw my reactions at various points. Mother told me this morning that he finally saw how much these characters mean to me. So thank you for that <U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"5272","@Goldyn_charitis Finish watching......it much better than ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Justice League"" movie ...@DCComics and @WBHomeEnt  are learning from their mistakes #morehumor loving it #Shazam"
"5273","#SHAZAM was really good! So funny and heartwarming, this is probably my favorite DC movie since... The Dark Knight? I'm serious!"
"5274","One of my favorites things about @ShazamMovie is the diversity of the cast. Doesn't get enough credit for it"
"5275","@TheDaveCave_ Skip both and watch the original Pet Sematary. Lol

I enjoyed Shazam way more than the new Pet Sematary but if you've never seen the original you likely wont have many issues with the remake."
"5276","Instead of Billy Batson it should be Billy BadAss <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> #ShazamMovie"
"5277","How do you pronounce Shazam #AskingForAFriend"
"5278","And it's surprising how little I've heard about its diversity because it's... y'know... a good film."
"5279","Same with Spider-Verse really.

I heard more about Brie Larson having a vaganiyah and being a hero than I did about that or Shazam."
"5280","I wanted to watch #Shazam today but I’m not done packing"
"5281","Shazam is definitely up there in the top 3 DC Movies next to Wonder Woman and Aquaman. It was hilarious throughout, the story was about a decent 8 out of 10, and the action was alright for standard DC film."
"5282","now that a lot of y’all have seen shazam, can we appreciate this underrated tweet of mine"
"5283","Shazam was so good! Such a fun and cute movie, and so much of the good stuff they didn't give away in the trailers!"
"5284","Shazam was actually a great movie, not usually a fan of the D.C. Movies but @ZacharyLevi kills it dude, been following the guy since Chuck."
"5285","Time for #Shazam!
Expect a review..."
"5286","Shazam is the Justice League movie we deserved"
"5287","Then there’s other DC villains roaming around Fawcett City like Arson Fiend, Blaze, Captain Nazi, Doctor Smashi. Basically there are female villains out of Shazam’s Rogues as well like Aunt Minerva and Chain Lightening."
"5288","@ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie Yes, Clark had Lois, Jimmy, Perry, Lana and the like... but it was awhile before Krypto and the Legion showed up. So Cap had super-powered circle of friends, family and allies before Superman did.  And Batman did too... or at least costumed crime fighter circle before Clark."
"5289","@ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie I always wondered why Captain Marvel... even Batman I believe had female counterparts before Supergirl arrived on the scene for Superman.  (Didn't Kathy and Bette show up before Kara?).  Cap w/Mary, Jr and the Lts... even Hoppy certainly developed a SUPER family before Clark."
"5290","@ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie One Olympian acknowledging the other."
"5291","@ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie I did not know that.  This is why you along with Jennifer, Martin, Jeff, Keith, Maya, Carol, Steve, Kara-Q and LTJSA for being in the pantheon of comic book historian gods and goddesses."
"5292","I want to see SHAZAM again"
"5293","#Shazam is the best comic book movie since #SupermanTheMovie, in my humble opinion."
"5294","@BrunoMars I love to hear your music @BrunoMars with a twist. I even enjoyed it more in the new movie Shazam! Great family comic movie and nice reminder that I am full blooded Hooligan <U+0001F61C><U+0001F44A><U+0001F3FD><U+2665><U+FE0F><U+0001F3B6>"

"5296","@CitadelIMAX16 @Fandango
Is there a reason there is no signage up for SHAZAM! in your theater? I went for the early pass viewing on the 23rd &amp; again last night for the IMAX show and there was nothing in the lobby or even a framed poster outside."
"5297","Calling it here: Shazam 2 includes a post-credit scene that leads into Black Adam, then Black Adam has a post-credit scene that leads into Shazam 3, the big Shazam vs. Black Adam movie."
"5298","Shazam is actually a film wtf, thought them posters was advertisement for the app"
"5299","@RealJohnGlover dude, if you're just going to father supervillains, maybe consider not having any more kids... #Shazam"

"5306","So I'm going to watch shazam... I am actually really excited for this one"
"5307","You guys! Shazam! is such a good movie!!!

Loved the story, loved the acting, had tons of fun!

At least an 8/10. I recommend."
"5308","Didn't expect that level of viciousness from Sivana in #Shazam but it worked well. Good counter tone to the comedy and mandatory cheese the movie had. Really fun movie."
"5309","@DT2ComicsChat @PeteSpideyTalk pretty much the same for me, I'll see it eventually but new 52 Shazam is not as intresting to me at least, always about personal tastes and to each their own, but the only DCEU character that really feels like the decades old comic version of the character to me is Wonder Woman"
"5310","Really enjoyed #SHAZAM “just say the word”"
"5311","@Skipperwing I think everyone who’s not you could see this movie and think, “I should check out some shazam comics!”

That was me after Man of Steel. I know I’m still more in the know, but it’s not a big stretch."
"5312","Just seen #ShazamMovie ... really brill and darker than I thought.  The foster parents were lovely - ‘Jerry’ (Cooper Andrews) from the Walking Dead was ace ... somewhat better than mine... must have had support from a rights based social worker from @BradfordCollege!"
"5313","Shazam is currently sitting at $67 million. This is from Thursday and Friday, foreign and domestic."

#NoSpilers but, there is 1 cut scene in the credits. So don't leave before the credits roll.

"5338","This so sad. I hope they find the culprits.<U+0001F92D><U+0001F92D>"
"5339","I’m just very glad DC said “fuck a Marvel formula” and prioritized making movies for the fun of it. That’s why Aquaman banged. That’s why Shazam banged. Making art out of love and passion &gt;&gt;&gt; making art solely to compete."
"5340","Hey, the Majestic Theater in Greenville, Tx says they are playing @UnplannedMovie on their website at 1:40, and we drove for an hour to come see it. We get here and are told that that theater is now playing Shazam instead. Site still says Unplanned. Very frustrating!"
"5341","Perfect #ShazamMovie review. “This movie saved so many things that weren’t in the trailer!” <U+0001F499><U+0001F525><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"5342","#Shazam is really good. And it had surprises that I didn't expect. It is so rare for that to happen in a comic book film. I don't want to over-hype it, but it was so delightful. I might go see it again."
"5343","So is #MarkStrong your brother @michaelrosenbum and @RealJohnGlover? #SHAZAM #Shazammovie"
"5344","okay i know no one on this campus bout to go watch shazam with me..... L"
"5345","#SHAZAM<U+2060> <U+2060>was pretty good. @ZacharyLevi sold the kid hero vibe perfectly. Villain was a bit bland if perfectly acted by Mark Strong. Wish they incorporated the 7 deadly sins a bit more thematically.
I rate it: <U+2728>a fraction of stars<U+2728>"
"5346","Devin keeps shouting “SHAZAM!” every time he walks into the kitchen as the lights come on with the sensor. 

Help me please"
"5347","Okay I’m reading Shazam stuff and... we’re reading a guy saying “not my thing” in a female strip club as gay? Cool cool cool. ((Sighs in asexual))

(To be fair, that probably IS what it means. I’m just tired.)"
"5348","Really enjoyed @ShazamMovie and @DCComics is moving in a better direction with their movies. It has a great cast, a good story and funny moments. Little weird that it was released around Eastern. It would have been a great Christmas movie. Nonetheless, go see it!"
"5349","@ZacharyLevi My friend and I saw it at the @Fandango Advance Screening, The Hollywood Premiere, The Wondercon Screening (I missed out on that one) but you know I’ll see this film over &amp; over again.  That’s how great this film is <U+0001F60A><U+0001F39E><U+26A1><U+FE0F>

"5353","Shazam was alright. Did I enjoy watching it? Yes. Would I watch it again? Maybe in a few years when its out on TV and theres nothing else to watch."
"5354","If you’re in a shit mood, Shazam! will get you out of it for at least the two hours you’re watching it. What a goddamn delight that movie was."
"5355","Going to go see @ShazamMovie at @AMCTheatres Dublin, Ohio at 8:30 P.M. then it is off to Stephen's in Marysville, Ohio for some dancing.  No drinks...I've been #sober for 30 days now."
"5356","Just went and saw Shazam with my grandson we both loved it way 5o go DC! #shazam #DCEU"
"5357","Shazam was a fun movie that, no joke, you should not bring your little kids to. There are some genuinely terrifying moments in the film that I'm pretty sure will cause nightmares."

"5361","Solo movie theater vibes #Shazam"
"5362","Shazam wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Was kind of bored by the villain parts, and the horroristic elements were completely unnecessary and uncalled for. But the kid turning into superhero part was fun and it had a great dramatic climax."
"5363","@SoNortori_us @_joshpray Dc only released 3 good films and Shazam ain’t one of em so you need to relax marvel ain’t got shit to worry about"
"5364","Saw #ShazamMovie and loved it. So much joy and fun in a superhero movie.  No brooding, no pretension. Just pure all out fun. See it."
"5365","Shazam looks like a real fun movie and I'll probably go see it next week, I'm glad DC is doing fun movies as well but the next person that tells me ""DC are finally taking a page from Marvel's book and doing superhero movies their way"" can go jump up their own ass and die."
"5366","Not only is #Shazam the best. It’s unique and full of heart and fun. Also somehow it’s both the best Superman and Flash movie as well!  Congrats @ZacharyLevi !!"

"5376","Best way to describe #Shazam is a slice of warm apple pie.  Best way to describe the avengers is someone shoving a funnel down your throat and pouring corn syrup and sugar all all the candy at once down your mouth until you throw up #Endgame @DCComics @MarvelStudios"
"5377","@TheRightDefense @BurnettRM @ROBSERVATIONS2 @TBurnettwork Same here. Anything I don't want to get spoiled is a day one watch. Can't go til Sunday this weekend, taking my nephew and 2 of his cousins...I should get a voucher for a free Blu Ray or Digital download of Shazam after buying these tickets and hitting the concession stand haha"
"5378","I just watched #Shazam, I went in with no excitement (apologies for that) and came out having absolutely enjoyed it! 
This again shows DC can have some fantastic films, stepping away from a forced cinematic universe is the right choice. 
I highly recommend seeing it!"
"5379","Update : if you like children's movies you'll enjoy it. The humor is predictable and wack. 3/10."
"5380","Guys if you have the time, go watch Shazam. It’s a fun movie to watch. 10/10 lightning bolts. Okay that is all. Have a good weekend. #ShazamMovie"

"5382","@ZacharyLevi I just watched #SHAZAM and it brought me so much joy-<U+2764>-so very much joy. Appreciation to all involved and many heartfelt thank you's."
"5383","And to be extra fair, the only reason I know who Shazam is, is because of DC deckbuilder

Thought it was a good meme either way"
"5384","Very happy to see that @wbpictures has scored another hit movie that isn't daaaarrrrk and glooooomy with @ShazamMovie"
"5385","I’m going to see fucking Shazam! tonight with my friend Max. Bruh."

A bolt of lightning strikes the boy, and he is transformed into the large more powerful being of himself.

"5393","@ShazamMovie really comical never a dull moment!"
"5394","Not remotely interested in seeing Shazam unless it’s on someone else’s dime. Yes I’m cheap but I profoundly dislike the character, and the casting makes it 10 times worse for me. They literally couldn’t have casted someone worse."
"5395","(Shazam spoiler) the Shazam fam shouting BILLY when he asked them to say his name was literally peak comedy. I love this movie. #shazam"

"5397","@ZacharyLevi #SHAZAM IS EVERYTHING!!!!! What is everything? 
#family &amp; #love"
"5398","@belongscabello there's this scene where shazam teleports them (the kids) to a strip club and he says “it’s not really for me” or something like that which is either just pedro not being a meatheaded hetero and trying to be more mature but also could be a sign the character will be gay"
"5399","First #Aquaman and now #Shazam, two hits in a row for DC. Wow. Can we go for three with #Joker?"
"5400","I really hope I find time to see #Shazam again, but I don't know if I will due to studying for exams."
"5401","I'll go ahead and say I totally underestimated #Shazam, such a good movie"
"5402","You guys should totally watch Shazam!

THAT was a real good superhero movie (with pacing issues)!

Finally a DC movie worth watching (besides Wonderwoman)"
"5403","I want to Shazam so badly but this review but it to NEED TO GO TOMORROW"
"5404","Shazam ended up getting the lowest opening for a DCEU (Worlds of DC) franchise? At least it was able to get a 5 in front of it. #ShazamMovie #Shazam"
"5405","Lol. Does this woman not understand the meaning of diversity? Trying to go after Shazam cos it actually is a very diverse comic book film, something which the MCU has yet to deliver."

"5412","#Shazam worst ever DC movie <U+0001F64F> @TheDCUniverse pathetic work after a film like #Aquaman"
"5413","A superhero movie is not great because of its special effects, but because of its history, its characters and the emotions it conveys to us.
#Shazam will not have the spectacular effects of Aquaman but in emotions it is a pure heart."
"5414","Shazam! captivated me from the villain originally chosen to be the champion start through Billy’s foster home to the end where he fully becomes the hero there is some surprising dark moments featuring the seven deadly sins and some amazing jaw dropping effects lots of fun too"
"5415","Shazam! a delightful fun emotional romp from start to finish this is like a child’s dream come to life that even adults still have here both alike can live out a superhero fantasy in this a breezy fun awesome joyful watch this is why this genre can shine wow loved it 
10/10"
"5416","Shazam! not really knowing this hero I am excited for the future to see more adventures get to know more about this magical side of the DC universe as this was a pure fun romp perfect for the big screen with some great performances from the young and old cast and a evil villain"
"5417","watching the new episode of Doom Patrol again because it rules, and it’s hard to believe that it and Shazam aren’t actually in the same universe"
"5418","shazam is pretty great, and I do enjoy the in-universe pot shots, as something that was supposed to right the boat after the snyderverse collapsed under the weight of its own words, and it did that"

"5420","@qwellcrist If there's one thing that will have to be taken from my cold, dead hands, it's a trying and struggling Superman. This offsets Billy/Shazam perfectly and I'm glad u said it <U+0001F62D>"
"5421","@doppelgangbangr @DCComics @ShazamMovie Magic. Billy can share his powers with his family. The whole ‘you choose your family’ thing"

"5424","Definitive ""Shazam!"" review incoming, with a shout-out to @SonnyBunch's central insight into the virtues of the Snyder-led DC universe."
"5425","Between Unbreakable and Shazam, Philadelphia seems to have a good track record of superheroes"
"5426","I really enjoyed the Curse of Shazam miniseries this movie was adapted from, and thought it would be a mostly one-to-one transition, but a lot of scenes actually were changed, without changing the basic elements of the story. 

It works really well!"
"5427","Anyways the best review I can give for the movie itself, is that there were a LOT of kids who walked out of the theater yelling “SHAZAM!!” afterwards"
"5428","There’s not a lot I can say without specific spoilers, so uh basically

#Shazam is Magiranger meets The Goonies and also winds up being a REALLY GOOD Christmas movie in the middle of April. Recommended for a fun time."
"5429","So I just saw someone spoil Shazam with a picture of the last scene, then tag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut..."
"5430","After some #Shazam reaction from you guys I feel reassured in my decision to pass on that movie.
And I feel if you are a supporter of #releasethesnydercut and still undecided you should do so too.
I can't imaging how this movie doing well would be anything but a setback for us."

"5438","@jackpwool @JustSplarrow_ Honestly right now I feel like The dark Knight Shazam and the Winter soldier are like all on the same level of greatness."
"5439","Well that was a shitshow.  Not gonna comment on the refs and instead gonna change the topic.

I'm going to see Shazam! tonight, anyone have any reviews on it? Good movie?"
"5440","So my siblings wanna see Shazam now so I’m seeing it again in an hour.

I was probably gonna see it again anyway so I’m not complaining"
"5441","Just seen #ShazamMovie absolutely loved it start to finish so much fun"
"5442","Obviously End Game will be better than Shazam but all in all, I'd recommend you watch Shazam."

So far this year DC 1-0 Marvel #Shazam"

"5451","how tf are people hating on Shazam for being too light hearted it's like the Scott pilgrim vs the world of comicbook movies dude no one hates on scott pilgrim"
"5452","I hate the fact that Shazam is coming out right before Endgame. I only have the money for one of them, and we all know that I gotta choose Endgame, and I feel like it’s the same for a lot of people, but Shazam doesn’t deserve that as far as I can tell."
"5453","‘Shazam’ is a delight. Sad that piss baby DC fans may have to admit there was no anti-DC bias among critics... Zack Snyder just sucks at making movies."

"5459","Critically it’s done really well (better than Marvel’s recent) and with audiences too. Shazam will do well and with a small budget it’ll still be a BO success. Not everything has to make 100s and a billion. So stuck up these days. I blame Disney for being obsessed with money."
"5460","If I see one most post saying “Shazam” isn’t doing well at the box office when it’s been out for one day I’m gonna stick the seven deadly sins on that person."

"5465","Loved Shazam dont miss out on seeing it."
"5466","Shazam is a much more competent film than the rest of the DC movies so far - yes including Wonder Woman. That said, the only one that works for me emotionally so far has been WW, and there’s still tons of room for improvement to these movies."
"5467","@akasan @ShazamMovie Yeah I went to the early screening two weeks ago, loved it and didn’t bother to go back for opening weekend, cuz it’s April now, the whole vibe is depression. with Game of Thrones and Endgame, no time for this wholesome shit."

"5470","the article says “young orphan Billy Batson lives with a blended family of foster kids who hail from a richly diverse background”, which is true, there’s no reason to be mad about this"
"5471","Have you ever tried to find a song by trying to @Shazam yourself singing it? Has that ever worked?"
"5472","I actually liked Shazam! The villain was pretty mediocre and the some of the CG on the villain characters could have been done better I thought, but i enjoyed most everything else."
"5473","@Terri_Schwartz With Logan/Shane, Shazam/Big and Joker/King of Comedy, are we entering an era of comic book movies taking as much or more from classic films as their source material?"
"5474","@Partizan_Niksic @wbpictures I liked Shazam! more than Aquaman. But this scene is an insult to Supes"
"5475","Shazam? More like...that was so much freaking fun. s/o to DC for this 180 post the terrible Justice League movie. Every single character in this film was enjoyable in their own right and I loved every second of it. Bring me more of these!"

Wonder Woman
Shazam!

"5479","@the_snarkmaster You keep saying Shazam is bombing, but I don't think you know what that means.  It's on track to do extremely well.  A $51m weekend is not bombing by any reasonable metric."
"5480","@the_snarkmaster The movie doesn't need to do $1b of business to be a success.  It's going to do Ant-Man numbers.  That movie had a $130m production budget and grossed $519m.

Shazam is going to do between $450m-$500m."

"5485","@sarahwhit10 Shazam will not do it, because WB didn't support it in anything. They just want that Shazam makes 500 millions and that's all"
"5486","Okay I’m convinced."
"5487","Just saw #Shazam ! And oh my God was it fun!

It was also pretty dark as well. I had fun with this movie.

And you know what the best part was? There was no annoying person or loud child in the theater while we watch the film!

She smiled soon closing the comic and glancing at him.

""The X-Men. Will we play videogame soon or you'll keep training to your next date as 'Shazam'?""

She chuckles."
"5505","""Do you ever think about someone discovering your real identity, Batson?""

She was reading a comic book."
"5506","Shazam is really good. Both Captain Marvels were a lot of fun. #Shazam"
"5507","I think that Mark Strong is a hell of a super villain (in literally any movie) @ShazamMovie"
"5508","#Shazam is by far the best DC movie in recent times."
"5509","Go watch #SHAZAM  and watch the WHOLE thing ;)"
"5510","Shazam was pretty good! The ending part was honestly the best part of it lol"
"5511","@_stormqueen especially when Shazam is also known by Captain Marvel"
"5512","I just want to say I’m very proud of @TheDCUniverse @DCComics @DoomPatrolDCU @ShazamMovie @wbpictures @ponysmasher 

The shazam movie was great and gave the audience a very diverse cast. I can’t say much else without spoiling so I’ll leave it at that<U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F> <U+0001F64A>"
"5513","#Shazam is a 10<U+0001F31F> movie. Man I love the development of the characters and how @DCComics stayed to the true origin of Shazam!
The best quote of the movie:
“Say my name, Billy”. 
There are two major surprises in this movie.   Personally this movie is one of my favorites!"
"5514","Enjoyed seeing #CaptainMarvel and #Shazam 
Next few tweets will be about these movies."
"5515","My reviews of #CaptainMarvel and #Shazam is coming from a person that grew up reading the original stories oof these heroes in the 1980s. 
So as a comic book fan, fanatic, &amp; historian you may not agree with me!"
"5516","@Fej__O Id probably see shazam next weekend then"
"5517","The only con I found was they stumbling a little bit with the villain at the end and less action scenes and they weren't choreographed that well. Overall Shazam is a definite and not to miss out one <U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C>"
"5518","The director did well by not dragging the story in way too emotional stuff. Bits and pieces of emotions alongwith catchy humour makes Shazam a must must watch for every superhero fan. It also had the shades of the Dark tone of the DC, which we all are aware of."
"5519","@StephGallardo Yes, exactly that was a good scene. He collected 73 Dollars saving that woman and a couple got their photo clicked for free hahahaha. I think in Shazam 2, they would possibly reveal the actual money earned <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>The brilliant part of how well they portrayed the thinking of 14 year"
"5520","To all those people who sweared to leave the DCEU after Justice League, buckle up back to the DCEU, like Aquaman collected the shattered bits and pieces of DCEU standardising it, Shazam definitely raised the bar."
"5521","And special mention to @ZacharyLevi portrayal of the Champion ( Shazam ) .He portrayed the character of 14 year old guy dealing with hardships of life and suddenly gets those superpowers. His comic timing was superbly dope."
"5522","The highlight of the movie was the relationship and the bromance shared by Freddy with Billy and Freddy with Shazam. The kids rocked their parts. Shazam also gave many Thor: Ragnarok vibes."
"5523","Watched #Shazam This is probably the best DCEU movie to be released till now. The cinematography, acting was definitely on the point. It's clever, witty, well paced which was really very important and I laughed a lot."
"5524","Saw #Shazam and enjoyed it very, very much. Lots of fun and a heart in just the right place. Perfect pitch of the Big Red Cheese #ShazamMovie
<U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1>

"5526","Just saw Shazam and I couldn't be prouder about the dc family right now. You know what fuck Superman and Batman. Give us flash and green lantern and martian man hunter and cyborg. Them develop Batman and Superman. They have enough hype it's time these guys did."
"5527","Hey folks! I met this girl named Zoey and I am planning to take her on a date to see the movie Shazam in two weeks. I hope her parents approve of it."
"5528","@TheComicConGuy @EternalNavHD @Beth_Robyn_West @ZIRICOCHETIZ Shazam would be a good one."
"5529","Just tried to open Shazam on my phone only for it to turn into an Ipad."
"5530","The way the Seven Deadly Sins was used in Shazam was a little more frightening than how the Trench was used in Aquaman imo. Like I think a kid would be more scared of their scenes. Guess it depends on how much the kid can take tho."
"5531","Did you know the original Captain Marvel was actually Shazam <U+0001F632>"
"5532","@Scientits I was more surprised that Shazam still exists?"
"5533","Totally loved Shazam! I couldn’t say enough good things about the film or @ZacharyLevi &amp; the rest of the cast if I tried."
"5534","Shazam can detect a song that my neighbours are playing on the other end of the street but it can’t scan a song that’s blaring in a room I’m in"
"5535","So I watched Shazam on Thursday and I freaking loved it! It was freaking hilarious. &lt;33 Everything I've ever wanted from the OG Captain Marvel."
"5536","And yes, Shazam! is just as entertaining and sometimes even horrifying a second time. Now with a regular family audience who loved it.

Getting Wan on Aquaman and Sandberg on Shazam was such a good get and has returned us to superhero films similar to Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy."
"5537","That was the shocking part, that surprised me a lot. I didn't expect them to be that deadly and quite scary."
"5538","At the end of Shazam when * showed up half of the theater gasped ...my jaw might have dropped"
"5539","go watch shazam! so asher angel earns enough money to be able to afford breaking his 4-season contract with disney <U+0001F60C><U+2728>"

"5544","Didn't go jogging this morning cause I had a lot to do @ work and had to start early. Finished around 4. Went to the Galleria to watch Shazam. Came back home, and went straight to make tea. Damn, I'm too young to be this old. Social life is zilch"
"5545","@akasan @ShazamMovie Shazam is a really fun movie. You should definitely check it out as soon as you can"
"5546","From what I gather, there was absolutely NO need to include Superman in SHAZAM! movie. It doesn't serve anything. Doesn't make sense. Isn't even that funny. It seems that they did it just out of spite to disrespect previous DCEU Superman movies."

"5560","@kenjisalk Shazam was sooooooo good, I could put it above quite a few MCU films, to be honest!"
"5561","I just saw it today and i have to say this tweet is 100% accurate"
"5562","@ScornComiX @ShazamMovie It has the heart in right place and it is fun. Shazam, WW and Aquaman have been good for DC. :)"
"5563","Something I really appreciated about Shazam is how it makes it clear that the villain is very much a product of toxic masculinity. 

Wouldve liked to see it be explored more but it's a step forward."
"5564","I saw Shazam again n it’s actually more heavy on the themes of toxic masculinity than I initially thought"

@ZacharyLevi 
@ponysmasher 
@gracecfulton 
@JovanArmand 
@jackdgrazer"
"5590","Okay so i saw #Shazam and it was AWESOME!!!
First off all
THE VILLIAN: I loved his motives and the acting wow!
I loved his powers and that he wasn't a Steppenwolf kind of Villian.
I also really liked his costume."
"5591","God please can people in cinemas please shut up?!
I watched Shazam and there where always this group of guys yelling shit out of theyr mouths and people were talking behind my back.
Im okay w people laughing but please shut up"
"5592","What i really like about Billy/Shazam was that i could identify myself with him.
Because i'm in his age and i would act like him when i could get superpowers.(Exept the floss)"
"5593","I saw SHAZAM today and it was awesomely wow <U+0001F62E>"
"5594","@ShazamMovie was DOPE! Best movie experience of the year so far!"
"5595","Me and my friend are playing Mad Libs while waiting to watch Shazam. I told her to write down ""Hope van dyne""
She fucking wrote down ""hope dying"""
"5596","Less brilliant were the couple who brought a 4 year old to Shazam. She predictably didn’t shut up and when the couple in front of them asked if she could be quiet the guy kicked off."
"5597","@StephGallardo @hitRECordJoe Yessss! #Looper! I couldn’t figure out the name lol but yes! You can tell that they really tried hard to get each other’s mannerisms down! It shows<U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> #Shazam!"
"5598","So I just got out of #Shazam.... It was funny and a tad over hyped. My kid definitely loved it and he doesn't like superhero movies so there's that.

But it wasn't bad and was good popcorn entertainment. This would've been a great Will Smith movie in the late 90's."
"5599","@stargazer0118 and it makes you wonder how somebody like the director of Shazam can make scary elements in the movie, but when it comes to Parademonds, they don't really look that scary...that's a problem"
"5600","the only two superhero movies to ever make me physically cry are deadpool 2 and shazam and that's all you need to know about me as a person"
"5601","i watched shazam <U+0F36><U+0DAC><U+0F1D><U+0DAC><U+0F36> the story, acting, and humor are all on point but most importantly the amount of heart and FOUND FAMILY™...  a bitch* was crying at the end

*me"
"5602","i'm... probably going to go see shazam again soon asldkfj it's everything i've ever wanted in a superhero movie"
"5603","jack dylan grazer is in shazam which reminded me (i never forgot) that we still have no it chapter 2 trailer"
"5604","Had to support my man @ZacharyLevi by seeing #shazam and it was awesome!"
"5605","@StephGallardo It was so much fun. The audience applauded quite vigorously. I'd say #Shazam is a true hit with movie goers."
"5606","#shazam has some nightmare fuel for kids. Intense scenes of people being cleay dying or not survive traumatic attacks. Not quite as family-safe as I expected. I enjoyed it as an adult but it earned PG-13."
"5607","Pls how good is that Shazam movie?"
"5608","@NoahShachtman @ShazamMovie he’s the real pure of heart"
"5609","okay change of plans shazam tomorrow"
"5610","ACTUALLY! #Shazam is the wizard. Your thinking of Shazam's Champion."
"5611","@ShazamMovie @dcumoviepage I’m happy for these kind of CBM’s to be successful &amp; exist the same way I’m happy for darker/grittier CBM’s to exist - why can’t we have both? @WarnerMediaGrp @wbpictures cater for both #ReleaseTheSnyderCut #ReleaseTheSnyderVersion #214Minutes #ItExists"
"5612","@ShazamMovie is the best DC movie yet... also better than a majority of Marvel movies"
"5613","Just got home from my 2nd viewing of Shazam,, even better a 2nd time imo"
"5614","Yes it is : An obese latino kid , a chinease kid , a black kid , a disabled kid , the dad seems to be metis. This the most diverse Superhero movie yet. Not Spider verse , Not black panther , but Shazam"
"5615","So I’m in the theater watching the start of Shazam and the power goes out due to a bad thunderstorm here in Austin. 

Hero of the theater yells SHAZAM! 

Everyone laughs, good joke"
"5616","Just watched @ShazamMovie i give it a solid 8/10. Def a good movie and fresh new take on DC films."
"5617","I was seeing #Shazam yesterday and i wanted to know one of the songs so i got out my phone (as non-distracting as i possibly could) and used that app Shazam to get the song. i fucking shazam'd Shazam."
"5618","@GraceRandolph I've always said it's because Zachary Levy isn't a good choice for Shazam and they've made it look too kiddy!"
"5619","@MoneyMontrell Now how ima Shazam when i only do that off sc lol"
"5620","Shazam! was so fun. @ZacharyLevi is an absolute gem and a delight to watch. Also I was so happy for Adam Brody’s surprise triumphant return to our screens and to our hearts #SethCohen4ever"
"5621","So I highly recommend it. Between Shazam!, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman Warner Brothers/DC are seeming to get their shit together and starting to understand why people love and connect with these characters in the first place. It’s about time."
"5622","Levi is fantastic as Shazam! and you can tell he’s having a lot of fun in this movie. But the MVPs are the kid actors, particularly Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer. I really dug their dynamic and they have wonderful chemistry."
"5623","So #shazam is 2 full hours of sheer joy. I fuckin’ loved it."
"5624","going to see shazam rn bye"
"5625","how many people are mad at shazam because it has flossing in it"
"5626","@jonskingdom im so bad with watching movies i should really watch more jdjd shazam is the first movie ive seen this year"
"5627","@ShazamMovie why is there so many 7s in this movie? That caught my eye....lol eye...watch the movie and you’ll understand. Great movie!"
"5628","@saegerart @BillyTucci @ShazamMovie @captainmarvel @Marvel @DCComics The latter. Disney and Sony actually make movies. AT&amp;T are  evil and screw people over with their terrible and overpriced service. It's like how Universal movies are now Comcast commercials. If WarnerMedia let Disney buy them instead of AT&amp;T, their movies would still be movies."
"5629","@gavinfeng97 ""But... But... But... Shazam was supposed to dominate at the box office because Billy Batson is the REAL #CaptainMarvel and Brie Larson is a sexist, racist SJW!""

In all seriousness, though, I'm happy for this. The more bombs WarnerMedia cranks out the sooner they'll escape AT&amp;T."
"5630","@BoxKev *****spoiler***** I lost my shit when the Shazam family popped up. Like legit lost it. Couldn’t believe they did it in the first movie"
"5631","I really enjoyed Shazam and I’m shocked they did THAT thing <U+0001F917><U+0001F92B>"
"5632","Shazam is DC's first good movie since The Dark Knight Rises and funny throughout."
"5633","@MovieEvangelist @cineworld Am v much looking forward to Shazam.  Did it live up to the promise of the trailer?"
"5634","@LazyGreyhound Are you going to see Shazam!? I thought it was great. <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"5635","Shazam! was cute, enjoyable and has a terrific third act. It's a fun family film but plays like one that'll cause impressionable kids to ruin their life pursuing a film career hoping to one day emulate the magical feeling of watching it. Irresponsible entertainment. Ban it now."
"5636","“Try sneezing or coughing in the middle of the word.”

         Trust her, she knows from personal experience it definitely stops the magic from happening."
"5637","Just saw @ShazamMovie with my two boys, and we all really loved it.  Glad to see @DCComics finally put out a solid movie, bravo!!"
"5638","Am I the only #comics #superhero #scifi fan not interested in #ShazamMovie?  But when does #AvengersEndgame open, and December can't come soon enough #EpisodeIX"
"5639","Currently watching"
"5640","@JonnyTwoBucks @YahooEnt @ShazamMovie Good point!   I guess I’d rather have a movie’s diversity pointed out to me after the fact instead of looking for points before it’s released."
"5641","I refuse to listen to any reviews for @ShazamMovie unless it was written by a current or former foster child.  @brielarson"
"5642","#Shazam was okay. I give it like a 6 out of 10. 

Pros:
-Good character interplay with believable dialogue
-Quite violent, gruesome and dark at times
-People/kids swear and flip people off
-In general quite mature and smart
-Jack Dylan Grazer is the best
-Genuinely heartfelt"
"5643","Cons:
-The Shazam suit is horrendous. The sculpt is good but the lack of proper detailing and shading makes it look embarassingly flat and cheap
-Levi never once behaved like a real human being 
-Mark Strong's accent
-I preferred the depiction of magic in Suicide Squad"
"5644","Just saw Shazam. I’m still not convinced that DC can make a good film this day and age."
"5645","@LazyAndroids @Partizan_Niksic Its there. If he didnt do the final editing or he really lied it aint matter to me bcos i was never on board with this funny asf shazam. I wanted to see the snyderverse shazam &amp; cavill supes vs  rockadam"
"5646","I wish Letterboxd would implement fractional ratings.  Sometimes, I want to rate a film in-between the integers and mixed numbers.

Ex: Shazam! for me gets a 3.8/5, so how do I rate it based on the current system? Do I just round to the nearest whole?"
"5647","@BlackMajikMan90 @AliGhezelbash @boxofficemojo I don't think Endgame is going to kill Shazam the way people are thinking it will. By then it will be 3 weeks later and will have made most of its hay already and after the 26th, it'll be everyone who isn't seeing Endgame is seeing Shazam."
"5648","@NotYoshihide @XanderMobusVO bruh name one thing that separates shazam from the past 10 superhero films released this last year."
"5649","It's 60 and sunny, what a good day to sit inside a movie theater for 2+ hours #Shazam"
"5650","the multiple-doors-leading-to-other-spaces scene in shazam! was basically a monsters inc. rip off"
"5651","#Shazam was actually pretty good. At least DC is starting to make decent movies again."
"5652","Couldn't have been a more perfect choice <U+0001F64C>"
"5653","We then went to baywalk to watch Shazam. They gave it 7/10, while i gave it 9/10. It was one hella good movie, DC is setting their bar higher now. Oh yeah and i just got home, watching midnight is not really my thing. But it's good tho for once in a while."
"5654","""Oh the rain seems to be letting up even though the tornado watch doesn't expire for another 3hrs, maybe I can go watch Shazam after all.""

*thunder rumbles*

...""nevermind"""
"5655","Another #Shazam tweet: saw this with my nephew and he walked out of it saying he has a new favorite superhero. I know it’s legit because he didn’t fall asleep during the movie for once."
"5656","Shazam is currently my favorite DC film.

Yes, I like it just as much if not more than Dark Knight. It's just that good."
"5657","@dayawidow The actor who plays Shazam"
"5658","@TheNerdCouncil_ Shazam dropped, I’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. My watch is ticking, a discussion is coming blood"
"5659","Bout to see if shazam is any good"
"5660","@HopeOfKrypton95 told you were going to love Shazam <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"5661","Also, John Glover has to hold the record for most DC projects acted in that are all different roles.

He was in -

• Smallville as Lionel Luthor
• Batman Animated Series as Riddler
• Batman and Robin as Scientist that tries to kill Poison Ivy at the beginning

And now Shazam!"
"5662","I’m making the mistake of being excited for this Joker movie.

But I should go see Shazam tonight off the solo tip. Don’t really go too long without seeing the superhero waves lol"
"5663","Haven’t seen #Shazam yet.  But most of the reviews are as follows.  The movie is actually pretty good.  But this movie indicates that the connected DC cinematic universe is dead.  Hail Hydra!"
"5664","First wonder woman then aquaman and now #ShazamMovie @DCComics is killing it lately."
"5665","@Scientits @AnnieMouse81 Shazam is just the best app ever. I’ve got 7 acts to explore and download after lunch today. And I learned that Ella Fitzgerald recorded Get Ready (I only knew the temptations and supremes versions) and it’s bloody epic."

"5669","Maybe later stream today? I'm watching SHAZAM! Oh snap! There are plenty of open seats, who's in?"
"5670","Shazam did so much in this movie, I wasn’t expecting it. The sequel is probably gonna take forever but it’ll be worth it"
"5671","@BlackAmerrika16 That’s part of Shazam’s allure, he’s cheesy by nature lol"
"5672","#Shazam is amazing absolutely blown away. Easily by far DC’s best."
"5673","@RothCornet will you guys have a Shazam spoiler review?"
"5674","#Shazam has the soul of Megamind. Both parts heartfelt and funny <U+2764>"
"5675","The best thing Shazam does is introduce me to Marta Milans because she is FINE as FUCK bro"
"5676","So @ShazamMovie is a lot of fun but seriously y’all we gotta stop with the montages set to “Don’t Stop Me Now” already."
"5677","Just saw the @ShazamMovie and it was amazing @ZacharyLevi you absolutely killed it #Shazam"
"5678","@ShazamMovie Enjoyed the movie. I'd like for @wbpictures not to put too much in the trailers. A lot of the cool scenes were no surprise because we've seen them already. Definitely looking forward to owning a copy of this movie tho."
"5679","Pleasantly surprised how much I liked #Shazam. Loved it in fact. DCeU is on a roll..."
"5680","Pleasantly surprised how much I liked #Shazam. Loved it, in fact."
"5681","Oh also Shazam’s good third best Christmas movie after gremlins and die hard"
"5682","#MovieReview time. 
Really enjoyed #Shazam a lot. A light-hearted, comedy superhero movie, like how it should be.
Finally, DCEU. Finally."
"5683","shazam was fucking amazing all of you should watch it and give it the attention it deserves"
"5684","#SHAZAM! Was a great movie. I was hesitant based on the trailer but I thoroughly enjoyed it, nice balance of humor, heart, and action"
"5685","Ill b honnest i rolled my eyes when i went to see shazam bc i wasnt enthusiastic abt watchin yet another formulaic superhero movie n u kno what. I got surprised its rly fun and has alot of heart and has thz vibe of a christmas straight to video movie and WHO doesnt love those"

"5692","@BrianOverBraun Almost got tix for the family to see Shazam today, but opted for tomorrow morning instead because I was concerned about exactly that."
"5693","@TheBlossomTwins @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @nbcchuck You guys are so pretty <U+2764>"
"5694","@goncasso_ @ShazamMovie I had to work then have to go back to SI. This was the only timing that worked for meeee"
"5695","15 minutes into @ShazamMovie and I'm already bored af."
"5696","@ShazamMovie Very good introduction to Shazam! Great story!  #Shazam"
"5697","wonder woman, shazam, &amp; birds of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one harley quinn
                       <U+0001F91D>
            saving the dceu"
"5698","@ZacharyLevi I'm super stoked. My sister, who became paralyzed over 2 years ago asked me if I wanted to see #Shazam since we have a wheelchair can rented for the weekend. This is her first movie in 3 years."
"5699","Went and saw @ShazamMovie today with my boys! EVERYTHING a superhero movie should be!! THE BEST DC movie so far. Defo on the right track here..my boys were laughing all the time! You tell me one person alive who wouldn’t abuse the powers when they first get them. I 100% would <U+0001F602>"
"5700","#NowWatching.@ShazamMovie for the second time!! Can’t wait to see if it lives up to the first time!"
"5701","His name is... Captain Sparklefingers! Sorry, no. Shazam! It’s Shazam! His name is Shazam. Don’t miss #Shazam in cinemas now."
"5702","If you haven't subscribed or made accounts on streaming sites, then do it now. Get shazam app, get Spotify and Apple music etc. Learn how to stream beforehand because we got to give it our all on the day, the week and the month. Get to know goals for your country or make some."
"5703","Shazam was amazing, totally recommend seeing it!"
"5704","I loved SHAZAM!!! I’m a big dc fan and it was really fun and refreshing to watch I hope more dc movies follow it <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+0001F389>"
"5705","So I liked most aspects of the Shazam movie, but disliked how they used legend by @twentyonepilots outside of it's beautiful context simply because it's  great content."
"5706","Watched the best panto I've seen before (The Lion King at The Lyceum Theatre) then the best kids movie I've seen in a while (Shazam). Both fun though. Worth a quid or two."
"5707","@SeanReli @GiteshPandya Looking at how audiences and critics reviewed it. I’d say Shazam also it’ll have better legs than Captain Marvel which had below average to average legs"
"5708","Just saw shazam what an inspiring Great movie I recommend you seeing it"
"5709","I forgot about this !! Now I can go to the movies again"
"5710","I’m about to watch Shazam bye<U+270C><U+FE0F>"
"5711","every theater in the area has 'Dumbo' playing every 45 minutes and the showings are all pretty much empty. 'Shazam' has maybe 5 showings all day at each theater and they're all sold out"
"5712","im treating myself to shazam bc of my favs debuting in unine <U+263A><U+FE0F><U+263A><U+FE0F> starting this journey off right"
"5713","@SteveHorrocks The struggle was real. No cell phones. No Shazam. You had to be at home and able to call the radio station and ask them what they just played."
"5714","Shazam! was actually a damn decent movie. My only complaint in the Movie is how meh the actions scenes were, but it was well acted, the humour was pretty spot on, and there were some neat surprises thrown in I did not expect. Also +10 Points for the actual Credit Sequence. Nice!"
"5715","Back from watching Shazam! and I still love Billy so much.
My precious troublemaking son!"
"5716","@googamp32 @BillyTucci @ShazamMovie @captainmarvel @Marvel @DCComics I don't mean to be argumentative, I just don't understand. Wouldn't this make every Sony movie a Sony commercial, every MCU movie a Disney corporation commercial, etc? Or is it just that AT&amp;T is worse than the other megacorps?"
"5717","Shazam has all the shenanigans and Found Family Tropes I want to see in my super hero movies. <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"5718","OMG that was such a good and fun movie. Highly recommend watching it #Shazam"
"5719","Just watched #Shazam with @ManBearHulk  that shit was funny and entertaining. Good movie. I'll be seeing it again next weekend for sure. #ShazamMovie"
"5720","Gonna get my #ShazamMovie review up tonight alone with my #cinemark theater review to #like and #subscribe to know what theaters to go to or to avoid."
"5721","dr sivana, shazam family, the entire plot, everything was good and all of the acting was on point, that’s the best dc movie ever made and I hope everyone recognizes it as it is: the superior hero movie of 2019,,,,, dont @ me"
"5722","@iNabberTV also zachary levi as shazam billy was literally the opposite of five from umbrella academy, both great performances but in terms of character"
"5723","#shazam was a great movie with a fun story, an awesome cast, and a great balance of humor with action. What I like the most is that it evokes a sense of magic and wonder that we should often have when thinking about superheroes. 8.5/10"
"5724","@The1stBAT @ZacharyLevi #WhenISayShazam my little Logan actually wants to go to the cinema and see it! Watch this space! @ShazamMovie looks great!"
"5725","@iafras I sorta remember Shazam. Wasn't there Isis too? I see there is a remake."
"5726","We got to see Shazam! this morning and it was really good.  Likely my favorite DC movie. :D  Why?  Because it's ONE movie, not multiple movies crammed into one.  I'd say Aquaman was my second favorite, even if it did have too much content, then Wonder Woman."
"5727","The homie: “do we have to watch Shazam! before Endgame?” 

<U+0001F480> smh"
"5728","#Shazam gets points from me for having a supervillain named Thad."
"5729","I want a massive alert when this happens"
"5730","@ZacharyLevi you were so awesome as #Shazam! The movie was so good! I had a smile on my face for the entire movie. It really brought back the feelings from my childhood when I wondered what it would be like if I became a superhero. Well done!"
"5731","So... why isn’t anyone talking about #Shazam introducing the DCEU’s first LGBTQ character?

And sorry, I know Harley is LGBTQ in the comics, but it’s not been confirmed in the movies yet."
"5732","Even cartoons we used to watch in our childhood were better then SHAZAM. #Shazam #shazamsucks #dccomics"
"5733","Outside is raining, and I just heard a big thunder. I think someone just yell the spell 

#ShazamMovie 
#Shazam"
"5734","@NOTBOBPARR Maybe 8/10 if I was diehard Shazam fan and could critic the origins more but beginning and character development was quick and slim. Ending was dope tho"
"5735","Just saw Shazam 

By far the best DC Universe movie. Had a lot of action and fun. I recommend it."
"5736","Shazam was fucking amazing and Zachary levi nailed it, that shit was hilarious."
"5737","So excited, finally watching my favorite person @ZacharyLevi #Shazam"
"5738","Shazam most overrated superhero movie of all time I think.

The older actors were terrible and the costume design... a nightmare"
"5739","@ScornComiX @ShazamMovie The cafeteria part. The other portion of the ending was already foreshadowed"
"5740","Why are people pitting Shazam against Captain Marvel? Yes Shazam is the original Captain Marvel but both films are completely different. Just enjoy them for what they are and stop moaning."
"5741","This great fan believed the 'M' in Shazam should honour one if not the greatest frontmen: Freddie Mercury. What a great idea! After all, he was a rock god. I vote: 'Yes'"
"5742","@ZacharyLevi Can I just say: WOW!!! @ShazamMovie is the BEST movie I have seen in a while. How much fun was that!!!!! Thank you for some levity."
"5743","God laid it on my <U+2764><U+FE0F> to pray &amp; encourage @zacharylevi in April 2016. Those in the entertainment biz can face opposition simply by sharing their craft. Let’s encourage them, pray for them &amp; support their talent. (1 Tim 2:1) #stillpraying #openingweekend #ShazamMovie #ZacharyLevi"
"5744","@dafeakpomie @danicious_dan @Wana____ Shazam’s hero is actually called Captain Marvel, there are lots of “Captain Marvel” and there’s also Captain Mar-Vell<U+0001F601>"
"5745","@LB_Fenrir so should I live tweet my bootlegs of #Shazam followed by #PetSemetary on this account or my other one"
"5746","@LB_Fenrir why not shazam too? I use fake hashtags so people can mute it"
"5747","""Say my name so my powers may flow through you.""
I love this line so much, my favorite through the entire movie! #Shazam"
"5748","I'm waiting on the #Shazam review of Funhaus"
"5749","Ok, saw #Shazam yesterday. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again. Shazam was in my Top 3 growing up behind Supes and Green Lantern."
"5750","@IVSoftware Hey, did you guys know that Uplink gets a very brief mention in the new Shazam movie? I was so excited when I heard it :-)"
"5751","Shazam is such a quality DC movie <U+0001F37F>"
"5752","The 5 minute footage that met showd of Godzilla: King Of The Monsters before Shazam was glorious and featured some godly visual rendering especially on the monsters. Setting a countdown timer for May 31st pronto"
"5753","just saw shazam and it was fucking perfect. we stan a captain sparkle fingers

#ShazamMovie"
"5754","it’s a possible sequel tease with mister mind. what else is there to explain lol.

anyway, if shazam ever gets a sequel, they NEED to up the budget. esp if the shazam family becomes a regular thing. shazam deserved a higher budget with better CGI <U+0001F615>"
"5755","The marketing was done poorly, and it’s release is a lot more dangerous than Shazam’s. At least Shazam has three weeks to make good money before Endgame comes out."
"5756","#Shazam is actually the darkest DCEU film if you really think about it."
"5757","@Sambel08 I am good too :) just finish a movie (Shazam) and now is already 4am I still can’t sleep <U+0001F634>"
"5758","Shazam ultimately works because it relishes in the reality of a kid who has nothing being given the chance to be a superhero with everything"
"5759","The movie was funny and amazing and I hope they'll make a sequel with black Adam.

#Shazam"
"5760","Just saw #Shazam. Story wise, the film had a few flaws? It didn’t feel super cohesive and there were pacing issues, but the dialogue definitely delivered. Overall, it’s a fresh take on the “superhero” genre and a standout in the DCEU. Would recommend <U+0001F44D><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"5761","@snyder_cut @DCComics @ShazamMovie That is not the mid-credits scene."
"5762","cuz u say shazam and immediately changes so,,,"
"5763","loved Shazam, went beyond my expectations. 8.5/10 <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+0001F919><U+0001F3FE>"
"5764","Love the DEEP cut credit scene too, that was really cool #Shazam"
"5765","It's a DC movie so it probably means something that will never actually happen. <U+0001F923>"
"5766","What @ZacharyLevi portrays in #Shazam is literally me every single day, minus the superhero stuff. Nothing but a sheer bliss!!"
"5767","That is legitimately some of the best Superman writing I've seen in years."
"5768","The last scene in shazam is the most unnecessary thing in cinema history."
"5769","So #SHAZAM and his friends turn into power rangers at the end <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>wow who knew"
"5770","#Shazam was a great movie!
10/10 would recommend."
"5771","the shazam family was incredible. i want to see more of them."
"5772","shazam was such a fun, heartwarming movie. it’s definitely my favorite movie in the dceu."
"5773","Me and Dylan Thaught we be great and book the dearest tickets for the opening night of Shazam and spent loads on popcorn andall aswell and OF COURSE I fall asleep for the whole movie and wake up in the last 5 minutes after spending 70 euro ;("
"5774","Okay Shazam was amazing!!!!! 9 out of 10 no doubt about it. The suit looks 10 times better in the movie than it ever did in pictures!! Levi pulled it off with the funny part but also the serious moments plus being awesome as a superhero!! The kid was great, all the kids were!!"
"5775","About to watch SHAZAM"
"5776","I had the opportunity to see @ShazamMovie a couple of weeks ago and it very pleasantly surprised. If this is a sign of the DCEU to come Marvel better look out!"
"5777","SHAZAM is the perfect superhero film. Fun, wholesome, and never a dull moment. Please go see this movie. 9.5/10"
"5778","@ShazamMovie very entertaining. Funny, heartfelt, with a little bit of scare. Easily top 2 @DCComics movies. This universe!"
"5779","Tomorrow I’ll be going to see Shazam at the same cinema, that superhero comedy film."
"5780","Saw #ShazamMovie last night with my kids. It was good old-fashioned superhero fun. Was much better than I expected."
"5781","might just go and see shazam myself since no one i know is interested"
"5782","@LandsharkRides I thought the foster home stuff and Shazam!-cripple kid scenes were very fun."
"5783","@HMX551 I mean that's very true, but also Shazam isn't some indie movie that gets released nowhere and therefore nobody sees, its a big DC superhero action movie thats actually for once good, and it's gonna be outmatched in the studios by dumb  fucking water boy."
"5784","The rules of my local movie theatre are disgusting. How am I supposed to tell my lizards that we can’t see Shazam"
"5785","@Zakiyyah6 Legit had this convo with a friend on Thursday night at theater before shazam"
"5786","My review of #ShazamMovie in sum: A not-dark, not brown, not depressing DCU movie... More cringe-comedy than my usual taste but enjoyable nonetheless."
"5787","@Rotful_ @ShazamMovie You’re missing a good film."
"5788","@BTSxNortheast @BTS_twt This is my least fave platform but I realize how important is so I do it for my boys<U+0001F49C>

"5789","I found Trench cute after watching #Shazam"
"5790","#Shazam was so good! Easily one of the best DC movies so far!"
"5791","Shazam! It's very fun! And it has a genuinely great villain. Every kid in my cinema was delighted by this film. I expect it to be like Sky High in that it will be your favourite movie in the universe if you're 7."
"5792","#Shazam had darker moments than Snyder did tf these people watching."
"5793","it actually hasn’t been that consistent since Snyder. I know we’re only technically 2 &amp; a half movies out of that Snyder tone but I’d still believe it if you put likes of Shazam &amp; Joker in the same universe. I mean look @ the DCU &amp; DCAU?! They do it all the time!"
"5794","@Frankiegunn Go see Shazam.  I saw it a couple weeks ago in one of the advanced screenings.  Really good!"
"5795","@ShazamMovie was everything I hoped it would be! Charming, cheerful, surprisingly funny, and with a great third act that managed to subvert the usual superhero movie tropes in a delightful manner! @ponysmasher has knocked it out of the park on this one. Can't wait for a sequel!"
"5796","@AngryJoeShow All I can say is Shazam! is AWESOME. I just saw it and man it’s by far the best superhero movie I’ve seen in years"
"5797","I just watched #Shazam again. . . and I can see myself going to watch it one more time! So good!! So fun!!!"
"5798","I’m about to see #ShazamMovie I’ll tweet my thoughts shortly after"
"5799","Shazam was fun. The promotion for this film is really doing it a disservice."
"5800","@PeteSpideyTalk I personally dislike New 52 Shazam but still can enjoy this movie on its own merits.

The real problem is that they stripped away the heroism and purity of the character. He's no longer a character we aspire to, but one we're meant to relate to. That's not CM to a lot of people."
"5801","Just got out of Shazam. Damn it’s a great film. Definitely in the right vein of the comics (new 52 and older)."
"5802","Captain Marvel/#Shazam can never tell his name in public. One is becoz of Marvel , the other name will reveal his identity."
"5803","Shazam! is just a really good fun time at the movies. 

<U+0001F60D>And one of the most creative end credits you’ll ever see <U+0001F60D>"
"5804","#shazam is AMAZINGGGGG. Watched it for the second time and I can’t believe how much I missed the first time around"
"5805","Btw i went and saw Shazam alone and loved every second of it. Go see it."
"5806","SHAZAM! was a seriously fun movie!! I loved it and I cannot wait to see what lies in the future!! <U+0001F604><U+0001F329> @ShazamMovie #SHAZAM"
"5807","Glad to finally get to see a movie for one of my favorite Superheroes; Shazam!"
"5808","#Shazam makes DC movies fun again, and proves that you can have a serious, consistent message without having to be grimdark in the process"
"5809","SHAZAM made me so happy that I got tears in my eyes."
"5810","Same! I’m tired of the white boy who has a great destiny but all the people of color around him are superior. I’m over that shot i don’t care if there is a diverse cast stop making it about the mediocre white man!"
"5811","I'm jealous of all the kids who will run around screaming Shazam because the movie brought the character into the mainstream.  #WhenISayShazam people look at me funny."
"5812","Saw #Shazam last night and really really really liked it.

Really fun and funny, but there were emotional moments so real I had to cover my face.

Scary scenes brought to mind Raimi Spider-Man.

Mark Strong as Sivana is the closest thing we have to a good Lex Luthor right now."
"5813","Never wasting time huh, you know where to find me when I’m bored &amp; wanted to get entertained<U+0001F389><U+0001F3AC><U+0001F483><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F483><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F483><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F483><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F483><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F3AC><U+0001F389> — watching Shazam! Movie"
"5814","The current state of the DCEU means I’ve come to the cinema alone for the first time ever in order to watch Shazam. God dammit Martha!"
"5815","delighted to see that shazam! is continuing the epcu (exclamation point cinematic universe) that started with mother!"
"5816","delighted to see that shazam! is continuing the exclamation point cinematic universe that originated with mother!"
"5817","@ponysmasher good sir you have made my childhood a reality, I’ve waited for a Shazam movie for years and so happy that it didn’t just meet my expectations, but exceeded them. Definitely going to rewatch it again before it leaves theaters, also @ZacharyLevi was born for the role"
"5818","My mom won’t see Shazam without me. So we’re going to go see it together next time I go home. <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"5819","@DiscussingFilm They're only saying that since Endgame is their last film for the MCU and also because of the success of Aquaman and Shazam"
"5820","@Blackcatsweb @VPrim4 @geiser_gregory @NetflixFilm @TheJoeGil @brielarson @RottenTomatoes Thanks for the reminder ! Picking you up soon for #Shazam"
"5821","Ok girlies, we’re doing a Shazam/Us double feature"
"5822","In fact, I think #shazam has been the best superhero movie. Actually felt drawn in and emotionally invested in the characters. @ZacharyLevi is a perfect fit @AsherAngel , @Jgrazerofficial, @FaitheHerman , all of em, did great. Faith has some of the best lines"
"5823","Hey @ZacharyLevi, I saw @ShazamMovie today and just wanted to tell ya how much fun it is! Kudos all around. Hope to see you here in ATL @DragonCon this fall."
"5824","Watched Shazam (Enjoyed it) watch it at Cineworld at White Rose Shopping Centre then to City centre got things I bought from Ebay at argus store. had Sausage Sandwhich &amp;amp; ham &amp;amp; cheese toastie from Greggs and then y Popcorn and nachos at cinema I wa full up."
"5825","Drop everything and go see #Shazam"
"5826","Be sure to check out this sale while it lasts!"
"5827","Sis and I are going to see #Shazam tonight. She's suggesting we hit #CheeseFactory before. Both sound like excellent reasons to leave the house. #LazySaturday"
"5828","Was hoping to have time for a haircut before going to pick up sis for #Shazam but the hair place is full and it's getting late...

As Shaina Twain would say, ""damm, I feel like a woman"""
"5829","Saw Shazam. It's weird because it starts out with a tone that you don't expect it to have, then ramps things up to comic book AWESOME!!!

This lion recommends seeing it."
"5830","I didn't really like Shazam. Most of the movie was spent on him showing off and it only peaked towards the end. Even the personalities didn't match Billy and Shazam. I was really hoping it would be as good as WW and Aquaman.

6/10 for me <U+0001F622>"
"5831","In my opinion
Shazam had one of the best 3rd acts in a DCEU movie"
"5832","I judge movies by length. Movies should be at least 2 hours. Why are some 100 minutes. I feel they are cheating me . Tomorrow Shazam  good length movie #movies #moviereviews #ShazamMovie g"
"5833","all people are watching shazam and im here like <U+0001F494>"
"5834","@COFFINBORNEGOD Ahh damn they showed the trailer in front Shazam huh. Damnit I was hoping to avoid seeing it"
"5835","@WitneySeibold you were right about #SHAZAM.  It truly is the best superhero film since “Spider-Man 2”.  Fun, funny, but with an emotional core and relatable characters."
"5836","@ponysmasher can you please add back all of the times when the John Williams Superman theme plays in “SHAZAM!”?"
"5837","In a Captain Marvel/Shazam kind of mood and decided to rewatch the Justice League Unlimited episode that he appeared in. Honestly. Superman was a total dick! I would have quit the League too! <U+0001F602>"
"5838","#Shazam was a good movie... but tired of these comedic super hero movies. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"5839","I'm going to see #Shazam this afternoon in theatres so I will tweet out my thoughts about the movie later :D"
"5840","Shazam was unexpectedly wavy btw... There's a scene in the final act that blew my nerd mind away.

Also because a certain black qween just appeared randomly Lool. Easily my favorite character"
"5841","Want to know the worst thing about seeing this movie?

That the cinema was rather empty considering how much better a movie this was compared to Captain Marvel which was sold-out.

If you went to see that and not this, then you can't complain about mediocre movies in the future."
"5842","@philzgray omg yesss. I'm going to see shazam tonight <U+0001F61D><U+0001F440>"
"5843","2 days late on taking this but I got everything right lol. I'm so curious about the title track for @BTS_twt upcoming album. Well, I'm curious about all of it."
"5844","Didn’t have high hopes for Shazam!, but ended up really enjoying it! It was really weird how things kept going horror, but otherwise, fun ride!"
"5845","@Little_Zack I'd say both Wonder Woman and Shazam and better than most MCU movies and Aquaman is just as good as a lot of them."
"5846","@Little_Zack I'd say both Wonder Woman and Shazam are better than most MCU movies and Aquaman is just as good as a lot of them."
"5847","shazam is shameless in being a pure superhero movie i love it. like, truly great. i only wish the main villains of this one had designs that were a little less...generic? but the ending stuff implied that they would go in more interesting directions with that anyways"
"5848","This is soo interesting :o"
"5849","good try, marketing ppl. we only acknowledge the existence of the one TRUE Shazam."
"5850","#shazam !!!!! @Dolliah and I loved it! @ZacharyLevi you and the whole cast were phenomenal. I loved it! @ponysmasher amazing job! Thank you all for bringing this character to life."
"5851","@sweet_sydk Both Darla and Mary were more suitable heirs to the power of Shazam."
"5852","Shazam was fine the humor was very cringe, and the slow motion was Batman vs Superman tier of terrible"
"5853","Theses folks really got me out her going to see another superhero movie <U+0001F37F>.... #Shazam"
"5854","This really says a lot about society."
"5855","Just saw #Shazam it was a fantastic movie! Great mix of comedy and action! 10/10 would recommend! Be sure to stick around til the end!"
"5856","Shazam better than Justice League. Wonder Woman. All that shit. And its not even a hour in."
"5857","Went and saw Shazam and it was great! So happy to see my favorite super hero in a movie. <U+0001F329><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"5858","[Watching Shazam]

Me: This is basically what would have happened if Tom Hanks was bitten by Zoltar in Big.

My son: Are you even speaking English right now??"
"5859","SHAZAM!
*lightning crack, phone rings*
""This is a notice that Mr. Shazam is due for Jury Duty on Tuesday, also you owe $1,200 to the IRS in tax-"""
"5860","Listen shazam was one of the best dc movie iv ever seen!! Woow it beat my expectation hell its going into my top favorite super hero movies !!! Woow 
10/10 cute as fuck left the theater with a smiling face !!"

"5862","@CavernOfShame @winebibbing @furrythug Just did that to Shazam!  Really enjoyed it."
"5863","seen today: missing link &amp; shazam. two great films. missing link was sweet &amp; funny &amp; beautifully animated. kids in the audience really seemed to enjoy the violence."
"5864","shazam is surprisingly touching and fun too. could do without some uncool imagery regarding disability &amp; careless use of slurs for disabled ppl by a non-disabled actor. still nice to see a disabled character having a good time in a film. what can ya do <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F><U+26A1>"
"5865","The premise of #ShazamMovie - Billy Batson as a troubled foster kid who uses becoming a superhero as a way of escaping from his problems - is really solid. But it's never as fully explored as it needs to be. Billy's growth feels more informed than earned."
"5866","#ShazamMovie is very sweet and funny, but it does more to point out a viable direction for DC movies than get there itself."
"5867","Like Wonder Woman, #ShazamMovie tries to offer an alternative to previous DC movies' grim self-seriousness by facing heartbreak head-on. But it's not as good at this as WW was."
"5868","Same goes for the villain, who has a compelling origin story that might have made him a complicated character. But the film never really goes anywhere with this. It gestures at some interesting ideas and then leaves them there. #ShazamMovie"
"5869","Anyway, I don't want to come down too hard. It is a sweet film with good intentions and a good message. But it's trying to be something more, and it doesn't quite get there. #ShazamMovie"
"5870","#Shazam was really good. I’d say it’s second to Wonder Woman as far as recent DCU movies are concerned."

"5883","Oh, what a marvel Shazam is (absolutely not sorry)! So sweet. Takes a little bit to get going, but when it does it just keeps on being a such an earnest delight.

Gotta hand it to DC: they're killing it. Who'da thought all it would take is letting these characters be themselves?"

"5897","Knowing exactly what building this is that he’s jumping off of changes this scene completely... the outright symbolism of his leap here and where he’s going (after what just happened prior to it)?

The beauty of the shots is amplified by the narrative <U+0001F44F>"
"5898","@GenericName0042 @doppelgangbangr @DCComics @ShazamMovie I haven't kept up on SHAZAM over the years, but I still remember he loses a certain percentage of his own powers for doing it unless that restrictions has been retconned like Wonder Woman's magic clay-to-life history."
"5899","Kinda ironic Shazam and Captain Marvel just happened to have their movie debut at the same time"
"5900","I’m thinking about going to Shazam. To anyone who has seen it, is it actually really good? Or are people just hyping it up due to the fact that it’s not as bad as other dc movies"
"5901","#Shazam was the most run I've had in a superhero movie maybe ever."
"5902","@IGN Shazam is superior than Captain Marvel"
"5903","Saw #Shazam which was a good adaptation of the original Captain Marvel, who is never referred to by that name, since there was this other movie featuring another comic book publisher’s hero with that same name. Captured the essence of the character."
"5904","I cried during the opening of #Shazam. One of my favorite heroes is Billy Batson, and they did him as right as Deadpool. They captured the essence of family that has been with the big cheese since the 40's, and how deep down, all kids have that superhero within.

Darla is amazing"
"5905","what in the fresh hell"
"5906","everyone please do me a favor and go watch shazam now in theaters <U+0001F5E3><U+0001F5E3><U+0001F5E3><U+203C><U+FE0F><U+203C><U+FE0F>"

Not entirely sure it knew who it was appealing to really."

"5911","@ByaruhangaAnita I won't lie Marvel is killing it but there's a lot of depth to some of the DC movies (obviously excluding the nonsensical ones like Shazam) and deep down we all love an underdog story."
"5912","@SNatuhamya Shazam especially. The trailers felt lackluster, hopefully there's something in the movie to save it. Yet to watch it. Aquaman was a 50-50 for me, it was a beautiful movie but not very interesting. Am sure if we asked @ByaruhangaAnita though, that 50-50 would be closer to a 90%."
"5913","Just saw #Shazam! It's definitely not like any other DC movie out now, and is a lot of fun. Kids and comic book fans will definitely love it. It's not my personal favorite of the DC movies, but it's such a breath of fresh air in their universe."
"5914","So excited to see @ShazamMovie tomorrow!!!"
"5915","@ZacharyLevi actually did the voice of #Shazam in the @LEGO_Group #DCsupervillians video game!"
"5916","I just saw @CassandraEbner and @RealJohnGlover in @ShazamMovie and they were awesome!"
"5917","Lol they made a Shazam movie like wtf is he gunna hold himself up to the speaker in a restaurant to find out which Ed Sheeran song  is playing?"
"5918","There's a scene in Shazam where a little boy drops his fighting Superman and Batman dolls to watch Shazam vs Dr Sivanna fight. It's the metaphor for the new DC Universe. Fun, hilarious superhero movie. #Shazam #ShazamMovie @sewetronica"
"5919","Just got back from watching @ShazamMovie. Hands down that's gotta be the best movie I've seen so far this year. Great job to @ZacharyLevi on fulfilling every child's dream."

"5921","@GenericName0042 @DCComics @ShazamMovie It would be such a cool idea to make them heroes as well though. Very interesting. Definitely looking forward to the next movie, my son loved it."
"5922","Verdict: #Shazam is really fun! I enjoyed watching that! Has some slow moments but it helps build the world and you care for the characters a bit more. It’s like if the movie BIG was made into a superhero! Even has a nice nod to BIG in there. Definitely recommend. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"

"5926","@HARPlELADY Horrific opinion Shazam is the real sauce"
"5927","Shazam was a better tribute to classic/cheesy Superman than any attempt at forcing dceu Superman to act like him ever was. In this essay I will explain why I think it would have been just perfect to have dceu Superman, a hero who’s been through tough times and"
"5928","these shorts are kinda cheesy but the art style is so vintage and adorable, so i can't not recommend them"
"5929","@jullllllieeee Watched Shazam at the theater"
"5930","Was gonna go see Shazam, but they have it in the expensive theater [with unnecessary vibrating seats], so I'm gonna wait and see if it moves to the cheap seats, next week after Hellboy comes out."
"5931","hey the shazam movie was really good?  and refreshing?  and had a lot of good humor without getting in the way of the more dramatic elements?? it was basically everything i could ask for with the property"
"5932","just went and saw shazam... recommend it"
"5933","@Zakiyyah6 Haven’t seen Shazam, but I’d say the other two are better than about half, 2/3s if I’m being generous. They’re both great, but I do feel they have flaws that are often glossed over.

The DCEU is on a good path, though. I won’t take that away."
"5934","Credits were the best part of Shazam. Easily."
"5935","Thirteen! Seriously. Why don’t parents pay attention to ratings? (Because they’re biased and inconsistent)"
"5936","Kept thinking that the kid playing Billy in Shazam could be Ryan in an OC prequel. Then, at the end, when the kid playing Freddy was transformed into a grownup hero, he was played by Seth from the OC."
"5937","LMAO This guy gets it! <U+26A1>"
"5938","Just saw Shazam and it was amazing. I love Zachary Levi. He’s been one of my fave actors for a while now."

"5944","Call me greedy but I'm so ready for a sequel. Want more wise-cracking brilliance from the @ZacharyLevi as the hero coming to grips with his powers, skillfully directed by @ponysmasher. Would so love to see the teen in a grown-mans body try deal with @GalGadot showing up.. #Shazam"
"5945","With the truly fantastic @ShazamMovie, @ponysmasher has crafted something ridiculously super fun. @ZacharyLevi is at his wise-cracking best in a movie that's Big meets Donner's Superman. Even better on repeat. Roll on the Wonder Woman &amp; Aquaman team-up movie...... #Shazam 
4.25<U+2B50><U+FE0F>"
"5946","Goodness, @ShazamMovie is truly awesome. From @ponysmasher directing to @ZacharyLevi to such great support including @AsherAngel, @Jgrazerofficial, @gracecfulton, Djimon Hounsou &amp; Mark Strong. Roll on the chance to see Zevi's wise cracking hero back on screen.. #Shazam"
"5947","Enjoyed the highly imaginative triumph. It's superhero action thats Big meets Richard Donner's Superman with more than a hint of family drama &amp; horror. @ZacharyLevi &amp; @AsherAngel both charm &amp; shine as the teen turned adult wise-cracker coming to terms with being a hero.. #Shazam"

"5950","Just saw Shazam and omfg it was so fucking good. I highly recommend seeing it."
"5951","So since Zack left DCEU/MCU 2.0 movies have opened to $93.8M $67M and $51M. Amazing progress. Next one will probably open with $20M. #Shazam failed to be top movie in China, first comic book movie since Ghost Rider 2 that failed to do it hahahaha #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"

"5953","Me: Can’t wait to go home and play as Shazam in Injustice 2 and ooooh right he died in Injustice 1."
"5954","I’m torn about Shazam the more I think about it. The strongest feeling is “this shows the potential of a sequel and of the DCEU”. But I feel like people have been saying that since Wonder Woman."
"5955","@GigawattConduit It's a little weird that they decided to do the ""fight different versions of ourselves"" thing with MK11, because the logical next step for Injustice 3 seemed to be Crisis on Infinite Earths. Granted one is a time story and the other is a space story.

Gimme Shazam family in I3."
"5956","@Ms_3K20 Just got off work relaxing then maybe Shazam"
"5957","@UncleWeezley Hahaha there’s really nothing to spoil though. I doubt anyone was a big Shazam fan before the movie"

"5959","#Shazam’s big secret is not going to last long so I must insist you experience the pop culture redemption surprise that made the gays and girls in my theater shriek"
"5960","@WeaponizedRage I saw Shazam and it was fun.  It was nice to see a superhero movie that was silly.  Superheroes are silly when you think about it."
"5961","I just came back from seeing #Shazam.  It was a fun movie that I recommend seeing.  Stay through the credits.  There's a mid-credits scene and post credits scene."

"5963","@MrProduction8 What happened in Shazam?"
"5964","Shazam! Was pretty good, although I found it kinda funny how the Avengers Endgame trailer got way more cheers and claps than Shazam at the end lol"
"5965","@ShazamMovie you surprised me with the ending!  Also 10/10 really good movie!"
"5966","Ok this may be a weird question but there's a line in #ShazamMovie where after leaving the club Pedro says that he doesn't think that was for him, so did @DCComics just sneak their first #LGBTQ superhero into a mainstream movie without telling anybody?"
"5967","I only go to #pacsun to Shazam their music and wear clothes I can’t buy"

"5971","Am I the only one who was a little bored through #shazam ? I'm seeing a lot of positive reviews. Took half the movie to get to a fight scene and all the jokes were directed at 15 year Olds.. How much is @TheDCEU paying to keep these reviews so good?"
"5972","Well, both kids saw Shazam and LOVED it. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D> We're going to see it next weekend, because I'm sick of going to a packed theater.  *Really* wish you could stream new movies immediately. <U+0001F61E>"
"5973","@MOVIEFAN99_ @SoulSurge100 I liked both of those movies (Aquaman cuz it’s weird as fuck and WW because I love the directing and writing) but Shazam isn’t unnecessarily weird but it’s also great in terms of directing/writing and the performances are excellent"
"5974","I just wanna emphasise how awesome #Shazam is @ponysmasher is a genius, it felt like an 80’s Spielberg movie! @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @jackdgrazer and the rest of the cast should be so proud of themselves!!!"

"6021","Shazam was the best superhero movie in this decade"
"6022","Thanks so much @ponysmasher  for nailing #Shazam and for being a real inspiration to young filmmakers out there. The directing Annabelle vids have become a bible!! @ShazamMovie reminds me of why I fell in love with cinema - action, humour, scary and so much heart. Loved it!!"
"6023","Opinions?"
"6024","#Shazam is great. Tons of humor and heart, cute DC references and deconstructed myth and gods of the DC universe like Deadpool did, with a PG focus. All works. A blast of fresh air. @ZacharyLevi"
"6025","The score was okay to me,  not  something that too impactful just Like skylar Grey's song for aquaman Ost &amp; Black Manta BGM,  But I was glad Twenty One Pilot - Legend was included in this movie, I instantly recognize it <U+0001F60E> without need to use #Shazam (pun intended)"
"6026","The foster family,  the kids version of shazam's family was really well picked,  while the rest favour darla which is undeniable,  Im more to Eugene since all his line &amp; game reference really hit me esp the first appearance he made on the movie , I totally can relate it <U+0001F602>"
"6027","Non spoiler review :Shazam was worth watching tho it isnt like aquaman  which has more CBM vibe to it since well it has more bigger budget,  @ZacharyLevi has done fantastic job as the adult  version of Billy Batson, Ive never seen this guy act before but to me it is well deliver"
"6028","Just like the rest,  The boardroom scene are my fav,  &amp; I was shocked since it was supposed to be ""family-friendly"" Movie , Just like the trench scene of James wan's aquaman , that scene definately will be the iconic scene of @ponysmasher 's #Shazam"

2. Shazam- Fun, hilarious, and wonderfully cheesy.
3. Aquaman- Funny, fun, but not devoid of emotion or stakes. Also black manta was a fantastic villain. 
4. Man Of Steel- A true epic defined by fantastic visuals..."
"6044","@ShazamMovie Loved the film"

"6050","Watched @ShazamMovie and whoaaaa!  It was really good.. @DCComics is really improving.."
"6051","@Legendary @wbpictures I went to go see Shazam in IMAX and they didn’t play the Godzilla KOTM footage"
"6052","Has not been since Suicide Squad and Han Solo that I had as many goose bumps.  Shazam!!!!!!  I loved it so much.    He is a character I have always been fascinated with since the 70s TV show.  Since them I have every single comic and seeing on screen simply made me HAPPY!"
"6053","Just caught @ShazamMovie in the theaters. Enjoyed it!"
"6054","@ZacharyLevi So for my anniversary,  my significant other got me a few Pop figures (I collect them). And he did not get the one of you! <U+0001F62D> I told him I think we need to see other people, Haha. #Shazam #ZacharyLeviFan"
"6055","yo me and my friend were going to see Us and then Shazam back to back but since Us is rated R we can’t see it since we’re babies so he tried to use tickets for Shazam to sneak in but that starts at 7 so she can’t let us in so what the fuck do we do"
"6056","@KivaBay Shazam found a really nice median between 'big superhero epic' and 'weird little indie throwback film that people only find out about two years after it comes out'. Kinda felt like what Disney tried to do with Spider-Man and the Ant-Man movies but like... Actually good."
"6057","Please don't go to leisure mall to see Shazam 
Ticket is 2000 minis popcorn and drink 

You're welcome"
"6058","#Shazam... is the 2nd best DCEU movie. Didn't have the highs of Wonder Woman, but also didn't have the lows of it either. Pretty middle of the road the entire time. Not great but definitely not bad! I enjoyed it. Was fun!"
"6059","@PNemiroff The look on Shazam’s face when he first goes into the strip club"

And I did sing “We got Jared!”
Out loud."
"6068","@ShazamMovie Was an absolute delight. I cannot wait to see more. Bring on the Black Adam! Philly represent! @RalphGarman"
"6069","@CDawsonAuthor I liked it better than Aquaman. Aquaman was too much for me. Shazam is more subtle, more ""low profile"". I'm planning on seeing it again. It's bright DC, without becoming Marvel."

"6071","don't know about the hero. Not only will you end up learning about him/her, but you may enjoy the movie. This has happened to me with #BlackPanther, #CaptainMarvel and now this. 

I understand why Shazam is popular now and I hope his fans are happy with the movie they got.

"6078","@Dn90t I'm really looking forward to seeing Shazam, it looks REALLY good, and one of the things that appeals to me about it is that it feels very different in trailers than what I'm used to from MCU. I like MCU, but I don't need more of it."

"6106","the best part of shazam are the actors, they all did a great job."
"6107","@JonsCrazyTweets We got through Captain Marvel. Excellent Avengers puzzle piece. It was late, so Shazam stayed on the “watchlist”."
"6108","Shazam had no right to be that much fun."
"6109","Most reviews I’ve seen are all “Yes, it’s a DC movie, but ‘SHAZAM!’ doesn’t suck *nearly* as much as we were expecting! Three stars!”"
"6110","@heyalexdaily I liked Wonder Woman in the theater, but didn’t see anything in the Shazam trailers to entice me on this one."
"6111","This movie is so good, everyone should watch it. Seriously, do go watch it"
"6112","@YahooEnt Shazam is an example of greater directorial freedom, smart character writing, and a huge amount of thought put into choosing the right actor for the right role. 

Shazam wasn’t perfect, but it was excellent."
"6113","Just watched Shazam, I have to say they did a good job on it."
"6114","I took my wife and young son halfway across the state to see #Shazam @BransonIMAX (largest screen in Midwest).

Billy walking through the throne room gave me goosebumps.  Great film!  Well done by all!"
"6115","@MazeDaMouth Do they call him Shazam or Captain Marvel in the movie?"
"6116","They used to be the same name at some point"
"6117","I wonder if they just made a movie called shazam to cover up that the sinbad shit actually happened <U+0001F914>"
"6118","My favorite part of #Shazam! was when when Thanos's snapped wiped away half the DC universe too."
"6119","Shazam was as fun and dumb as I needed it to be."
"6120","people associate copyright with preventing the creation of fan spinoffs and sampled music but it also blocks derivative works like an open source shazam-style song identifier"
"6121","Leaving for #Shazam in 10 minutes. I don’t do this a lot but @ponysmasher, you and your movies have meant so much to me over the years. I’m truly excited to see what you have in store here."
"6122","Jerry Ordway: kept alive the trademark and characters of Shazam for a generation. Thanks! <U+26A1>"
"6123","SHAZAM! is an absolute blast. A force of fun and is up there with Die Hard and Gremlins as one of my favorite Christmas movies. I can see why my brother loves the character so much. Also, Santa Clause is hilarious as a pussy who dgaf if the kids are watching on live TV."

"6127","@puckhogg4 You’ll like Shazam! I liked Captain Marvel, but it’s not in my MCU Top 10. It also seemed to do a bit of retconning involving a pretty major artifact in the MCU!"
"6128","#Shazam is going to get mixed comments but I think #DC took risk and they paid off."
"6129","This movie is great. It’s funny, has a great story, and the action is fun to watch. The overall tone in this movie is great, and I’m happy to see all of the diverse tones in the DCEU. #Shazam"
"6130","accidentally reserved a seat for shazam today"
"6131","@valleygrim @_joshpray Shazam is one of them and joker about forth with a ton of awards behind it"
"6132","and by pretty good i mean very good"
"6133","Whew today was eventful. Ortho appointment, a little grocery shopping, watched Shazam, nabbed a game involving a green dinosaur, made a new friend with the store clerk and got the fam dinner 

Time to study.. <U+0001F605> 

Hope everyone's Saturday is going great so far!"

"6138","@JackRicofficial @Mikeonscreen Thx again, fellas! #ShazamMovie chatter was fun. 

I dug this flick, too. It’s hip, playful, fun, colorful (literally in every way), jovial &amp; captures everything a teenager would be thinking, feeling &amp; doing if s/he suddenly obtain superpowers."
"6139","You know what would be cool? 

A Shazam challenge. 

But Shazam would’ve have to come out like 10 years ago. 

Take a picture as a kid, then when you grow up, put the #Shazam. And it’s a comparison of you as a kid and you grown up."
"6140","Trying to watch Shazam today"
"6141","@TheDCUniverse

Just saw #Shazam

Was worried it might be ""too young"" but did a great playing it for young &amp; old

Better than I expected

Great fun

Wanna see #BlackAdam in sequel!

Just wondering how much did Disney pay DC to no use ""Capt Marvel"" moniker at all anymore?"
"6142","Okay! Today @JarrettMelendez and I saw #Shazam! I still remember being at the #JusticeLeague premiere with @TiffanysTweets and her introducing me to @ZacharyLevi, he had the perfect Batson energy then and overdelivered now that I've seen it on the screen! Great work, everyone!"
"6143","But after seeing Shazam I do want to say that I really genuinely want to love it because there’s a ton of things the film did just great...

It’s just that I have my fair share of issues with it that kinda bog it down for me that prevent me from absolutely loving it."
"6144","Something about Shazam I also didn’t like was that it pushed the shared universe aspect of the DCEU quite a bit, unlike Wonder Woman where the push was somewhat subtle.

I just want these films to be their own thing and not have them be interconnected in this unnecessary universe"
"6145","Also was Shazam’s sequel-bait ending really warranted?

I dunno guys that felt kinda out of place and I didn’t really know what to think about it."
"6146","Shazam!:
I am quite glad that DC kept going in the same direction as they did with Aquaman. This is a fun, light-hearted, and colourful movie, perfectly adept at providing one with a good time.
E."
"6147","Spoiler-less #Shazam Spoilers

Of course David Sandberg voiced THAT character at the end!"
"6148","Their super power would be the ability to exist! Then i could answer this question. #Shazam"
"6149","probably the second best in this universe after 'Wonder Woman.' I can definitely recommend 'Shazam.'"
"6150","I find it funny how DC release a fun, bonkers, goofy, heartfelt film like 'Shazam' so soon after Zack Snyder tells people to ""wake the fuck up"" about his version of Batman killing people! But in all seriousness Shazam was easily the most fun the DCEU has been so far and is"
"6151","Went to go see @ShazamMovie this morning and enjoyed the film but really liked the @benwallfisch score.   It had the high spirit of adventure and magic this type of film needs. Looking forward to picking up a copy soon."
"6152","Every time I think I'm tired of superhero movies, along comes another great one #shazam"
"6153","my dad says that we can't go see shazam tomorrow so i'm seeking applications for a new dad"

"6155","anyone want to go see shazam tonight? bc im going and you can tag along"

"6157","@mrRuimy welcome to all things film and streaming with the semi-talented @NeilRosenApples the very capable Bill Bregoli and me, former big shot. Have a listen to the below podcast and please complain bitterly but also reTweet. Thanks."
"6158","Go see Shazam.

Easily one of the best DC movies.
It's got comedy.
It's got fights.
It's got heart."

"6160","Welp, thanks to traffic, guess Im seeing Shazam instead. Oh well"
"6161","This is so accurate. I love it. Please go see #Shazam"
"6162","@ZacharyLevi just saw Shazam. Awesome! Hilarious! Hope there’s more to come. <U+0001F600>"
"6163","So far, I head many people saying then Shazam is good. I means, the concept of a kid who turn into a super hero is really interesting. Plus, I do think then the fact they take a more lighthearted approach for it is genius. Might worth to see."
"6164","@jstoa23 @getFANDOM @Variety The budget for Shazam was 85 million. So compared to the 200 million dollar budget films. Shazam is doing objectively well"
"6165","I keep seeing  people freaking out over how silly the Shazam! movie looks and how weird it is to have another Captain Marvel the same year as uh, Captain Marvel BUT! Have you considered that Billy Batson is great?"

"6168","We just saw @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi We freaking loved it! The end fight scenes &amp; the last scene were my favorite. Great storyline too! Well done guys!"
"6169","#Shazam has the IT factor for me, joining Wonder Woman when it comes to exclusively the DCEU. Forget the fact that it's perceived as a superhero movie...it's just a damn good movie. Keep this momentum going DC!"

"6176","@airplane42 @FrHarrison @SonnyBunch It’s also what makes Shazam/Captain Marvel so interesting- they said imagine if a kid gets all this power."
"6177","@ponysmasher @henrygayden @DarrenLemke @geoffjohns I noticed “Shazam!” mentioned the 7 realms, which debuted in comics only a few months ago. Is this an example of the comics running with something created for a movie, or was the movie designed to coincide with this storyline?"
"6178","Radio stations use the value of the Shazam count to determine the popularity of a song . Radio play is a requirement for Billboard Hot 100

"6181","Billy Baston story is heartbreaking, orphan at a young age, finds his mother and it's just freaking heartbreaking to see that scene play out. This film gave comedy, drama, action in all the right spots. It's good to see DC n WB keeping what's make different than Disney #Shazam"

"6183","Shazam is the only DC movie that doesn’t make me want to slit my wrists"
"6184","@Josh2Gud4U ... and to think about how WB addressed Justice League by making it ""happy"" because it was too scary.  While watching Shazam,  I thought to myself: C'mon WB."
"6185","@asgardian200789 Oh yeah. But I saw that as more of Freddie's imagination than what actually happened. I think they'll want to actually show us Shazam joining the league instead of saying he's already a member"
"6186","@Boogie2988 At least #Shazam can punch a concrete wall, when I can't .. cause #johnucuntdothat"
"6187","I liked it. Great performances from both Zachary Levi and Asher Angel as the character. Mark Strong's Dr. Sivana=Best DCEU villain so far. Pretty heartwarming story. Definitely what we needed in this genre."
"6188","I hope to god Shazam is a good movie they already fucked up one of my other favorite super hero’s"
"6189","@flavioeldritch @ShazamMovie Snyder is save facing there is no synder cut. He know he messed up DCCU and the backlash has him lying to the public. Why would WB release an unfinished movie as he claims,then go back and do CGI,3 yrs later? He screwed up, he knows this. now hes tryin to stay relavant."

"6210","Got tix to Shazam tonight.  Looks like DC has really turned a corner movie-wise."
"6211","@zinyoulater I loved it! The whole comic book series plays off the fact that billy is a kid and so Shazam acts like a kid. All superhero movies tend to spend the first movie in the franchise based on the character learning about themselves. I thought the casting was great too."
"6212","I wonder if they just made a movie called P aneer M utter to cover up that the Democracy shit actually happened"
"6213","#Shazam was great! It's really a movie that anyone can enjoy. My audience was having a good time. And the humor is good humor because it's GENUINE and not forced. Also, I love my family."

"6215","@maizono22 @NintenZ captain marvel is definitely not the best mcu film (tho i liked it a lot) but i think the reason he compared them is because they both came out pretty recently

"6224","@a_m_patrick Surely hope so coz with Aquaman and Shazam, looks like the DCEU as it is known is gone"
"6225","So are we all going to act like #Shazam isn't a very good movie?

Anyways, #Aquaman was point one, #Shazam has let the cat out of the bag

DC far better equipped to win at any battle

Anyways, go watch it. Great family movie with loads of laughs"

"6232","@LordOfCheddar Gimme the run time of Shazam to join because I'm just about to watch it"
"6233","ok, no. I do like Wonder Woman more than Shazam,but not by much. Shazam is lighthearted, fun, funny, has tragedy aspects to it and it is very entertaining. You should definitely go see it #Shazam"
"6234","It’s kind of shocking Josh Schwartz has nothing to do with SHAZAM!"
"6235","Just got out of Shazam. It's a pretty fun movie. There's one scene near the end that I'm honestly surprised wasn't spoiled by any trailers. It was an amazing moment.

Keep it up DC/WB. You guys might be able to turn this whole super hero movie thing around."
"6236","Thanks to Shazam I learned that Kiss From A Rose is Seal’s song"

"6239","Omgosh, I loved Shazam! But then, I've always been a sucker for kids being the hero movies. This one goes effortlessly from really dark, to silly to heartfelt. &lt;3"
"6240","Shazam was a really fun time. While I got a little antsy in the middle, the climax is just tons of fun. There were scenes throughout that had my entire theater dying of laughter. And the family in this movie is really great."
"6241","@DCComics  has finally realised that @Marvel type movies actually make more money.  Loved #Shazam <U+0001F929>"
"6242","so we just asked for shazam and captain marvel posters at the cinema and WE GOT THEM AND THEYRE HUGE"
"6243","@fincherism Well, Shazam has diverse personalities on each characters. That's, for me, more important than skin colours."
"6244","My favorite scene of Shazam is when he has sex with an adult woman and then tries to Dutch Oven her."
"6245","Some of y’all bout to be real mad at me..."
"6246","Cannot stop hearing and seeing @daxshepard  when I see @ZacharyLevi in @ShazamMovie  - why is that, are they related or something or is it just the physical comedy style?

A grand official welcome to the DCEU to Billy Batson!"
"6249","@IsidoresDragon @Nash076 I put it above WW because the movie was only good until that horrible ending. Such wasted potential. At least Shazam was consistently good throughout the entire thing."

"6264","@Saints_Jimmy @AndyWarth Cause he was possessed &amp; exploited by evil ie the Seven Deadly Sins to destroy the wizard’s champion. Sivana was possessed by evil. Shazam was the one that stood in the way of them destroying the world."
"6265","@Saints_Jimmy @AndyWarth He was not affimed as a child &amp; rejected &amp; was blamed for a family accident. That is enough to become self consumed &amp; a villian. He grew up in an emotionally unhealthy &amp; unsupportive home obsessed with being accepted by his family &amp; the wizard Shazam."
"6266","the fun parts of SHAZAM were very fun but the boring parts were SO LONG AND BORING"
"6267","After my boy’s tough week I took him to the movies to get out of the house to see Shazam. It’s a movie about a kid that yells Shazam and gets struck by lightning and gets superpowers. 20 minutes in I was yelling Shazam hoping lighting would hit me to put me out of my misery."
"6268","im going to watch shazam again tomorrow!"
"6269","@willcblogs @ShazamMovie Update : what the hell is loyalty any moreeeee"

"6274","@deadmansland12 @ShazamMovie His a kid. What else would a kid do if they suddenly grew into a superhero?"
"6275","@GraceRandolph I just saw it. Love the kids and the whole foster story  but Shazam himself feels dumb down. Apart from having some good laughs i was un impressed. I saw people walk out in the middle of the movie. I’m not hatting on DC. Love DC. Shazam/ Superman Animated movie was better <U+0001F641>"

"6287","During the whole #Shazam movie I was waiting for a clash sequence @noobde"
"6288","I'm decently more hyped for Shazam than Avengers tbh even if I'd bet on the latter being much better"

Yes, the best DC film and past the cursed Snyderverse.
Could have been like 10 minutes shorter or felt 10 minutes too long. This movie EMBRACED The Big Cheese and should. <U+0001F600><U+0001F44D>"
"6301","@NintenZ @septembermach I mean I don't think that's weird. It's been a thing in shows sometimes where they make figures and stuff of the superheroes in that universe. I wouldn't be weirded out if a kid was playing with a Batman figurine in a Shazam movie. They're just references and nothing more."
"6302","@ChainsawReacts we got so much awesome stuff coming this year! Captain Marvel and Shazam were both really good! Endgame will be one of the best movies ever made period I think and we still have the Arrowverse shows to enjoy and we have Crisis on Infinite Earths and Star Wars IX!"
"6303","@KaiserNeko saw Shazam. Easly the best credits since Deadpool."
"6304","@JerryOrdway This is the first Shazam comic I ever read. I bought it because of the cover. Back in the days when saving lunch money was my only way to fund comics."
"6305","@JMDeMatteis This episode was interesting because Billy (Shazam) is still learning about the real world.  How he wants to believe that Lex Luthor has turned a new leaf and wants to be president.  Superman's not buying that (figures).  It's a true clash of two heroes and a great episode!!"
"6306","@WarnerBrosUK My kids love it,  a great movie,  IT was awesome #Shazam Is Fabulous"

"6311","#Shazam  is Fresh , Fun and heart. 4/5"
"6312","@DanForinton @YahooEnt Watch Shazam. The main character is in a foster home with a hispanic mother and samoan dad with diverse kids. All of which becomes an integral part in the movie."
"6313","@thejrocktv Shazam! is better than 75% of the MCU movies. Once you’re that high up, everything else is subjective."
"6314","Shazam! had characters of different races, ethnicities, specialities and had a character who had a physical disability. It 100% is the most diverse. &amp; on top of that, nothing felt forced or like someone was trying to pander. It was all ORGANIC."
"6315","Shazam! was better than 75% of the MCU movies. I’m ready to scrap over it."
"6316","Just came back from watching SHAZAM!, actually so damn good, I loved it. DC are doing really well with their movies lately"
"6317","So I went to see #shazam because jack d.grazer played in it .I went there with one of my friends and we thought we were alone,until 4 girls,In groups of 2 came in.I screamed ""ARE YOU GUYS-"" ""Here for Jack?"" One of them completed.we were like YEAAHH  we sat close to them and we"
"6318","Light-hearted movie enjoyable. Kinda like the guardians of the galaxy of the DC universe. #Shazam"
"6319","Alright Tweeps, I need reviews on both Shazam and Pet Sematary."
"6320","These same bullies pulled up to school in a truck and parked right in front on the sidewalk/grass, hopped out and just walked in ready to start the day. I wish I were 6, maybe I wouldve enjoyed it more. #Shazam"
"6321","I don't know what yall smoking but anybody saying #Shazam is the best DC superhero movie ever is either lying, easily entertained, or hoping somebody at DC sees their tweet and invites them to some events."
"6322","It also reminded me of IT, where none of the adults seemed to matter at all. There's a scene where the two bullies mercilessly jumped a handicapped kid in front of the school and nobody did shit. #Shazam"
"6323","IDK how DC did it, but they managed to stretch out the 3-4 trailers/clips released prior to the movie into the first hour and 30 mins of the movie cause I felt like I saw nothing new at all. #Shazam"
"6324","Very happy for @ZacharyLevi and the success of #Shazam. Like other fans I’ve been a huge fan since the @nbcchuck years. #chuck @ChuckVStheMovie"
"6325","@PNemiroff The scene where Shazam gives a scared girl a stuffed tiger and tells her it’ll be ok. It’s a small moment but it’s effective."
"6326","I have to disagree completely."
"6327","Just got back from Shazam. By far this has been my favorite DC Movie.
Congratulations to @ZacharyLevi and all the crew for this amazing experience"

"6342","My review of Shazam: I really liked it
The hero, Shazam, was annoying because you see him do things and think ""This isn't how heroes are"" but that's the point, he's no hero, he's a kid 
It was pretty funny and also had a good message about family"
"6343","@isBLAKIE Good tune couldn’t Shazam it of YouTube had to pause it at the end &amp; look you up on iTunes"

Please, make more movies like this one."

"6406","@GraceRandolph Just saw #Shazam. Such a great  movie. <U+0001F929> You were right, it was totally under-sold in the trailers. Now heading home to watch your spoiler-filled coverrage."
"6407","@UkiyaSeed @JerryOrdway @comiXology Me, too. I bought the digitals on Comixology, but I still want a deluxe collected edition for my shelf.

I have to say @DCComics is not doing a great job for making Shazam comics available either digitally or printed. I expected to find Golden and Silver Age classic collections."
"6408","I'm hearing Shazam is totally living up to the hype from the previews. Nothing wrong with having TWO comic book franchises churn out awesome movies."

"6412","@arris_quinones Loved the ending of #shazam"
"6413","#Shazam was really good! I know this movie took a lot of elements from the more recent Geoff Johns run but there were some Fawcett comics easter eggs in there as well."
"6414","@ZacharyLevi loved yoi as #Shazam!!! Mind blowing!!! Like it was such a joyride! It had everything ranging from comedy to action to emotions anfd what not! Nobody could have done a better job than you Sir! Love you love you love you... going to watch it a second time next week."

"6424","Just saw #Shazam LOVED IT!! I can imagine every kid in the world shouting “SHAZAM!!” and waiting for that power to happen. Just like in the 90’s when we all tried to move shit with our eyes thanks to Matilda."
"6425","PEOPLE WITH OCCULAR MIGRAINE LISTEN UP.

If you want to go see Shazam then you need to be prepared!
The bright flashing imgs from mltpl lightening bolts can trigger the attack.

Ive been down for almst 12hours with a extreme migraine cause of the movie.

Please RT to save a life!"
"6426","I loved Shazam! It was the kind of superhero story I love: lots of character building, personal stakes, and world stakes. So good!"

     Vacation styled story where the Vasquez family end up stumbling across Kahndaq, while in that part of the world, and Black Adam’s sinister plot.

"6434","Both main characters literally have the same name"
"6435","Shazam was good. Felt like a superhero movie that would have came out 15 years ago though. Would like to see a sequel."

Nothing major, but it's the little details in it that annoy the hell out of  me, I'm just fed up with whoever runs the show and keeps doing this stuff.

"6439","@_VintageReality He’s literally a kid who becomes a superhero, like seriously what do people want? Shazam would be the same time of Batman or even Wonder Woman. Maybe when Black Adam comes along it’ll be a little darker (it kind of should be anyway) but other then that no haha"
"6440","Just finished watching it. That qween was the absolute truth. The question. The answer. The everything"
"6441","Is shazam actually good?"
"6442","My kid and I just came back from watching @ShazamMovie and what a blast! @ZacharyLevi and the rest of the cast knocked it out of the park! Top tier fun.  Highly recommend!! #shazam #ShazamFamily #dccomics"

"6444","Do yourself a favor and go watch SHAZAM. The ending is really damn good."
"6445","I have to point out that @ZacharyLevi's performance as well as the performance of the other cast members was phenomenal! It is so good to see @ZacharyLevi on the big screen again! You've earned this man, I am so happy for you! #shazam"
"6446","hey everyone, here to tell you @ShazamMovie was soooo güd and made my heart warm"
"6447","Omg the @ShazamMovie was amazing. 5/5. Definitely going to see it again. My kids loved it! Their favorite super hero movie to date."
"6448","@CohhCarnage Shazam just came out. Maybe you can watch that? :O"
"6449","@BenRivers23 @YahooEnt Yes, suicide squad has more Caucasian people than Shazam, but it still has other ethnicities represented. Take a seat and stfu"
"6450","@DavidAFrench I hated it. This is the biggest difference between my review &amp; critics review since Hail Caesar. If u view Shazam as little kids movie, I get it. For adults though, too hokey &amp; childish. When multiple heroes were on screen I thought I was looking at the Power Rangers. Not for me"
"6451","@ZacharyLevi absolutely loved Shazam! You and the rest of the cast/crew made an amazing film!"
"6452","It’s worth it"
"6453","*yells Shazam gets struck by lightning and fucking dies"
"6454","So my review on #Shazam 
Wasnt as good as I thought it'd be.  One of those movies where all the good parts are in previews. The bad guy wasn't compelling neither were the heroes. This wont be a franchise."
"6455","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Already buy a ticket. I can't wait to see again. A great movie. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> I would like to see a sequel to the movie about the character, who appeared in a cameo role in the film."
"6456","Give this man the recognition he deserves!!!!!!

Watch Shazam in theaters everywhere! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"6457","@ZacharyLevi just caught Shazam. Solid work. I got a strong feeling that you had fun with the role. Looking forward to Shazam 2 almost as much as I look forward to more Chuck should we ever be so blessed."
"6458","shazam shazam shazam the only dc character that matters"
"6459","If you gonna see Shazam, stay till the end end really enf bc there’s two post scene credits"

(Zac really was divine)"

"6462","@ShazamMovie was awesome <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FE> finally a great DC movie on the other hand @captainmarvel was awful hopefully @Avengers end game will be great!"

"6464","@THR Well to be fair, shazam was once called captain marvel at one point before marvel got all bitchy and attempted to sue. Difference is shazam never got turned into a sjw campaign"
"6465","That’s kinda what I like about what the DCEU is starting to do, especially with films like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam!, and especially Joker. DC’s definitely getting a better idea as to what to do with their universe than they were two years ago."
"6466","Now I'm going to see Shazam! which I'm very curious about"
"6467","Yeah so Shazam! is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight but the Godzilla trailer beforehand will be the only thing on my mind for about 5 weeks"
"6468","It shouldn’t be a competition because it was an “Important movie” but yes SHAZAM! is more diverse than Black Panther. 

All you have to do is look at the Shazam Family lol the people bitching clearly haven’t watched the film and are just mad for whatever reason"
"6469","It's pretty shocking how different Shazam is from every other DC movie, barring Aquaman, the DCEU looks way better without Snyder"
"6470","im going to see shazam soon <U+0001F973>"
"6471","@arris_quinones Little bit a of a disappointment, found several plot holes in the movie, like how they portrayed Shazam for the most part. Really good actor, good villain. Not a big fan of the ending. Never was a big fan of The Marvel Family/Shazam Family."
"6472","This is why I am on Twitter 
The enter-net should fun 
This guy is funny as hell"

Props to @ZacharyLevi and Mark Strong and the foster family.

"6482","@DavidAFrench I'm looking forward to seeing this becuase I loved the TV show called ""Chuck"", with  Zachary Levi as the nerd-spy Chuck,  it was just what you described Shazam to be.. funny, fun  and heart. LOTS and LOTS of heart. He's a very good actor. #shazam"

@ZacharyLevi 
#ShazamMovie"
"6487","Saw #ShazamMovie last night. Had to try really not to scream #Shazam when one scene from the trailer hit. Plenty of laughs, plenty of heart, &amp; Darla was EVERYTHING!"
"6488","@Jimski @ShazamMovie Thanks for the warning. I was actually considering taking Ted Bob to see it."
"6489","Shazam was good for the first half but the second half just felt too corny and made me roll me eyes throughout."
"6490","The whole family loved @ShazamMovie it was so awesome!! @ZacharyLevi was perfect!"
"6491","@ShazamMovie I like dc characters better, but this movie sucked ass through a straw. That stupid muscle suit he wears is horrible. The acting is B level crap, the script sucked. Really nothing good about the movie."
"6492","This isn't a great surprise, as it was no secret this movie was based on the New 52 Shazam comic (a comic that was the worst thing to happen to Captain Marvel). In fact, it's *almost* a straight adaptation of the 2011 comic. Thankfully, the movie does the comic better."
"6493","But divorcing it from Captain Marvel, SHAZAM! was great super hero movie, and far superior to the source material it's derived from. I truly hope people, even CM fans, see it and enjoy it."
"6494","yo Shazam! is a fun and amazing movie and I'd recommend you go watch it asap"
"6495","I saw it in IMAX. (I tend to do that with superhero films) I'd say check it out on a matinee...normal theater. Should be just as good without extra cost. <U+0001F913><U+0001F44D>"
"6496","So Shazam....

Without spoiling it...it's a DEFINITE yes.

Santa stole the show, though.
And Darla is my fave."
"6497","@VontesRealm If I remember correctly, it all boiled down to the trademark.
Fawcett Comics (who DC purchased all rights from) let it lapse. The copyright is still theirs for everything else.
I'm bothered by that so much. Shazam is just a silly name compared to Captain Marvel."
"6498","This is disgusting @ironsofjoy @ComixDivision @YellowFlashGuy @NECRO_XIII"
"6499","@davedauthor @ShazamMovie @DCComics @wbpictures @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @Handlebrody But they briefly saved all of the space horses, Dave. *They briefly saved all of the space horses*.

"6500","@ZacharyLevi just saw Shazam! Congratulations on a great film."
"6501","Nice. #SHAZAM looking at $50 million+ opening weekend U.S., that's a big number for a character with near-zero prior recognition as far as modern pop-culture is concerned (and it only cost about $80 mil to make)"
"6502","They got Shazam near perfect in this film. Well worth the watch"
"6503","Shazam is really good and @ZacharyLevi is incredible in it (as always). I would 100% recommend seeing it."

"6508","@ZacharyLevi I just watched #shazam and i couldnt be more grateful for the experience. The script, the fights, YOU, JACK, ASHER, all the family members, you did it! you touched my heart and made me so proud of being a dcfan. YOU WAS BORN TO BE SHAZAM! thank you for this, zach <U+0001F495>"

"6515","Saw #Shazam was good. I had two problems with it, but I forgot one of them by the time I got home from the theatre. So it must’ve not been that important. 
“Bullet immunity” is a dumb line. I would’ve preferred “bullet proof”"
"6516","Official irveymasten Review

I saw #Shazam. It is absolutely wonderful. It emits so much palpable joy. I was not expecting such a genuine emotional reaction to a comic book movie based on a character I had literally zero attachment to. It’s a special film.
9/10 GREAT!!! <U+0001F192><U+0001F192><U+0001F192>"
"6517","The PG-13 aspects of Shazam (particularly some of the demon rampages) were a bummer for what should be a very kid-friendly hero. Levi was really good. I just wish the whole movie followed the tone his performance set."
"6518","Saw Shazam! today. Really fun movie.

John Glover will forever be the dad of bald super villains."
"6519","Truth @ZacharyLevi was the perfect actor for this role, he knocked it out of the park. Beating my already high expectations! Go see @ShazamMovie, you’ll thank me later<U+0001F3C6>!"
"6520","Ok,  Shazam shits all over the other DC movies which isn't hard tbh."
"6521","Saw Shazam last night and it was delightful.  It's just a fun time and that was everything I wanted"
"6522","Going to see Shazam tonight, see you on cam after <U+0001F618>"
"6523","@JerryOrdway @ShazamMovie Tbh I wish they were color coordinated like they were in your graphic novel because it was hard at times to figure out which sin was which after they left their confinement."
"6524","Asher Angel is so precious, he’s my son now"
"6525","@bassettstyrus I was waiting to see that moment ofc shazam fam, but when he jumps it what give me chills"
"6526","when he jumps from the building in the air and the light strike is THAT moment"
"6527","@GeoffThorne Shazam. Always Shazam. Oh, the wonders I could show you ..."
"6528","Shazam was fun. Nothing amazing. I guess that’s the point, to have fun with these damn movies."
"6529","@arkaynine_ @nmacias24 @BrandonDavisBD Never been a fan of dc movies. They’re just not my thing. I don’t plan on spending my money or time seeing Shazam. If you like it, that’s cool, I’m just not really interested in it"
"6530","payless shoe source may be closing but at least it got that #Shazam promo"
"6531","never thought I'd see meagan good be in a superhero movie <U+0001F602> she bad in that suit tho <U+0001F60D> #Shazam"
"6532","How come no one is talking about Shazam?"
"6533","@dxferris Oh the cartoon version. I grew up on the real people shows. Was like Godzilla.  ULTRAMAN and Shazam were my first.  Unless it was the black and white Superman shows."
"6534","Shazam was a fun movie to watch my one problem was the kid and the super hero Billy doesn't act the same way his super hero self does. I recommend checking it out"
"6535","@iPhotoGuy Maaaaaaaaaannnn! I liked that Dr. Sirvana provided a terrifying counterbalance to the fun provided by Shazam. Sirvana was taking care of business, brother! <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"

Touched every possible emotion. I for sure will see it at least 3 more times. Thanks"
"6540","mark strong in shazam was low-key my highlight?! i didn’t expect that. but well, dc never disappoints when it comes to villains."

"6543","Saw #Shazam again today. The place filled with families <U+0001F642>"
"6544","@lornehanks I mean, there’s nothing wrong with having both! I just don’t see the attraction of making Shazam more Batman V Superman and less Teen Titans Go. Loved TTGTTM, and Doom Patrol just hit Crave and I’m looking forward to it."
"6545","I guess I’m hitting the movies solo tonight... pet sematary? Shazam?"
"6546","Shazam! was actually so good I was not expecting it, is DC finally getting it on???"

"6551","It was good. Really good <U+2764><U+FE0F> @ZacharyLevi #SoMuchLove #ShazamMovie"
"6552","Me and @MallieTheSheep saw Shazam today. Was pretty good! Well, the first three minuets of visual and then the 15 of darkness and only sound before we got a refund was good. 10/10"
"6553","Finally get the chance to see #Shazam tonight. So excited."
"6554","The movie Shazam was awesome. It helps me getting inspired for my big projects and all that stuff. :D"
"6555","Enjoyed Shazam! and especially liked his superpower to tell you the name of any song he hears."
"6556","@hyperheroes It had some flaws but it was an amazing comedy. Zachary Levi was the perfect man for the role. It didn’t take itself seriously and that’s why it was so good. I think this is my favorite DC movie now. I’ll probably see it again. Shazam was a 7/10 for me."
"6557","@DROFLIMDUDE1 @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher Seeing it tomorrow"
"6558","Saw Shazam with the boy. I liked it, not oscar worthy and not a tearjerker but a decent one. 7/10"
"6559","I have seen #Shazam three times already, it's THAT entertaining! @ZacharyLevi is electrifying ! Also love seeing Annabelle in the pawn shop! @ponysmasher #WB #DCConjuringUniverseCrossover?!?"
"6560","Sorry. In regard to SHAZAM! IMAX showing."
"6561","we're going to rewatch infinity war sometime this week (i'm on spring break)

and i might ask to watch shazam
i'm not into DC but it looks good and people seem to like it"
"6562","Shazam was actually super fun, way better than the whatever the shit Aquaman was, I almost dropped DC for good that day"
"6563","#SHAZAM gets a lot of things right, but the tone for the villains is NOT one. Geez, @DCComics - what is so hard about this?"
"6564","Don't drink anything before you go see @ZacharyLevi in #Shazam. There is no good place to sneak out and go to the bathroom. None. 
We had the best time, though I may have damaged my husband's hand. :-)"
"6565","Oh man #Shazam what a lovely movie! I'm sure I'll have more thoughts on it soon but what a good family flick!

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks @ponysmasher Not only was that movie a wonderful shout out to adopted kids, it's awesome to see some DIY filmmakers make it BIG."
"6566","Ok #Shazam was just really an amazing brilliant movie!! Best DC movie in recent years, it was just a lot of fun. @ZacharyLevi is just brilliant as Shazam, can’t wait for the sequel to see him continue this brilliant performance. And @AsherAngel was great as Billy too. Great movie"
"6567","Shazam only works if Billy's a kid because kids are the only nice people in PA"
"6568","Tried to go see the new Shazam movie, only to have the camera die 5 minutes in and be told we can wait another hour or get a refund <U+0001F644>"
"6569","Shazam was so wholesome, it was like the perfect super hero movie for 12-14 year olds everywhere in the best possible way

Definitely up there with Wonder Woman in terms of DC movies"
"6570","SHAZAM probably won't set the world on fire at the box office, which is a shame."
"6571","People! Go out and see #ShazamMovie . I saw it two weeks ago at a early screening and it was great! Support this movie"
"6572","Not sure if I wanna go see Shazam tonight or stay home and play Overwatch til the new DBS comes on."
"6573","@BlackMajikMan90 As studios have a massive stake in homevideo, sometimes they make more profit in home video than during the theatrical run. So, if Shazam has a homevideo as strong as WonderWoman, it could make on theatres 100M US, 150M overseas and anything after this would be profit already"
"6574","They sleep on Shazam when they def shouldn’t be. It’s one of the best superhero movies imo."
"6575","I enjoyed more Shazam than Aquaman more cause using less of the special effects,Aquaman was so constant.
I also thought the cast was pretty great overall....Just Zach didn't really click with me."
"6576","#SHAZAM was a ton of fun! @ZacharyLevi was PERFECT and the movie hit just the right tone. There were two things I really wanted to see and the movie gave me both of them. Count this one as a win"
"6577","@BittrScrptReadr @ZacharyLevi I knew he'd be perfect for it because of his time on Chuck. That's basically an extension of the same role. Loved that show.

Really enjoyed #Shazam and I'm not a huge super hero movie fan."
"6578","Shazam is fun, but despite what the comedic marketing showed, it has some scary stuff and really earned its PG13."
"6579","Lmfao w yo 5 followers. And IM lookin for clout <U+0001F602> you’re reachin for attention <U+0001F602>"

"6585","Go see #Shazam it is fantastic and @ZacharyLevi is his usual charming self."
"6586","I want to see Shazam bad but no one else wants to :("
"6587","@RafaelCasal @ValerieComplex Shazam/CM/CT is sometimes chubby In the comics, wouldn’t mind if they went that rout"
"6588","Listen, I absolutely teared up seeing the #AvengersEndgame trailer in the big screen, and then #Shazam got me, too."
"6589","They absolutely nailed #Shazam, up to and including the third act."

"6593","Just got out of #ShazamMovie and while flawed at times it was a ton of fun, full video review tonight"
"6594","Watched Shazam! today and have to thank you @ponysmasher for this beauty of a film...

Straight away one of my favorite movies of all time.

Thank you so much!"
"6595","#Shazam was so good!  This is one of the best DC movies so far.  My favorite part may have just been all the family scenes.  You can’t help but love them."
"6596","#Shazam was fantastic! such heart and humor, I adored it. @ZacharyLevi and those wonderful kids really made something special. I cannot wait to meet Zachary in a couple weeks at the Calgary Expo!"
"6597","Can’t wait to spend the next three decades arguing whether or not Shazam! is a Christmas movie."
"6598","Goddamn I didn’t know I could admire .@RafaelCasal more than I already do."
"6599","Seeing Shazam at like 9 in the morning tomorrow literally THIS is the LIFE"
"6600","@ShazamMovie Saw this in IMAX today. The ""discovering superpowers"" part of the movie was the best part. 

Overall very entertaining"
"6601","Shazam was okay. Some of the characters were annoying while others were adorable. It was an okay movie."
"6602","Whoever was in charge of casting the superhero Freddy in Shazam DID THAT <U+0001F5E3> not spoiling but they literally read my mind <U+0001F606>"
"6603","Truth be told, I dunno what I liked better.

The #MLPSeason9 premier.

Or

#Shazam"
"6604","I knew it...DCEU movie must get comma."
"6605","Watching #Shazam was like coming back to a time when cbm were not about recycled formulas with the sole purpose of being quick entertainment and making money, Shazam made me laugh a lot without appealing to forced and cheap humor, I wish we could have a #SpiderMan movie like this"
"6606","@tracymacrazy @SethGreen @ZacharyLevi @RobertDowneyJr There was a girl about 7 or 8 behind me that literally CACKLED the entire movie. She was almost as entertaining as @ZacharyLevi was in the movie. Shazam appeals to EVERYONE."
"6607","I'm going to say Shazam The Movie is a Piece of Garbage to me and I'm not putting up with that and I'm not going to Pay my money to see it in Jamaica Ave and Shazam is not really revanlet as a Super Hero and he's really not better than Superman and Batman."
"6608","Just saw #SHAZAM and it was awesome it was a really great movie I definitely recommend seeing it <U+0001F603>"
"6609","Funko is spoiling a big part of #Shazam. If you haven’t seen the movie yet, stay off Twitter and mute all the Shazam related hashtags."
"6610","Wow Shazam is a blast, glad to see we haven’t forgotten how to make Superman work in modern DC movies"
"6611","And right on cue we have the Shazam Woke Twitter controversy that pisses and moans about a headline instead of celebrating what the film actually did for superhero diversity. Thanks Yahoo."
"6612","“Sounds like a lot of fun and also sometimes suddenly horrifying.” #SuperEqsyBarelyAnInconvenience #PitchMeeting #Shazam"
"6613","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures I regret not taking a picture next to the cardboard model thingy shazam"
"6614","Saw Shazam and that shit was more fun that I expected shout to the young gawd billy bats with the Versace cape"
"6615","#Shazam is fun. excellent Mark Strong villainry. my only complaint is they used the Niall Horan single I like the least!!!"
"6616","About to grab seats and see #Shazam I am excited"
"6617","Shahungry! And good food appears in front of me in the blink of an eye <U+0001F32E>"
"6618","@DCComics @ShazamMovie I will  say my favorite part of this was seeing kids legit scared during that one scene."
"6619","@DCComics @ShazamMovie No one says that or believes that."
"6620","Definitely recommend going and watching Shazam! Especially if you want to have a good old laugh<U+0001F970><U+26A1><U+FE0F> @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi"
"6621","The poc got like 10 min of screen time total. Thats not diversity"
"6622","@NerdHubOfficial @ShazamMovie Good to know there are more reviewers out there that love sharing content. Do you guys have a link to your youtube channel? Or is it all on the blog?"
"6623","@LetsTalkDiana Awesome pics!!

Saw @ShazamMovie opening night. Have 3 words: #fantastic #family #fun 
So good. Also, #darladudley is the most adorable lil' pumpkin on the planet, and she deserves all the hugs <U+0001F49E>"
"6624","SHAZAM was pretty fun. Has those formulaic origin story issues, but overall a damn good time."
"6625","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Going to the movies today! Can’t wait, hopefully it will be a good movie."
"6626","Hey @ponysmasher congrats on making the most heartwarming , fun movie superhero movie ever . Shazam was so freakin good , thank you !!"
"6627","@ponysmasher @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel  just got home from seeing #ShazamMovie and it was so good. My son and I loved it, such a heartfelt funny and powerful film. You all and the rest of the cast and crew did such a great job. Hopefully there will be a sequel!"
"6628","If you wanna be with someone share that power. Share the love. Share the potential and confidence and direction you have with the ones you love. On some Shazam typa shit."
"6629","@ShazamMovie waiting to watch #shazam with my kids!"
"6630","Was there a The Mist Easter egg in #Shazam ?"
"6631","There are so many things. I <U+2764><U+FE0F> this movie, I smiled, I laughed, I cried, I had a visceral reaction when #Superman showed us (God I miss #henrycavill) #Shazam is the best @TheDCUniverse movie so far. 10/10!! It was so great! I feel like a kid reading her 1st #comicbook again!"
"6632","they have a samoan actor in the movie? omg"
"6633","just watched that Shazam movie and he didn’t name a single song. pretty disappointed."
"6634","Ugh why didn’t Shazam save you the songGgGgGg"
"6635","Yeah, so #Shazam isn’t great. I have no idea what I’ve just watched."
"6636","@ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie 
The family and I loved Shazam.  Thank you for helping to make this a great day."
"6637","#ShazamMovie shows us that a  talented and passionate cast (@ZacharyLevi) &amp; crew add more to any film than a massive budget. Better than the recent recent #Marvel solo outings, with some Superman love thrown in."
"6638","Watching Shazam and I've actually forgotten I'm watching a DC movie. Another hit after Aqua Man.. 10/10"
"6639","@i_am_niyi @AuntyAdah @Falilatt_ @itsTomiwa @Osastheking when are we going to watch #ShazamMovie"
"6640","I just love how diverse #Shazam was on the representation without making a fuss about it! There is literally a hero representative for almost everyone."
"6641","Just watched Shazam in a cinema I havent been to yet in Prague and oh my god it was cool.
Loved the movie and recommend it for people who love superhero movies with good humour.
9/10"
"6642","Saw Shazam, was good fun, a bit cheesy towards the end but it's still good. It's a bit like Deadpool in which its aware of all the other characters and makes fun of them while having its own fun in the same world. :)"
"6643","I am happy to say that #Shazam lived up to the fantastic word of mouth. It truly is a complete package, full of heart, laughs, action, &amp; scares. Whatever your thoughts are on the #DCEU run don’t walk to see this one. #HighlyRecommended."
"6644","*sits down in theater to watch shazam* 

*unbuttons pants* 

*opens Dr Pepper I snuck in* 

I’m ready"
"6645","@ZacharyLevi &amp; #TeamShazam Thank you SO much for a truly magical &amp; uniting experience. I wish you could have been in the theater to see &amp; feel the love &amp; how #SHAZAM brought a group of strangers together! <U+0001F33B><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"6646","Man it feels so good to be over the flu! First thing I see is #Shazam tomorrow night in IMAX! @ZacharyLevi"
"6647","#Shazam #ShazamMovie
Excellent movie all around 
Loved the shout outs to Batman Superman Aquaman
Superman cameo was unexpected but great non the less
DC is finally learning is the most important thing 
#ZacharyLevi will forever be immortalized as Shazam"
"6648","#Shazam #ShazamMovie showed you don't need a ridiculous huge budget and still have a fun entertaining movie that stays true to the story and the DC universe. <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>"

"6650","Uh, #Shazam is one of the most delightful movies I’ve ever seen. I could watch it again right now."
"6651","@Connor_Green Of course, this is a hilariously low bar.

(Though I have heard Shazam is superb and I can't wait to see it)"
"6652","@Connor_Green Aquaman is entertaining and definitely more of a fun tone than DC's other pre-Shazam movies, but it's not a great movie by any means."
"6653","#Shazam was as good as everyone said it was. The team did really well on this movie!"
"6654","@ZacharyLevi I've now gotten my co worker who loves superhero movies into shazam she told me to tell her how it is after I go see ot Tuesday. I told her it looks really great and funny."
"6655","Well that was an interesting ending to #SHAZAM"
"6656","I Just  watched #ShazamMovie ! It was really nice to see @ZacharyLevi  and @Handlebrody  together in action. Now can we expect a crossover with Chuck  and The O.C. ? @JoshSchwartz76  please help us with this mind blowing crossover reboot."
"6657","It’s definitely PG-13 level content. My point is that Shazam is a bad fit for a PG-13 rating. He’s fundamentally more innocent and sweeter than other superheroes. A more kid-friendly movie just seems the smarter approach here. Especially given Levi’s performance."
"6658","Sign me up. I'm in. #SaturdayMorning #SaturdayThoughts #SaturdayMotivation #TheChi #Showtime #Shazam #ShazamMovie #dccomics"
"6659","At the theater to see Shazam with the fam.  Got my oldest here too.  Woohoo"
"6660","I wasn’t a foster child, but I was adopted. There was a moment in #Shazam! that spoke to me more than I’d like to admit. I love superhero movies, but I felt more from that moment than I have from any comic movie. It was a bit long, but I loved it. Couldn’t recommend it more!"
"6661","@iNabberTV @Thafnine @_CoffeeClub This is an incorrect opinion. Shazam cannot be better than The Dark Knight. Literally impossible"
"6662","#Shazam IMAX: Funny super hero tale mixing ample amounts of humor, action and even dark scares. Solid origin story which is not entirely predictable. Shd satisfy comic book crowd for 3 weeks until the big one arrives."
"6663","PLEASE support this movie if you have any interest. It’s fantastic, I’d really go as far as saying it’s one of the best comic book movies I’ve seen."
"6664","omg time to be annoying again pls go watch shazam yall"
"6665","Just saw #Shazam really great movie <U+0001F642><U+0001F412><U+0001F44D>"
"6666","My only Shazam! complaint is there was like...a LOT of direct marvel rip offs and not like in a joking way like Deadpool like deadass direct copying"
"6667","All I care about in DC World is Wonder Woman and Shazam!"
"6668","“say my name!”
“BILLY!”
“no say the name i say to turn into this guy!” 
“SHAZAM”"
"6669","Shazam was fun. Big reminder that Marvel is not a monopoly on lightheartedness"
"6670","Just took the kids to see #Shazam and they loved it.  Great movie and as always @ZacharyLevi is fantastic.  Would highly recommend!"
"6671","@Mikesul33830663 @UngkarS @snyder_cut @ZainAqsa3 @ScottMendelson @Forbes I'm a massive Snyder fan and I'm a massive DC fan. I absolutely adored Shazam and Aquaman. I love Batman the Brave and the Bold. I love Batman 66. I loved Nolan's trilogy. I love Burton &amp; Schumacher's movies. I love the old Superman movies. I love the Supergirl movie."
"6672","Weekend thread! Have you watched #ShazamMovie ? Give me your spoiler free review and rating (1-5) in a tweet. #weekendvibes"
"6673","@Josh2Gud4U Horror directors will still need to flex some. I recall my first ventures into horror as a kid, I feel SHAZAM might be that for many kids out there!"
"6674","I still have to watch Antman &amp; The Wasp AND Captain Marvel before <U+0001F923>endgame. oops.
GOing to see Shazam tonight"
"6675","I don’t need to see Shazam in theaters because I already have the app installed on my iPhone XS. It’s easy - just open Shazam and it will tell you what song is playing"
"6676","Meeting scene=hospital scene, bus scene=train scene, Sins controlling Sivana=Tentacles controlling Octavius, getting distracted by money=quitting being Spider-Man. They are very similar films are both can be argued to be the best DC and Marvel films, respectively. <U+0001F914>"
"6677","@ShazamMovie So fucking good. Laughed my ass off. Cant believe its DC #Shazam"
"6678","Zachary Levi as Shazam: *breaks staff over his knee* 
Me, shouts: Oh can you do that but with my back!?!"

"6681","Round 2 of #Shazam"
"6682","Shazam was damn fun
I’d watch again, I’m super happy I enjoyed this one cause it looked fun and it was great so woo"
"6683","shazam - not as much of a comedy as the trailer suggests but still a solid film. some shoddy cgi and an overlong first act are my only minor gripes. bravo dc/wb <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>

<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"6684","#Shazam! Nails the three H’s of a comic book movie: Heart, Humor and Heroism. It’s a fun, coming-of-age film with a great message attached to it. Zachary Levi could lead the charge for the DCEU in place of Superman and I wouldn’t be mad. 

8.8/10 - would buy the VHS bundle."
"6685","Also, if @Emeril were a superhero, would his name be ShaBAM!?! 

#SHAZAM"
"6686","Quick service announcement:@ShazamMovie  was awesome. That is all, you may now return to your lives. <U+0001F609>"
"6687","Just saw Shazam! Was a really refreshing Superhero film!"
"6688","@ZacharyLevi we just said #shazam and UVA got a basket. Going with that for the rest of the game! #FinalFour<U+FE0F>"
"6689","The best part of @ShazamMovie is 100% seeing Seth Cohen reach his true destiny."
"6690","Discussion talk. Dad getting tips as a young waiter and movies like Shazam and Us. #Fridays #shazam"
"6691","yesterday my dad and i went to go see the movie Shazam and now he randomly yells “shazam” lmfaoo wtf <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"6692","Btw I saw Shazam yesterday and it was sooo wonderful and entertaining I haven't enjoyed a movie THAT much in a long time honestly"
"6693","There is a giggling toddler in the same theater as I am as we're watching Shazam.... I hope this doesn't completely ruin anything <U+0001F605><U+0001F602>"
"6694","As I expected (and predicted), #Shazam is beating box office estimates and looks likely to finish with close to $55M range domestically for its opening tally."
"6695","@m_gearoid Didn't expect to cry during fucking Shazam. Didn't expect them to his those themes that hard."
"6696","I really enjoyed #Shazam i laughed through out and it had lots of emotion. I just don't think audiences are that interested plus probs saving their money for #AvengersEndgame"
"6697","Took the family to see #Shazam today! So much fun!
@ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel &amp; @jackdgrazer were fantastic as Billy and Freddy. A fresh and fun film from @wbpictures @DCComics .  Looking forward to more of this story!"
"6698","It’s a @ZacharyLevi kind of day. 
First #Shazam this afternoon and now #ThorTheDarkWorld as me and my family get back to our Marvel Rewatch."
"6699","""MCU movies are better than DC's universe movies"" has been a dirty lie starting the day Man of Steel came out but Shazam really is a great example of what a Captain Marvel origin movie can be if people making it actually care."
"6700","@TiffanysTweets @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @adamschlagman @ponysmasher @newlinecinema @wbpictures @DCComics @TheDCUniverse @Cynthia_Rowley Saw it Wednesday evening! Was awesome! #thankyou"

"6703","Wonder Woman, Aquaman and now Shazam!! It was goddamn time for the DCEU to get things rightly on track!!"
"6704","@greentauros That's fucked up. I'm extremely sorry this happened. My friends told me Captain Marvel was good. I don't give a fuck; I'm not watching that fucking movie. Imma watch Shazam instead."
"6705","@ponysmasher shazam was a good movie and all but consider...shazam=Adam Sandler"
"6706","it’s literally just a lego game but i’m so happy he actually voiced shazam in it"
"6707","5 out of 5 for being the first light hearted DC movie ever"
"6708","@ItsYourPlayer2 Most people forget or don’t even know that Shazam was originally captain marvel until the artist sold the rights to DC"
"6709","the poc hero movie we deserved!!!"
"6710","@EthanVanSciver Her face just annoys me. I liked the end game trailer till her smug ass was on it. CM is the complete opposite of Shazam. Shazam is actually comical and it doesn’t try too hard. CM is just a polished mess of nothing."
"6711","“Shazam” is pretty good. Not great, but better than all the recent DCU films. The end credits are a blatant steal from “Spider-Man: Homecoming” but I’ll let it slide because Ramones."
"6712","I’ll be missing #Toonami tonight due to seeing Shazam! However I’ll catch the episodes later on DVR. I haven’t seen the controversial SAO episode but I am aware of it. Just remember to be respectful to those involved in it since they only voice these characters and it’s not real."
"6713","@ZacharyLevi is SUCH a pure, wholesome delight in everything but Shazam! was so well done! So genuinely laugh out loud funny but also so heartfelt. AND I don’t know the last movie that showed the importantance of family you make yourself and I needed that."
"6714","@ZacharyLevi #Shazam #ZacharyLevi What's my name?!! Kids loved it! We all are kids at heart! We need to bring more and revamp back DC characters on the big screen! Success of Wonder Woman, Aquaman and now Shazam definitely helped!"
"6715","In the theatre to watch #ShazamMovie !!!"
"6716","Ok Shazam was the worst movie I've seen in a while. Don't believe internet's lies. It was a kids movie made for grown ups. I don't even remember the last time i wanted to leave the theater in the middle of a movie."
"6717","This movie was teally enjoyable <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>"
"6718","Lights dimming. Trailers starting. See you after the movie. #Shazam"
"6719","Sitting down for #Shazam our seats' backs are down and don't come up. I'm okay with that but sis says she might fall asleep. We even told the #Cinebistro manager."
"6720","""That's actually a great idea!"""
"6721","Just watched Shazam, and was not disappointed! Was fun to watch and would watch again."
"6722","After a little while, made it back from seeing ""Shazam"" and it was just as I hoped it would be, particularly doing so well a job in the power fantasy of a child getting super powers and using them somewhat irresponsibly. Good laughs and another one for the unorthodox family."
"6723","Shazam was truly amazing, the script, the effects, the performances, the story, congratulations @ponysmasher <U+0001F44C>"
"6724","so i've just seen shazam and i'm shocked and delighted to announce that it's the greatest movie ever made"
"6725","Which film are you most excited after Shazam and Endgame?"
"6726","Saw Shazam and it was great but the moment I saw @gracecfulton in the house I was like hell naw I’m about to watch Annabelle again <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"6727","@gloryhinos Freddy didnt say shazam he said captain marvel and he didnt turn into a teenage version of shazam he just turned into himself but as an able bodied person"
"6728","Why follow my Shazam, to unfollow.. then to re-follow??"
"6729","“People like DC films when they are being heroic”
Was Shazam being heroic when he was smashing face first into the sides of buildings or blowing busses off bridges while showing off his powers for money? Did the definition of hero change in the last couple of weeks?"
"6730","Heh, I dropped a couple of followers just by tweeting about SHAZAM!. People may not be happy with the piece I wrote about it. Forewarned is forearmed."
"6731","Shazam has some very winning actors (despite a couple of casting howlers), but it’s too long and very much into its own cleverness. A consistent tone would have helped, because Mark Strong is wasted as a dull villain."
"6732",".#Shazam is even more fun than everyone is saying. To be fair, I'd watch @ZacharyLevi as an extra in a middle school play, but this is a perfect addition to the #DCEU and our girl Darla stole the show.. er, movie. <U+26A1>"
"6733","@Maniklite True that.. #SHAZAM is a entertaining movie. I love Deadpool 1 but the second part doesn't make any sense."
"6734","My DCEU ranking after watching #SHAZAM.

1. Batman v Superman 10/10
2. Man of Steel 10/10
3. Aquaman 8/10
4. Wonder Woman 7.5/10
5. Shazam 6/10

Still waiting for the #SnyderCut and #AyerCut"
"6735","Not gonna lie I expected more than 49M opening weekend, but I don’t believe the budget is too big so it’ll be fine"
"6736","The DCEU continues to move away from it's darker beginnings and embrace the fun side of superheroes, while bringing something refreshingly a little different to the genre.  Some more clarification on some elements would have been nice, but by no means spoils the fun. #Shazam"
"6737","Watched @ShazamMovie tonight and @ZacharyLevi had me shook amazing film especially good in @IMAX <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB>"
"6738","@matt_sawer I almost walked out of Justice League. Batman v superman was shite too. But Wonder Woman and Aquaman both kept me coming back to DC. When I first saw the Shazam casting I was dubious but the trailer looked good so gave a go, and it’s fantastic. Worth a watch."
"6739","@chrisharihar @sepinwall Am I the only one that was somehow really bugged that there were seven Sins and six Marvels? 

It’s like hot dogs and buns

"6741","@ShazamMovie was super fucking good! congrats to @ZacharyLevi and the entire crew! fucking loved it! #Shazam"
"6742","I say the same thing"
"6743","@sepinwall We need more kids movies that scare the hell out of you and stay with you until you’re 25 and rewatch and say oh wow that was terrible. Cheers to Shazam for trying to carry the mantle from The Witches and Gremlins. Both of which were... PG."
"6744","""Shazam!"" was good. As I said in my Aquaman review DC is taking steps in the right direction. Comedy in the movie at points was cringey but there were some that actually had me laughing. Love the idea and tone of the movie but some potential was left untapped. Worth a watch, 7/10"
"6745","Jusr watched #Shazam and I freaking loved it!! Laughed through the whole movie! And the story was great!! Congratulations @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel You were incredible!!! @ShazamMovie

"6747","#Shazam really is as dope as people say it is. Make sure y’all go see it this weekend"
"6748","Go and see the film Shazam! It is super - excellent pacing, characters, plot, pacing, humour and effects. I stumbled across it almost by accident. It was a choice between it and Captain Marvel as I couldn't bear watching the bit in Dumbo when his mother is taken away. Good choice"
"6749","Shazam was legit good. One of the best superhero movies ever, I think."
"6750","@Quezzo_In_HD Shazam. That's what I'm going to see anyway"
"6751","the most unrealistic thing abt shazam! was the characters buying beer at a convenience store in pennsylvania"
"6752","@cindytrimm @cjay_greene Children of the Living God do yourself a favor it's not a Marvel movie it's not a good movie to watch it all Shazam is a witchcraft demonism invitation to the human beings for the dark side. Nothing else but a Darkseid invitation"
"6753","""Let's go see The Flash"" - @DrEvel_hs 
""I didn't know they came out with a flash movie"" - me
""Yeah we saw the previews for it"" 
""When?""
""We've seen it a couple times. You know, Shazam!"" 

To be totally fair, they both do look similar, with lightning bolts on their chest"
"6754","For months last year the media finger-wagged us for not taking super hero movie BLACK PANTHER with sufficient seriousness. 

SHAZAM debuts and we’re lectured that damn it, it’s high time we realize Super Hero movies should be FUN! <U+0001F914><U+0001F612><U+0001F616>"
"6755","I just saw Shazam
honestly, I walked in just wanting to hear Legend in a movie, but it was REALLY good. and it has that guy from Andi Mack. he cute."
"6756","i saw shazam today, yes legend is in it but it’s mostly in the background with people talking over it. still super cool. super hero movies aren’t really my thing but other than that the movie was great <U+0001F44D>"
"6757","SHAZAM: Say what you will about DC movies but this is the first one that just felt serviceable. No real distinct flavor to it. It's slightly funny, with some slightly good action, all kept together by a decent (and long) screenplay and a charismatic Zachary Levi. Inoffensive."
"6758","I:
1. Have many good things to say about Shazam.
2: Hope you had a nice day."
"6759","i said the movie Shazam wasn't interesting but i forgot that in the beginning there's a pawnshop and the Annabelle doll is there. so demons are real in Shazam universe and also superheroes are real in the Conjuring universe. which is almost interesting"
"6760","Shazam was a real mixed bag. Most of it was hilarious and delightful. Levi was great. The kids were GREAT. But I thought the scary and dark bits were really scary and dark and unfortunately (and unnecessarily?) actually way too scary for kids."
"6761","@tickMattock I'm so behind on DC because I was so non plussed after justice League but Shazam looks tonally different enough to be potentially interesting"
"6762","Thanks to @BATMANONFILM and @shewrick for hosting a fun pre-show get-together for their #ATX #Shazam watch party! So great to meet these gentlemen and the others that came! Had a lot of fun talking #Batman80, #Superman, #JamesBond and #StarWars! Can’t wait for the next one!"
"6763","@ShazamMovie Just saw it in IMax earlier and loved it!!! Amazing movie!!"
"6764","#Shazam was entertaining but not great. He didn’t get to be the hero enough. The story didn’t truly allow for the full spectacle. The stage was too small and didn’t know what it wanted to be."
"6765","not only is the movie fun, but it all literally hinges on Zachery Levi's utter charm and humor - now THAT's entertainment!  #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"6766","Oh you guys should definitely see Shazam. It’s super exciting <U+0001F601><U+0001F917><U+0001F483>#ShazamMovie"
"6767","I don’t know if saying @RossButler featured in #Shazammovie is a spoiler but that did it for me, I was screaming and Meagan Good too. The Movie is just really good. Action, humor, cast, everything was perfect. Thanks DC<U+0001F525>#ShazamMovie"
"6768","my opinion on shazam (which nobody asked for) is the following: it’s as if a superhero movie was made in the 70’s but with 2010’s film making technology. which is not necessarily bad but just cheesy with no real stakes or emotional involvement"
"6769","Going to watch Shazam!"
"6770","@YuriAmbassador I never call him Shazam, just never getting used to it."
"6771","@nicklate93 @googamp32 @gavinfeng97 You're right it won't flop (it will be profitable). Based on the current numbers, it's trending toward the $350m to $450m area. Ant-Man's $520m is out of reach, but Shazam is doing just fine. I wouldn't a sequel is locked, but it's more likely than not with the decent numbers."
"6772","@nicklate93 @googamp32 @gavinfeng97 It will certainly not flop (it will be profitable). Based on the current numbers, it is trending toward $350m to $450m. Ant-Man's $520m is out of reach, but Shazam is doing just fine. A sequel is not locked, but it is more likely than not with the decent (not great) numbers."
"6773","@nicklate93 @googamp32 @gavinfeng97 I need to correct you; you compare AMATW's domestic opening weekend to Shazam's worldwide opening. AMATW opened with $161m worldwide, but not counting China and the UK, where it opened much later. Shazam is opening with around $150m, with both countries. Uneven comparison."
"6774","@ArmyBrigade13 @BTS_twt Team Shazam, Spotify and Youtube <U+270A> for sure @BTS_twt"
"6775","No, they’re not. This Shazam has never been Captain Marvel. Carol has always been. It’s not the comics. They’re not connected."
"6776","also the grown up shazam kids were fantastic and also reminded me I watch too much tv because I knew every actor"
"6777","is it too early to get into the ableism in shazam because the film made points but it did some shit"
"6778","found families are my jam so shazam really did get me in my chest"
"6779","I don't do a lot of crossover between my two accounts, but if anyone's curious what I thought of SHAZAM!, here's my review."
"6780","i’m seeing shazam today oof"
"6781","Wait, let me go see Shazam. 
I’ll take Jack with me and anyone else who wants to come."
"6782","This is the best review ever."
"6783","Went to see Shazam! yesterday. What a great movie, it really made me laugh and had the wonderful theme of family throughout. And @ZacharyLevi is still the nicest person I have ever met at a convention <U+26A1><U+FE0F>@ShazamMovie"
"6784","8. #Shazam 

The true #CaptainMarvel. Silly movie with poor effects &amp; boring battles, probably targeting younger audiences

Zachary Levi does a nice job and the best part is when he discovers his powers, together with his friend. There are actually a couple of funny moments."
"6785","I love the both of them but I feel like Shazam and Aquaman got them beat... idk"
"6786","In case I forgot to mention it, #ShazamMovie has an incredibly diverse cast of kid characters that are astoundingly great, using them well especially for that one moment when the entire audience cheered."
"6787","@thischaneyguy @ShazamMovie We chose the right women, @_TinaOrtiz_ and I already have tickets for Endgame on opening night"
"6788","That scene in the apartment building with ""Travis"" is pretty intense."
"6789","To get US Radio Airplay, make sure to always Shazam their songs especially HOME to show that there's demand. If possible, put a request to radio stations to play SEVENTEEN's song. Let's start with iHeartRadio &amp; Pandora!

"6791","Shazam is good, maybe a little on the scary side for little kids but seriously good. Reminded me so much of the comics."
"6792","I’m going to see “us” tonight . I guess Shazam will have to wait until next week"
"6793","I neeed to go see Shazam at the cinema"
"6794","Best believe I’m going to watch Shazam right now!"
"6795","@Actually_Thanos @GodzillaMovie @ShazamMovie Thats why marvel is the best"
"6796","I’m going to see Shazam right now I really hope It’s good I love Dc and all but recent years they haven’t been doing great in the movie department but in any other department they’ve been doing great"
"6797","ShaZam is officially the second best DC movie ever made"
"6798","My 2019 in cinema has been dismal so far - out of my last 10 booked visits I only made it to 2. But just managed to drag myself out for a double bill of Pet Semetary and Shazam!, so hopefully a sign of things to come! #cineworldunlimited @cineworld"
"6799","I guess you forgetting Aquaman's billion already huh"
"6800","@Eofthewest It is virtually impossible for Shazam to fail with it's budget"
"6801","About to see #Shazam 
Hope it lives up to the hype <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB>"
"6802","Waiting for the hot takes on twitter re: #Shazam - specifically whether it did a good job of treating the foster care experience. I was really moved but I am not a FC parent or kid, so I'm listening."
"6803","Hi @Handlebrody I'm sure that not even Seth Cohen would have imagined being a real superhero.
#Shazam"
"6804","Shazam is such a wholesome movie, left the cinema feeling warm and bubbly inside <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"6805","Agreed. I laughed almost nonstop"
"6806","Do yourself a favour and see the real Captain Marvel.  Shazam! is crazy well written and will certainly leave you feeling like superhero"
"6807","@CarterNixon Must admit, that transition made me smile more than just about anything else in SHAZAM (and I smiled a lot)

Also, that older actor really should have been Spider-Man back in the day"
"6808","Fuck Shazam. This movie actively made me a worse human being.

GARBAGE.
I hate myself for watching this movie."
"6809","@ShazamMovie was wonderful and I really enjoyed the character. would love to read some comics @DCComics where should I start?"
"6810","Captain Marvel, er, #Shazam was pretty dang good and very entertaining. It was a movie with a heart that happened to contain super heroes and villains. 
<U+0001F3A9><U+0001F3A9><U+0001F3A9>1/2 out of <U+0001F3A9><U+0001F3A9><U+0001F3A9><U+0001F3A9>"
"6811","Saw Shazam. It was enjoyable over all. Waiting for the sequel."
"6812","Trying to see Shazam!"
"6813","Heading out to see #Shazam with my fellow Mutant. 

Will share my thoughts, later."
"6814","Hope future DC movies will have more of the heart, humor &amp; magic of #ShazamMovie Never got the comic but the movie got to me."
"6815","Shazam didn't even feel like a DC movie. It felt like it was just it's own thing, and I liked that. DC going with unique tones for different movies is a good idea."
"6816","#Shazam (Cough Captain Marvel) might just be the first DCEU movie I’ve seen since Man of Steel.  #ShazamMovie #CaptainMarvel"
"6817","hi i just watched shazam and I LOVED IT"
"6818","So excited! No rain so I could sneak out to watch @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie. Foot surgery didn’t hold me back!"
"6819","Fir those asking, I loved it. Little cheesy at times but 100% fun. 
I'd give it a B+ worth seeing it in the theaters."
"6820","I was lucky enough to get a Saturday night off so I'm seeing #Shazam with @TheModernGafa   tonight since he understands my deep love for every version of Captain Marvel that has ever existed  and my crush on Zachary Levi"
"6821","Shazam - This was loads of fun and the cast is great! It gave me the feeling of a 90’s family film like the original Jumanji, but with some surprisingly dark moments. Seeing this film aaaalmost gives me hope that a live-action Justice League International movie could work."
"6822","Methinks DC took a page out of Spider-Man: Homecoming’s book for the end credits of Shazam."
"6823","Never would've imagined seeing the whole Shazam family on the big screen, what a time <U+26A1>"
"6824","#Shazam was good. Cheesy but good, i really hope DC makes more light hearted movies esp ones centered around batman and superman, comics originally were for kids and we’re all still kids inside"
"6825","The correct ranking of superhero films-
1-Wonder Woman 
2-Shazam!
3-every other one"
"6826","Seated for SHAZAM! Time to see if it merits the exclamation."
"6827","Also the fact that Shazam takes place in Philly and I know/have been to a lot of the places where it was shot is just nerdy neat. I love that he's Philly's superhero.

AND THE FACT WB KEPT THE 3RD ACT OUTTA THE MARKETING IS INCREDIBLE, THEY DESERVE AN AWARD."
"6828","Shazam! was fun. Would recommend. Two post credits scene and I love how it knew what it was."
"6829","Had a great day celebrating my birthday with my boyfriend.
If anyone is considering watching @ShazamMovie, then I can definitely recommend it <U+0001F604>"
"6830","#Shazam coming out just ahead of the grimdark seeming #Endgame genuinely makes me wonder if DC and Marvel have somehow swapped flavors XD
Anyways, Shazam is tons of fun, do yourself a favor and go see it. <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"6831","Love Shazam the app lol"
"6832","When I go to the club, instead of getting my ID out I just shout “SHAZAM!”"
"6833","@Nick34104550 This moron is also forgetting that SHAZAM has a much smaller budget when compared to other DCEU films. It doesn't need to make that much money to be seen as a big success. It'll easily break 600 million and be seen as a huge success."
"6834","all u people complaining about the violence in shazam are pussies"
"6835","Shazam is rather wonderful. Funny enough, it's not nearly as light and fluffy as the trailers let on, but its grim moments are all in service of something more organically positive. I have such concerns for anyone whose heart doesn't grow three sizes in the third act."
"6836","All of this. #Shazam 

spoilers."
"6837","I saw #Shazam last night, I have many thoughts. DM if you want to discuss."
"6838","@3Dor2D I liked both but Captain Marvel was better overall imo. Captain Marvel also had the better 3D imo. Shazam had decent 3D in a few scenes, but more often than not I felt like I didn't need to see this in 3D."
"6839","@Marcus_Theatres I’m in Orland with my son and husband and the theatre smells horrible. It actually smells like urine. This is NOT how I want to enjoy #ShazamMovie"
"6840","I just came out of the theater after watching Shazam and let me tell y’all that movie was SO GOOD if you haven’t seen it go see it right now. Definitely my favorite movie of 2019 so far (although I haven’t watched Us yet)"
"6841","Everytime I successfully shazam a song, I feel like I just caught a new pokemon"
"6842","I was wiping my tears from the previous scene when this happened 

#SHAZAM #ShazamMovie"
"6843","@ZackaryHarper The biggest compliment I could give Shazam is that it looked and felt way way more like a Marvel movie than DC."
"6844","@ZackaryHarper I just saw Shazam and did like it better than Captain Marvel. It’s certainly a more fun movie. Still really liked Captain Marvel though."
"6845","the one time my family doesn’t ask me if I wanna go to the movies with them, they go to see Shazam :( bro wtf I wanted to see that so bad"
"6846","Billy Batson, I choose you...  #Shazam"
"6847","#Shazam does everything right"
"6848","@UpToTASK Thank you I'm tried of hearing shazam is the real captain marvel no he is captain sparkle fingers"
"6849","@LB_Fenrir @UpToTASK Yes I saw it you didnt see my post on here about captain sprinkle fingers it was a joke for people who watched the movie no one got it sadly:/  get over it he is shazam now call him by his name I'm sorry you have to be a dick"
"6850","@LB_Fenrir @UpToTASK Not anymore did you not watch his movie he legit is shazam now yes he used to be captain marvel but he isn't anymore I like shazam better for him tbh"
"6851","@LB_Fenrir @UpToTASK He said this shazam is not captain marvel which he is correct"
"6852","They should have released this movie in November/December"
"6853","You laugh thru the movie"
"6854","@chefdon26 @ZacharyLevi Awesome!  Have the best time ever!

I have a son with Cerebral Palsy and seizures who LOVES LOVES LOVES all things super hero but can’t tolerate movie theaters.  The day #Shazam comes out on video, I will be first in line at the store!"
"6855","Shazam was a real fun time. I’m glad DC seems to be getting back on track with their movies."
"6856","#Shazam second time around is great it really made me think of it as a comic book with heart , humor and the theme of family was just right #ShazamFamily"
"6857","SHAZAM: A fun superhero movie. Which isn’t a bad thing. Not all the jokes landed and some of the acting was Disney Channel-esque but it was a good time, and it embraces what everyone loves about superhero movies. It’s heartfelt and fast paced. Solid 8/10."
"6858","Enjoyed Shazam! @ZacharyLevi two thumbs up! Fun, funny, and family time!"
"6859","#Shazam was AWESOME.A great origin story. It truly kept its unique tone going. This is easily one of my favorite movies from DC. The characters were great especially Billy, Freddy,and Darla. Sivana and the sins were great also.Bring on Birds of Prey  Wonder Woman 1984 and NewGods"
"6860","@batmankm have you seen #Shazam yet??  It’s really good and surprise @smugorange is in it <U+2764><U+FE0F>"

"6863","I expected to enjoy Shazam but I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. So funny and so much damn heart. <U+0001F60D>"
"6864","@MarsNeedsTacos @ZacharyLevi It looks like he is an actual comic book / super-hero fan instead of just a good Actor that’s basically playing a comic book character for the money. This fact alone makes me want to see Shazam that much more, on top of the great reviews its getting from the audience!"
"6865","Saw Shazam, overall enjoyed it. My favorite parts are probably giant spoilers so I'll refrain. Judging by the reaction of the mostly parents &amp; kids audience (with one very out of place, solo 29 year old: me), it's hitting the right notes."
"6866","well i’m leaving to see shazam so tag me with what becky’s wearing since she hates me"
"6867","#ShazamMovie is Phenomenal all the way around. David F.Sandberg delivered a masterpiece of storytelling, humor, and action. The story is very slow paced at the start but once it finds it footing it is fun until the end. Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer are amazing"
"6868","Among some of the things I disliked about #Shazam: its belief that “gentlemen’s clubs” are funny, fun, and good places to get chicken wings."
"6869","SHAZAM! was AWESOME!! The love, care, understanding, passion and respect for the character and @geoffjohns's New 52/current run is there! DC needs to keep doing this to build their universe! Shazam IS the REAL Captain Marvel! #SHAZAM #DC #CaptainMarvel"
"6870","Report this page"

"6876","@michelleborth holding it down in @ShazamMovie hell yea!"
"6877","@markhughesfilms I hope it does well. I’m kinda worried about it’s box office and Hellboy’s. Will Shazam have legs domestically until Endgame releases? I really want it to succeed. This is a good opening of course, nothing to write off, so I’m glad it’s beating those estimates."
"6878","Really enjoyed Shazam, a bit paint-by-numbers in places but it gets away with it as it does it well and has humour &amp; heart. An entertaining movie with some good laughs; Deadpool 2 for the whole family"
"6879","@idahojon7 has the power to make me a winner. #ShazamXbox"
"6880","Just finished was @ShazamMovie great movie two thumbs up finallly @DCComics making movies that people want to see can’t wait for the next one keep it up #MustWatch #movies @TheDCUniverse"
"6881","Captain Sparkle Fingers

Maximum Voltage

I also love the fact that nearly every proposed name instead of #Shazam can be interpreted as an innuendo. Infantile humour atypical for a 15 year old."
"6882","@mockingbird2424 Exactly. I don't get why we have to pit the films against each other and why we can't enjoy both of them. We can also prefer one over the other for different reasons. I loved captain marvel and am sure I'll enjoy Shazam as well."
"6883","Ok, I don't understand why Sivana was the villan in Shazam if they were basically going to give him Black Adams powers?"
"6884","I just watched Shazam and it was incredible! SOOOOO GOOD! Everyone should go watch it! #SHAZAM"
"6885","Saw Shazam! tonight. Got to say very underwhelming major script issue that conflicted with character direction some of the jokes didn't land for me. I didn't get the reason for the ending. It was somewhat enjoyable however very inconsistent. The villain was also bland."
"6886","After seeing #Shazam I’m now longing for a buddy movie crossover between @ZacharyLevi and @TomHolland1996. What do you think @Marvel @newlinecinema @ThatKevinSmith @marcbernardin ?????"
"6887","Listen to these cuties!"
"6888","@Mabel0468 @ShazamMovie Haha. I’m playing Noovie! I love coming early to movie to play."

"6895","I'm not going to RT because the tweets are kind of spoiler-y but if you've seen #Shazam and are interested in a rare take on one particular sequence please jump over to @RafaelCasal's timeline. (And, really, you should already be following him.)"
"6896","@ZacharyLevi I just wanna say Shazam was fantastic and also I met you at comic con in Rhode Island last year you had me crying at that panel keep up the good work my dude"
"6897","Please watch my video it's very good and the word needs to be spread"
"6898","Shazam is doing pretty well and has a budget of 85-90 mil so I dont get these tweets about it being done dirty. Not everything is about shattering records."
"6899","So, Shazam was pretty cool. Honestly not much more to say than that, it was a solid movie and pretty touching in parts."

"6906","SHAZAM is the first movie in a while that—emotionally—I need it to make duffels and duffels of TRIPLE FRONTIER type money."
"6907","@The_Meatball_84 @SamParkerMetal Right? The critics not complaining about how dark Shazam is and complaining about MoS are showing they are biased. Shazam is usually more lighthearted than Superman (comics) it seems, yet Shazam was pretty dark and MoS wasn’t haha."
"6908","@SamParkerMetal Wait, which are the two bright and colorful movies? Because honestly, Shazam was really not that bright and colorful. And I’m okay with that."
"6909","So i came out of the odeon after watching Shazam (it was hilarious) i'm running to get the bus and i see people shouting and throwing bottles of beer at each other.
Just another night in the UK?"
"6910","@ZacharyLevi happy you're in a good place sir. Something that brings joy, laughter, happiness and hope can only reverberate in good ways with people. Glad they chose you as Shazam <U+0001F60A>"

"6921","@sinzubaba True sha...gotta see it thou.
Hopefully the comic feels to the movie gives it that ragnorak edge. As a stand alone i don't fancy Shazam.

But my Superhero split persona would still be happy after viewing it."

"6927","@ZacharyLevi #SHAZAM was great. One of the best DC movies. You caught magic in a bottle."
"6928","This movie is surprisingly amazing to watch the way how the story was told <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F> #Shazam"
"6929","I've just got back from the cinema to see @ShazamMovie what a heap of fun well done to @AsherAngel @ZacharyLevi @RossButler @DJCotrona @Handlebrody @jackgrazer4ya and Carson MacCormac - plus the full cast and crew!"
"6930","@WarnerBros_ph How much money did Shazam gross on opening day here in the Philippines?"
"6931","Much <U+2764><U+FE0F> to @ZacharyLevi and how he’s handled this whole media tour for a big time movie. His humbleness and gratefulness just comes through so wonderfully. <U+0001F917> Truly wish you so much success! P.S LOVED #Shazam! So mich fun!"
"6932","What an actual idiot"
"6933","Any of y’all going to see #Shazam ??"
"6934","Who is ready for a spoilercast for #Shazam ?? We will have one coming soon."
"6935","Shazam was soooo cheesy. Felt like I was watching power rangers. I love it because it’s a DC movie and they are finally lightening up and giving their movies a bit of light. 
Oh and the soundtracks are dope!"
"6936","Omg i can't . I just got out of watching SHAZAM! OMG IT WAS AMAZING. @AsherAngel  you are superhero <U+0001F60D><U+0001F4AF> I cant believe how good it was ane it was even better because asher was in it ! I love him and his acting <U+0001F60E> mind blown . @AsherAngel @AsherAngel  @AsherAngel"
"6937","@EscaflowneClown @CapMarvelFan Shazam will be successful anyway but the problem is if it is not a big hit then they won’t probably make a sequel"
"6938","@markhughesfilms That’s why people don’t deserve good movies! A shitty movie like Captain Robot Marvel made a billion and On the other hand Shazam is Struggling"
"6939","SHAZAM is my favorite DCU film by a mile. Loved every second of it."
"6940","I loved every second. Wonderful turn of form for DC."
"6941","#WhenISayShazam my phone tells me what song is playing through the speakers at whatever location I’m at.

It’s kinda interesting that they didn’t reference or joke about the Shazam app in the Shazam! movie. That’s a wasted opportunity right there, that would’ve been hilarious."
"6942","@gracecfulton loved seeing you on shazam! I've really missed you since Annabelle Creation <U+263A><U+FE0F>
We should go for some starbucks sometime in the future <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"6943","Watched both Captain Marvel and Shazam! today and I definitely know who is #MyCaptainMarvel 

(The one who was forced to change their name for legal reasons)"
"6944","|| I figure my username doesn't make much sense but it's weirdly hypothetical and alliterative. He invokes or brings on the imitation of being an adult with being Shazam so I thought I was being clever."
"6945","Seen #Shazam today at Vue. Didn't expect to find it as funny as I did. Decent watch, however I thought some of the acting was a tad relaxed. Even if those monsters were CGI, I wanted them to look as if they were going to genuinely poop themselves!"

"6947","I’ve sha said what I’ll say Batman Dark Knight Trilogy and this new movies  like Shazam are DC fans claim to fame in the Hero genre for movies. Marvel be killing them sha <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"6948","#Shazam is a darn good film and it’s freaking hilarious. I definitely recommend it. :)"
"6949","@ZacharyLevi Holy Captain Sparkle Fingers #shazam  was AHHH-MAY-ZZZIIINNGGG!!!!!!
#mynewfavoritesuperhero"
"6950","So, I loved it! @ZacharyLevi and the entire cast were great. @ponysmasher did an amazing job at keeping a good balance of tones.

9/10"
"6951","I can now say with pride that I am a Dr. Sivana fan, especially in one particular scene that I won't spoil but damn! Mark Strong was perfect.
#Shazam"
"6952","Shazam is actually really good"
"6953","@ZacharyLevi I went to watch #Shazam today with my parents. Second time watching. It gets better everytime. Looking for a third time. And Zach, all the love to you. My dad left the movie saying that YOU ARE SHAZAM. And I agree. You were born to be Shazam and light up our world."
"6954","Off to see #SHAZAM!...Hmm...nothing happened <U+0001F610>  Oh wells...C’mon damn it change...I really did it once <U+0001F611>

Still excited to see my favorite DC Superhero tho<U+0001F44C> #Yeet"
"6955","Saw Shazam today, no spoilers, but this was a really good movie.  Pay attention because the one liners come fast and furious.  #glitter"
"6956","And now, an amended list of ""Superhero movies guaranteed to make me cry"":
* Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
* Into the Spider-Verse
* #Shazam"
"6957","Shazam was fantastic, heart warming,  heart wrenching at times amd and straight up a good ass time. Nice going into a movie with little to no pc baggage in it."
"6958","Finally saw #ShazamMovie .I loved it. Younger Sisters are terrified. Mum blames me for the nightmares. Life’s good"
"6959","@thatgrltrish #Shazam is my new go-to choice for best Christmas movie discussions and one of the most fun superhero movies yet! 5/5"
"6960","Those scenes with Mike Moran and his wife are indeed some of the greatest in comics history. I'll continue to push Miracleman on people (which is SO much easier now that it's back in print, let me tell you) and hold out hope that the story gets finished some day."
"6961","Gonna see Shazam in a few, I'll give my thoughts on it after it's over!"
"6962","We saw #Shazam yesterday, and I loved it. So did the kids. But it’s more important that I loved it. Go see it. You won’t be disappointed. You don’t have to be a DC fan. Great themes and lots of FUN. 

I dare say it’s the #SpiderVerse of 2019, even."
"6963","@OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie is that supposed to be Darla? please say sike"
"6964","My lonely ass is going to see if they did Shazam justice on screen <U+0001F440>"
"6965","i just read the entire shazam (2019) wikipedia page because i don’t know patience"
"6966","I always check the wrong showtimes and now I have to watch Shazam in Spanish <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"6967","#Shazam was a fun movie. Acting was solid and a nice origin story. I also got the chance to prove to my BF that I was right(as always<U+0001F609>) a mid- And endcredits scene! I'm not a superhero movie fool<U+0001F60F><U+0001F604>"
"6968","@ShazamMovie Was pretty damn good. I'm kinda happy to get to watch a superhero movie that isn't really setting something up. 

That's all the movies have been lately. And while story arcs are cool, it's nice to be able to enjoy something that's apart from everything else."
"6969","@Alex_ShutUp shot and based in philly. there’s a scene where shazam crashes into the ben franklin statue on top of city hall and it lands on the love park sign. the most philadelphia thing I’ve ever seen"
"6970","How long a previews in a movie? 30 min? Can I go 30 min late and still catch the beginning of Shazam?"
"6971","Man, if my phone battery was up, I’d rush out my house to go see Shazam cuz I forgot it was out. But it ain’t worth it now. By the time my phone charges up and I get to theater, it’ll be 7:45 and the showing starts at 7:15"
"6972","@JosheyElls remember the articles when the Shazam logo was released saying this film would be superlight 

and then we got the villain throwing people out of a skyscraper and giant demons biting heads off <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"6973","@OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie put some respect on Eugene's name"
"6974","@ZacharyLevi I just saw Shazam! and I can tell you that it is the best movie ever! So proud of you!!"
"6975","I think DC finally cracked it with Shazam. #Shazam"
"6976","Just to put it out there , Shazam was amaze balls.  #Shazam"
"6977","#SHAZAM was fun! ‘Bout time DC let themselves just commit to being silly and letting the heart come naturally"
"6978","Watched #Shazam for second time.  It is a very fun time. I have a question about the doorways opened by family near end of film.  To me the third door opened that isn’t shown could it possibly be a #GODZILLAKingoftheMonsters Easter egg?  IMAX  trailer Snowing?"
"6979","Saw #shazam in #IMAX last night. What a fantastic freakin’ movie. I walked out of the theatre with a huge smile on my face. Fantastic new addition to the DCEU (or whatever the fuck they are callin’ it now)"
"6980","PSA if anything happened to Freddy Freeman from #Shazam I would physically fight DC. @JackDylanGraz14"
"6981","Off for some delicious Whataburger and to see Shazam."
"6982","Adam Brody is in Shazam and clearly met the same anti-aging witch who blessed Paul Rudd"
"6983","Shazam was wonderful, and @ZacharyLevi stole the show as usual. Go see it."
"6984","@Aubdec @ShazamMovie Saw it and loved it! #Shazam"
"6985","Shazam is the best DC flick since the Dark Knight."
"6986","@cometsandwhales In Shazam!!!! The lights just went up and it turns out they’re like 12 years old I am HORRIFIED"
"6987","Eating sushi <U+0001F363> it’s so freaking awesome with my friend Mala and seeing @ShazamMovie. Omg"
"6988","@OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie If you guys can give me a Mazahs Funko then I'd love you forever"
"6989","Shazam is a great example of how you can make jokes G rated and still be hysterical"
"6990","@chipriggsphoto @YahooEnt I’ve never even watched Shazam dude wtf 99% of the characters in black panther are African, I don’t care about their tribes or whatever because they’re tribes still live in Africa?? Also South African is still in Africa btw"
"6991","@ErinLavertyx You’ll probs enjoy Shazam then hahah"
"6992","Honestly I think Shazam! is the worst film I have ever seen (yes, including suicide squad)"
"6993","Gonna watch two movies today: #SHAZAM  and Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II: Lost Butterfly"
"6994","Holy fuck Shazam is such a diverse movie"
"6995","Going to see Shazam! tonight. Will give a review"
"6996","@ShazamMovie ducking @Marvel fans who are jumping on the bandwagon. 
Myself included. :)"
"6997","So what name should #SHAZAM actually have that could not lose his powers? Captain marvel the orgin would be cool but DC gave up that name in 2011 sadly.  Maybe..Captain sparklefingers?"
"6998","wanted to have super intelligence"
"6999","Shazam out there just terrifying children"
"7000","saw shazam and all i can say is SETH COHEN"
"7001","About to see #Shazam. Hope it’ll be good!"
"7002","can someone please take me to see shazam because there's a twenty one pilots song in there and ITS LEGEND"
"7003","@ShazamMovie is even better the second time around! Took my wife this time and she said it's her favourite comic book movie ever!
@ZacharyLevi #ShazamMovie"
"7004","The only thing I have to say about Shazam other than fun is: Did anyone else think of Dogma with that board meeting scene? I laughed a bit too loud at that..."
"7005","About to watch #ShazamMovie and the movie theater just lost power lol"
"7006","@OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie @OriginalFunko you guys planing on making their kid versions’ funko pop and also Dr. Sivana’s funko?? just wondering"
"7007","@OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie Ok basically they sold out every Eugene funko pop so that’s why Eugene’s funko is not there"
"7008","@OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie Also why  Darla funko’s skin is much lighter then her actual skin tone??"
"7009","@BrianPCunningha @ShazamMovie @SEPTA @PhillyPolice It’s called not wanting to pay for the use of the logos"
"7010","What I’m not gonna do is run into locals while I’m going to see Shazam nope that is not what we’re doing"
"7011","Umm, ok. Now I HAVE to see this movie. I hope #Shazam lives up to the hype!"
"7012","dudeeeee there are particularly two things that gave me goosebumps and made me scream inside the theatre while watching #Shazam 

fuck, this movie was a solid one from #DCEU. <U+0001F60D><U+0001F49C>"
"7013","i really wanna see shazam but no one will go with me<U+0001F614> also i wanna see us again and mid 90s when that comes out but urm same problem i have no friends"
"7014","This is the movie equivalent of that stock photo where all the employees are doing a group high five and all eight of them have different skin tones."
"7015","Seated for shazam. I hope the boy goes into shazam like a nasty flesh mech"
"7016","Just saw #SHAZAM and I can safely say it’s fun, it’s awesome, and it references strip clubs. <U+0001F60A>"
"7017","I’m going to see thisssss"
"7018","Lush evening at the cinema with my man and brother<U+263A><U+FE0F> #ShazamMovie a film I’d recommend everyone should go and see!"
"7019","This genuinely makes me laugh"
"7020","Captain Marvel stays in your mouth even when you’re enjoying your DC faves. Carol’s success really got you that pressed huh?"
"7021","#Shazam was a solid, heartwarming movie. I’m glad to see it continue the DCEU themes of the strength in family. @ZacharyLevi really *is* perfect for Shazam, and Mark Strong gave a great performance. Kudos to the kid actors too!"
"7022","Shazam was actually dope! Definitely a movie to watch."
"7023","Off to see Shazam, hope super hero Big is gonna be good"
"7024","It is better I stay silent on #Shazam as I will give every spoiler but have to say @Handlebrody is super fit ."
"7025","I wasn’t expecting ‘Shazam’ to be so heartwarming with the foster family subplot, but it was like ‘Cheaper by the Dozen’ with Superman and I kind of love that."
"7026","Absolutely loved @ShazamMovie
&amp; @ZacharyLevi Fun! Family! My kids all loved it. Did I also say FUN! @geoffjohns Freddie Fantastic! #SHAZAM"
"7027","@BpopeTV @DJNYC1 @ShazamMovie Seeing in the morning!!"
"7028","Over 270,000 people in Ontario are employed in the arts &amp; culture sector - 4% of the workforce – &amp; they generate $25 billion annually. Approximately $2 billion of that is Film &amp; TV Production, including 50,000 employees as well as spin off jobs, mostly in the GTA. #TOFilm #ONpoli"
"7029","i’ve seen two great thing this weeknd, #Shazam &amp; #TheChillingAdventuresOfSabrina both vastly different, equally great"
"7030","Pet Sematary was okay but kind of disappointing

Shazam was good but suffered from some of the problems with DC writing one dimensional and unrealistic side characters (and some bad acting)"
"7031","@ZacharyLevi i saw Shazam minutes ago and i just want to say you are my new favorite superhero, thank u for being Shazam."
"7032","Ol'Frosty and the little icicles are on the way to the theater to watch Shazam. Loved him as a kid. Hope it lives up to my expectations. #stayfrosty #blackwire #infinitehero #honorchamp"
"7033","While a decent movie, the jury is still out on #Shazam 
Lots comedy and some questionable hero development."
"7034","While a decent movie, the jury is still out on #Shazam 
Lots comedy and some questionable hero development. #DCUNIVERSE"
"7035","If you haven't seen Shazam you need to get on it. It is the Thor Ragnarok of DCEU movies. #shazam"
"7036","@AmePotato This is true they thick they will be our pets they will also learn to say stay hydrated and save the bees alright anyways I gotta go bout to go see Shazam talk to you later"
"7037","@ChiefAnu Agreed and the Shazam being brought in just rubbed me the wrong way, I feel Shazam is a good movie about a kid being a superhero but not a good superhero movie. Does that make sense?"
"7038","@EntryHazzard Idk, I think it may find footing. It’s an odd week. Last week was Us and this week is Pet Cemetary which is two horror film counter programming. I feel like Shazam will do well in the long run and that China may give it life"
"7039","shazam could be one of my favorite movies of all time"
"7040","At tha movies. Told them I wanted to watch Kazaam. She prints me out tickets for Shazam. Told her no. I want to see Shaq as a genie again <U+0001F602>"
"7041","@ZacharyLevi loved your portrayal of one of my favorite @DCComics characters! @ShazamMovie was greatness. It kept me in my seat until the very last credit rolled!"
"7042","I hope y'all love it!!!"
"7043","So apparently, all it takes to be chosen by Shazam! is to be a huge pussy... #5minutesin"
"7044","Seeing @ShazamMovie and first thought: Stop putting Rebel Wilson in movies, for the love of god."
"7045","@Actually_Thanos @GodzillaMovie @ShazamMovie It might be the theaters fault"
"7046","@strwar @ShawnaLeneeShow @mylife4nerzhul @alanaevansxxx @GustavoXBIZ I've seen both and they have their own merits.

Personally,I was totally laughing my butt off most of the time I was watching Shazam and in the good way."
"7047","@Owoicho_ I’m still very much in love with Flash tho, but yeah Shazam is really cool."
"7048","I am very much looking forward to finding out whether or not @megfitz89 likes this movie."
"7049","Just saw Shazam!!! It's pretty good! Mostly bc I'm in Philly rn, it was so wild seeing all the locations in the city like DAMN THAT'S US"
"7050","I absoloutely loved #Shazam so much. Absoloutely hilarious, a very easy to connect with Cast especially the youngsters who did so well with the always brilliant @ZacharyLevi It's a fresh take on the comic book genre and can't wait to see it again."
"7051","Headed to Shazam. Hoping it doesn't disappoint cause this is the first DC movie I've been excited about since dark Knight rises"
"7052","Yo that ending in #Shazam was so unexpectedly awesome, it’s worth a second watch on that alone"
"7053","So I just saw #Shazam and it is really really good! Hands down my #2 DCEU movie behind WW. It was light fun and still had dark moments. It has some horror ellements which I appreciated and overal a really solid story. Go see it if you get the chance!"
"7054","The theater is packed I love locals okay bye now #Shazam"
"7055","@TomBrevoort Any update on when we will see more Miracleman?"
"7056","Saw Shazam. It was nice. Vaguely reminded me of a mediocre Gumball episode stretched out, which isn't a bad thing, Gumball has very few duds. The villain was boring as hell tho."
"7057","@michaelschweitz Took my kiddo to Shazam! In 3D , ate popcorn and m&amp;m’s!!! #momgoals #ShazamMovie #selfcare #SaturdayAfternoonShow"
"7058","I saw a Shazam matinee this afternoon, and now I'm binging season one of Barry, and they couldn't be more different in tone but I love them both?!"
"7059","Excellent movie, @ZacharyLevi killed it!"
"7060","Btw Shazam is such a funny and incredible film! Absolutely adored watching it and not just because me and Cameron had VIP to ourselves and kept jumping about shouting SHAZAM"
"7061","@samueljbernal @studiomogura @Jenklens_ @GeoffThorne @YahooEnt That seems to be changing. Shazam is the first superhero movie in a while to have a white male lead."
"7062","@JsmallSAINTS @ShazamMovie @DCComics I’m interested I’m gonna watch it next week"
"7063","Seen it...loved ot man...awesome story and acting."
"7064","Can Shazam come have lunch with me? <U+0001F602> @ShazamMovie"
"7065","@ComdeyBou61 They pretty much abused the transformation system by yelling shazam too much 
Other then that 
The lightning hands part was extremely funny"
"7066","Ready for the comeback
#5DaysToMapOfTheSoul 
@BTS_twt"
"7067","My boy Billy grew so fast (and I don’t mean that because he turn into a 20 year old man... maybe 30, every time he shouts Shazam)"
"7068","Saw #Shazam with the Teen.
Best DC movie in a while.
Openly weeping adult men in the audience.
Good film."
"7069","Saw SHAZAM. I was hoping to enjoy it more than I did.

Left the theater feeling disappointed, but I am finding more things I liked the more I process it..."
"7070","Off to watch @ShazamMovie !"
"7071","Shazam was the best DC movie since The Dark Knight"
"7072","@dropyourlinen I’m going at some point before Monday. I might take my son to see Shazam first. They shouldn’t have shown so much in the trailers."
"7073","The Santa Claus from Shazam! has to be my favorite thing of 2019"
"7074","Go watch Shazam! It’s the best movie of the year!!!!!!!!!!"
"7075","Shazam was great,  and I wasn't expecting all those other actors near the end xD"
"7076","Possibly a controversial opinion: I think that #Shazam is the better Captain Marvel movie."
"7077","Just saw #ShazamMovie — the best parts were Zachary Levi’s performance, Darla, and everything that focused on how fun it would be to suddenly have powers. The parts that didn’t work for me were the moments when they JUST TRIED SO HARD to inject unnecessary darkness into it."
"7078","Just finished #SHAZAM look for my #YSIB video review in the coming days!

First impression: a fresh mixing of old ingredients makes for a very fun superhero/coming of age film."
"7079","Idc if this isn’t about me but give me a couple more days and I got you"
"7080","The 8-year-old who cheered all the way through is the only review you need."
"7081","@LCHF_TOOLBOX Are you going to see Shazam? I want to see that one."
"7082","The first 20 minutes of Shazam had more emotion than all of Captain Marvel."
"7083","Shazam unlocks his full potential by accepting his new family.
Captain marvel unlocks her full potential by BeLiVEiNG in her self."
"7084","If anybody is bored tonight, go see #ShazamMovie. It’s really good."
"7085","I’m in a @Fandango article!!!!!!!"
"7086","If you're torn on seeing Shazam don't be, go see it."
"7087","Enjoyed Shazam!!!!! Started off cheezy but fell in love with it"
"7088","So @spiritland me and my friends had an amazing dinner at your royal festival hall restaurant tonight. Service, food was great. The music was amazing! we spent a lot of the evening shazam’ing. I’ll deffo be back"
"7089","It's the kind of positive vibes we could all use through these tough times #Shazam #ShazamMovie<U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF>"
"7090","Why is @ShazamMovie so awesome? Well DC somehow managed to make Billy Batson a character that we can all relate to. Someone looking for meaning and purpose in this world, someone looking for a reason to believe. The perfect hero movie if you asked me #Shazam"
"7091","I rate shazam 9.5/10

And the reason why it lost 0.5 is because HE FLOSSED FFS"
"7092","Surprisingly, Shazam is a phenomenal time at movies. It has heart, promotes good values, has fresh take on storytelling and it is just so much fun to watch! #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"7093","@TheComixKid Any chance we see A Superman movie in the next 5 years? I need that Shazam/Supes team up."
"7094","Went and saw Shazam with My daughter, it was REALLY GOOD! I’m usually an MCU fan and have been critical of the DCU... DCCU? But they really got it right with Shazam! Shazam &gt; Captain Marvel... yeah I said it."
"7095","I might be the only person on the planet that isn’t bothered about seeing the Shazam movie, but Zachary Levi is such a good dude that I’m definitely going to go see it."
"7096","#SHAZAM is an actual good movie I enjoyed from the DC side of stuff."

"7098","A friendly warning about Shazam: it’s mostly cute and fun, but there are a couple razor blades hidden in it. There’s some fatphobia and disabledphobia baked into the third act, and it’s a huge oversight. (“Ideal”/“super”bodies in the story erase fatness + disability)"
"7099","It’s so great. I left the movie giddy af"
"7100","My followers have til next week to see Shazam and then i’m sharing my theories which might contain spoilers"
"7101","#Shazam is the best comic book movie in this recent century."
"7102","Is-is this a spoiler"
"7103","Need this"
"7104","So, I didn’t go see Shazam this weekend. My brother and I went to watch The Sisters Brothers instead.

It was pretty good. Paced well, great atmosphere, manages to be funny AND chilling at different points - I’d recommend it if you’re not feeling like superheroes this weekend."
"7105","So many seniors in SHAZAM! LOL! Do they actually enjoy it or would they rather be knitting? I think it's cool but do they truly  know Shazam is the real Capatin Marvel? <U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914>"
"7106","More Matt thoughts on #Shazam from the one n only @MattTheCatania (say his name and you may summon him or his cat depending on the time of day)"
"7107","The best part of shazam was the avengers trailer"
"7108","#Shazam was really dope. It’s in the same neighborhood as Spider-Man: Homecoming honestly. DC, and Geoff Johns, may have turned this damn ship around"
"7109","@ShazamMovie Nah I'm good chief... everytime somebody does that dance my pee pee goes soft and I lose all interest <U+0001F612>"
"7110","@hughhowey And Shazam has an interesting history with Marvel’s latest superstar Captain Marvel! Pretty cool that both movies came out this year and that they’re both great."
"7111","Gotta say is not our beloved Captain Marvel AT ALL but really enjoyed the movie, mainly because I'm a big kid."
"7112","@iDavey You and me both! I'll probably go see it again next week. I was more than impressed. They made Shazam such a cool character."
"7113","Shazam was pretty good. Definitely enjoyed it. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being the best superhero flick of the year."
"7114","My non-spoiler review for @ShazamMovie is now available to read on my blog. #nickkohler #nickthemoviecritic @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @ponysmasher @djimonhounsou @wbpictures @DCComics #billybatson #ShazamMovie #wordpress #review #markstrong #jackdylangrazer @WordPress #wordpress"

"7129","Finally had a chance to see #Shazam and I can say, without a doubt, it surpasses the original 1940s serials AND the '70s TV show."
"7130","But in complete earnesty, @ShazamMovie was fantastic. A total blast to watch; it reveled in the fun of superhero stories while still having plenty of weight and heart. Loved what it did with the lore, and in bringing the character home. @DCComics struck lightning with this one."
"7131","@charlieridgely @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie I meant the actual social post. I know they’ve been around for a minute but for the most part people were unaware of them especially if they hadn’t seen the movie."

"7143","#Shazam was one of the best comic movies I've ever seen.  I loved it.  They got so much of what I've wanted from a Captain Marvel/Shazam story all in one movie and it didn't feel like it was too much.  Do yourself a favor and see this in theaters."

"7147","@CedricAndre I can understand Shazam. But it’s more nuanced than that. Usually minority supporting characters fit into a type and rarely have personality. Almost all of the supporting characters are shown as likeable and complex characters all on their own."
"7148","They played the trailer for the live action Dora the Explorer movie at Shazam, but all I could do was snicker from remembering the College Humor version a few years back."

"7150","I'm glad DC is moving away from the grim DCEU with its recent movies. Wonder Woman and Aquaman were great, and Shazam gets what's possible with a DC property when it's so out there. It's amazingly fun. The first DC movie I've watched in theaters. You nailed it @ponysmasher"
"7151","This, so much!"
"7152","The credits were so cool. Like Aquaman's were beautiful but Shazam were super fun and it makes you want to see Shazam join the rest of the League."

"7156","I honestly hope that #SHAZAM does great at the Box Office cause the things this film set in motion are super exciting. We could....SPOILERS see the Monster Society of Evil for the sequel and that is damn awesome. I also want to see Shazam join the rest of the League alongside..."
"7157","Finally getting to see @ShazamMovie ! Excited."
"7158","You guys! Shazam was so good. I liked it better than Aquaman. It’s very much Geoff Johns take versus classic Big Red Cheese but captures some of the feel of the classic stories for sure."

One question:  Has anyone ever seen Zachery Levi and Jimmy Fallon in the same place at the same time?  I'm just curious."
"7162","@TheCCCPodcast @JerryOrdway @geoffjohns @1moreGaryFrank I need to read these as my reference point for the longest time was the 80's and 90's period. Though with the 80's mini that is when #Shazam maintained the personality of a kid."
"7163","Caught Shazam! earlier. 4/5. Some effects are wonky, scenes feel rushed at times, and it's got weird tonal shifts, but damn if it isn't a lot of fun, with great performances. Freddy stole the show. It just never really felt like Captain Marvel/Shazam from the comics."
"7164","@OdinsMovieBlog My MCU ranking is close to these results. DCEU is much different though:(This is what I enjoyed most not what's made better)
1. Aquaman

5. Wonder Woman (An exact copy of CapA:TFA. Third act was bad)

"7186","What’s interesting about @ShazamMovie is that it has a Christmas setting &amp; the post credits sequence has a nod to Aquaman that almost seems to suggest he hasn’t done too much in the DCU yet.

"7190","#Shazam is another step in the right direction for the DCCU. Fun, light-hearted and filled with heart and laughs, Shazam is earnest, captivating and surprising. The film isn’t perfect, but it overcomes it’s problems fairly quickly, leading to a fun and heart-warming third act."

"7292","@ZacharyLevi Congratulations on the @ShazamMovie!! Bought tickets and my daughter and I are seeing it tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.!!"
"7293","Shazam review - excellent use of the mythology. Good timing on all the jokes. CGI felt were intergraded and not just another green screen. Pacing was a tad bit off at time , but nothing that ruined the experience. Overall this movie proves understanding these characters matters."
"7294","@NintenZ I wasn’t interested in wonder woman, I wasn’t gonna touch justice league with a ten foot pole, I wasn’t gonna see Aquaman because I think Aquaman is stupid, and Shazam is admittedly the one I’m slightly interested in and might consider seeing but probably won’t because its -"
"7295","Shoutout to all the assholes who apparently don’t know how to behave in a movie theater! At least I got to enjoy most of Shazam."
"7296","@TAGintheGame Yes, but the Shazam movie would have worked with or without them."
"7297","@bigheadjosh92 It’s a shame Shazam will be the final DCEU film, but at least they can regroup and focus on individual films"
"7298","It’s ‘Big’ on steroids with a hint of Ghostbusters. A comedy that focuses on the discovery &amp; importance of family before being a superhero film. Shazam! was really enjoyable with great nods to the fellow DC world. Sure, some things I wasn’t fond of, but overall a great entry!"
"7299","#Shazam is probably DC’s best movie <U+203C><U+FE0F> a MUST SEE <U+203C><U+FE0F><U+203C><U+FE0F>"
"7300","Took the boys to see Shazam. Really awesome movie and super funny."
"7301","Say my name ;) That was A-MAZING!! Haven't laughed so hard watching a movie in a long time. Had the right combination of everything- action, humor, magic, heartfelt story and amazing acting #Shazam"
"7302","Probably Shazam is far from being a good tool for identifying similarities in generated music! Hopefully someone familiar with the master Piano works of the kinds of Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninov, and a good pair of detective ears can better identify pieces that inspired the <U+0001F409>."
"7303","Shazam said, after just 2 seconds, that the tune is (like) Chopin’s Op. 72, Nocturne No. 19. The tempos are different and on a first listen it’s hard to see/hear the similarity, although the piece definitely sounds like a Chopin piece."

"7305","Even though it looks corny I wanna go see Shazam . That’s one of my favorite DC characters so I’m curious to see what the movie like"
"7306","@CalessDavis Shazam and aquaman top two for me aswell"
"7307","I know which <U+0001F4FD><U+FE0F>I would choose if I had a choice but will have to wait and see <U+0001F440>what the @OHCRutland members want to see <U+0001F39E><U+FE0F>"
"7308","Shazam is probably my favorite superhero movie ever. I think DC has a very bright future."
"7309","He writes all of Cardi’s songs so she returning the favor and making him face forward RT @GeorgeFoster72: So I used Shazam to see who sings this song. This fella is named Pardison Fontaine. Did not expect that to be the name lol. New rappers come out every 2 hours huh lol"

"7311","@alvaroalonsor @DCComics @ShazamMovie I liked it as a comic fan and I'm my late 20s"
"7312","@JkhuluMustang @DCComics @ShazamMovie I understand but Shazam, WW and Aquaman all got live action films don't be salty."
"7313","I’m out of shazam"
"7314","Shazam! was incredible, might be one of my all time favorite comic book movies 10/10"
"7315","DC is on a roll! Aquaman was fantastic, and now Shazam! As sloppy and discombobulated as the DCEU and it’s plans seem now, there’s no denying that they’ve made quality movies recently. I’m heavily anticipating #TheJoker as well"
"7316","@E_IrelandSmith @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie No. But I was trying to see my nephew’s reactions to it, so I missed parts of it."
"7317","Even better the 2nd viewing"
"7318","Just watched Shazam, and I’d say it’s one of the better DC movies out there"
"7319","How does Shazam introduce himself with out converting back to Billy Batson"
"7320","there’s a gay in shazam I repeat there’s a homosexual in shazam"
"7321","Why are you going to see #Shazam"
"7322","Shazam was not good drama, not good action, and not funny. But it was cute

2/10 #liztomatoes"
"7323","Wow. Just got out of Shazam and it was GREAT. It might be too early to say but I think it's DC's best film since The Dark Knight Rises. DC finally took  MCU notes and made a great film"
"7324","Pretty sure #Shazam has a Last Dragon reference in it. A bunch of the Black people laughed and I’m not sure everyone else got it.. <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"7325","I have to see this movie!"
"7326","@thatarin I saw Shazam today. Which rules"
"7327","Part of Slow Hands by @NiallOfficial is in @ShazamMovie and I may or may not have almost screamed when I heard it"
"7328","About to see Shazam. Hopefully it’s better than Aquaman was."
"7329","Just got home from @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi &amp; castmates were all great. My kids loved it. As a former foster family (now adoptive!) it’s refreshing to see movies that show foster and adopting families in a positive light. Thanks and great job!"
"7330","Just got out of the movie theater for Shazam! 

Very very good, cute and fun with enough plot to keep you invested!

7.5/10 would absolutely recommend and see again."
"7331","Everyone is mentioning some sort of glorious Godzilla IMAX footage before Shazam and all I got was a Far From Home trailer with 2 or 3 scenes that I’m not sure if were in the last trailer and weren’t even interesting"
"7332","@ZacharyLevi was brilliant in #SHAZAM! This is the absolute best movie DC has put out! Everyone needs to go see this movie now!!!"
"7333","@rodjoh The hits keep coming <U+0001F602>
Tho I do wonder where articles like this were for every other movie villain? 
Scarface, taxi driver, every Marvel bad guy, all who are shown as sympathetic and relatable. 
The bias is real. 
Even saw Shazam being dragged for fat shaming <U+0001F602>"
"7334","Saw #SHAZAM a second time and I loved it even more than the first time!"
"7335","Overall, the heart, humor, and heroics formula is working well for DC! Let’s hope they keep it up in their main line films while keeping the darker experimental stuff in their true off shoot films like #JokerMovie #SHAZAM"
"7336","The action is great! I cannot believe this film cost less than $100 million, it’s so well done! The flying is very similar to the flying done in #ManofSteel #SHAZAM"
"7337","Video review coming very soon, but #Shazam is now seen and it is fantastic. Literally everything I could possibly have wanted, along with a dozen amazing moments I didn't expect to ever get. See it."
"7338","Shazam deff if the best DC movie I’ve seen in a long time"
"7339","@thatgrltrish Just saw it! Really enjoyable and lighthearted. Levi is great as Shazam and his goofy interactions with Freddy are hilarious. 4/5 <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F> Go see it!"
"7340","Do yourself a favor and go watch #Shazam Its funny, charming, campy,  and an all around great movie."
"7341","Shazam was fun and definitely had a better understanding of how to do a superhero than most of the other DCEU titles"
"7342","shazam spoilers!!!

“say my name” “BILLY” and all of them being super together maybe i cried"
"7343","shazam spoilers/

he showed marilyn the compass and she said what is this . my heart broke like you could hear it"
"7344","@DorianParksnRec @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie Yuuuuuuuuuuupppppp. They already had cars for each of them, in stores last week."
"7345","@thatgrltrish I would love to go see Shazam and Dumbo, but I am stuck in a nursing home rehabing from a broken hip.  I really would like to be anywhere but here.  I have an AMC Stubs A+ membership, so I going to binge so many movies once I escape."
"7346","@liberalnotlefty Shazam is really good in that regard. And also really good movie."
"7347","how gross i’m at the movie theatre and i’m not seeing shazam for the third time i’m seeing something else how tasteless"
"7348","I didn’t expect to tear up, let alone have it look like I had a seizure, when watching Shazam but that ending really shook me."
"7349","@ponysmasher  am I right if I say I spotted Annabelle making an apperance in #shazam ?"
"7350","Fantastic film! DC finally on the way up and getting the respect they deserve"
"7351","@blumspew Congratulations friend <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F389><U+0001F389>  I can't wait to watch #Toonami tonight yeii <U+0001F603><U+0001F64C>"
"7352","Shazam is the movie DCEU should have lead with. #shazam"
"7353","@ShazamMovie was really good (Mild spoilers), I enjoyed it. Loved the 7 deadly sins, LOVED the fact it went bold and gave us MR Mind  <U+0001F41B> only negative, I didn't like the Shazamily towards the end much, was a bit on the nose and boring, would've been better if it was just Shazam."
"7354","It really is frustrating to spend your time doing research and looking for data and then having other accounts take it without even crediting.

This is not the first account this happens with nor the first time this account does it. Please stop this, it’s annoying."
"7355","It really is frustrating to spend your time doing research and looking for data and then having other accounts take it without even crediting.

Please stop."
"7356","its time to see Shazam"
"7357","#Shazam was even more delightful than I expected and my bar was set high. @ZacharyLevi is always flawlessly adorable and my favorite."
"7358","Rafael is spot on about the end of Shazam"
"7359","@shandrick @NomadDeejay @_joshpray dude dwayne johnson produced Shazam, and they set Black Adam up in the movie. no reason a Black Adam film isn't happening."
"7360","Shazam was really really good!
I'm actually so happy because my first DC movies that i finished watching was Shazam!~~"
"7361","Anyway back to the positives, Shazam is such a good movie and it filled my heart with love and it’s just a really fun &amp; funny movie!"
"7362","@ShazamMovie Wish you would be a model studio and demonstrate your ""director-driven"" claims by releasing the Snyder cut of Justice League.  

 #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"

Whimsical and amazing 
Decent building/pace 
THE ENDING OMFG LOL 
the different doors XD 
SHAZAM!  

I can't wait to see it a 2nd time tomorrow"
"7364","@lakersn50907105 @leomuricy @DanielRPK Shazam probably has the best 3rd act out of the recent cbm lol"
"7365","@TooComics @DCComics @ShazamMovie What are you living in a fcuking dream world?"
"7366","@JeremySimser @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie These figures have actually been out for a few weeks."
"7367","SHAZAM is a lot of fun."
"7368","have none of u seen it this is hilarious"
"7369","guys shazam was actually pretty good zachary levi really was perfect for that role"
"7370","@ShazamMovie  is excellent. Well done @ZacharyLevi  YOU ARE IT. Awesome film"
"7371","I just got out of the cinema, and let me tell you, SHAZAM IS THAT MOVIE!!!!!"
"7372","@ZacharyLevi My wife and I saw SHAZAM today and absolutely loved it.  Excellent job and thank you and your co-stars for such a wonderful performance.   Looking forward to seeing the next installment!"
"7373","also i just saw shazam and no spoilers but billy isn’t straight ive spoken it into existence"
"7374","btw spencers didn’t have any shazam snapbacks and that’s homophobic"
"7375","Saw @ShazamMovie round 2 and still loved it. Seriously try and go see it this weekend. It's awesome. @ZacharyLevi #shazam"
"7376","And the thing is, comic book Sivana is actually a timely character given the permeation of internet trolls. Sivana is the first Troll of comicdom. To throw away all the potential of that is unforgivable to this Shazam fan."
"7377","There are some good, albeit brief, moments. The Shazam family and...okay, one good moment. I'm also really not down at all with having the Wizard be indirectly responsible for creating a villain as well as his half assed attempt to find someone ""worthy"". That was just damn dumb."
"7378","Didn't care for Shazam. Been a while since I've seen a movie without a single honestly earned emotional payoff in spite of the herculean efforts it takes to be unrepentantly emotionally manipulative. But worse is the infuriating misreading of the villain Dr. Sivana. #Shazam"
"7379","Was pleasantly surprised by
 Shazam!

Also geeking out over there being two Captain Marvel movies the same weekend."
"7380","I'm pretty sure there was a intentional  reference to the movie ""Big"" in Shazam"
"7381","Just saw #Shazam and it was a whole boat load of fun! Highly recommend for the whole fam. Congrats @ZacharyLevi! I needed and appreciated the laughs."
"7382","Imma go and watch this"
"7383","The lesson to be learned here is to never let @abby_higgins5 look up showtimes for a movie"
"7384","I enjoyed the heck out of #shazam Not too much given away by the trailers. Fun!"
"7385","#Shazam was pretty fun for what it was. A bit too SaturdayMorning 4 me but not being an expert or fan of the character I had no expectations. Surprisingly,  I enjoyed Billy's backstory more than the jokes &amp; action. That was enough for me, the movie wouldn't have worked otherwise"
"7386","@ZacharyLevi went to see Shazam this evening &amp; just wanted to say that it was brilliant, sooo much fun. Can't wait for Shazam 2 <U+0001F91E>"
"7387","5 years ago I walked out of Batman v Superman feeling so dead inside. Tonight walking out of #Shazam I feel fantastic. Fun, emotional, and that right level of dark that DC movies should have been striving for since day 1. Don't miss this."
"7388","SHAZAM was everything I’ve wanted in a superhero movie. SHAZAM said fuck ya villain we’re going to give our hero quality family time and good character growth and I eat that shit UP"
"7389","This Thursday, we had ANOTHER INCIDENT HAPPEN. My friends and I paid $30 each on tickets and concessions to go see the most important movie of the year, @ShazamMovie. AND THE SCREEN WENT BLACK FOR FIVE MINUTES, you guys."
"7390","Most theaters would try to make this right. They would offer a free ticket and concession to replace the movie we missed the most important scene on. 

But @catheatres is refusing to issue any kind of customer service with straight up lies and I for one, am DONE."
"7391","When we, again, approached the manager, we were lied to YET AGAIN. “It was a weather issue.” #lie I walked out to the lobby and all lights were running, popcorn was popping, and there were other theaters loud and boisterous with a movie. Yet, Shazam was black!!! @catheatres"
"7392","SHAZAM! is.....fine. Whatever. I don’t care. Antartica is melting. I think Lady Gaga is a really interesting artist. Zachary Levi is a hoot. The movie has like two jokes that it repeats for 2+ hours."
"7393","Jilliana is taking me to see Shazam and I’m so hype"
"7394","WOWOWOOWOW Jillian is taking me to see SHAZAM now that’s love"
"7395","The positive critical reception on its own is very powerful too. Bumblebee and Shazam were both low budget productions that will make less than the other entries in their series of films, but the positive critical reception helps a lot from their perspective."
"7396","I feel that Shazam will have the same reaction from people that Bumblebee did. Its a movie that primarily focuses on having character and heart, with action while still being there takes a back seat, and fans won't like this change cuz they want more cool action from superheroes."
"7397","This wasn't meant to sway anyone to love Shazam or anything, I'd say see it and judge for yourselves, I personally enjoyed myself a ton and hope DC continues on this path with some character driven movies like this and Joker. I just hope these movies don't flop."
"7398","Shazam has a lot of heart and is very fun throughout, there's good character work and the actors do a good job. Despite that though, there are people that come to these superhero movies for one reason, action. I've already seen a few not like  Shazam for its lack of action."
"7399","With Shazam, a lot of the movie isn't with big superhero battles unlike most of the previous DC movies like Aquaman for example. A lot of the movie is about Billy and his development, but people out there won't like that more time was spent on character than action."
"7400","my fav part of shazam is when sans shows up"
"7401","might have accidentally seen a spoiler for shazam on the offical funko page of all places. stay safe out there kiddos :("
"7402","What do #MK11 and #Shazam have in common? Both former underdogs, but both are way better than their recent competitors, Street Fighter V and Captain Marvel"
"7403","@ZacharyLevi Already watched twice and gonna see it again tomorrow. Absolutely loved it, you sir were born to play this character. Loved everything about it. Well done #Shazam #ShazamRules"
"7404","Shazam was actually really good. The CGI could have been a lot better but I'm not too focused on how effects look -- as long as I'm not looking at a PlayStation one skybox or wall texture or something. 8/10, I recommend."
"7405","So this what you're doing now. <U+0001F636>"
"7406","#Shazam was everything I hoped it to be and more. My favourite DC movie, full of humour and heart."
"7407","@ShazamMovie The best movie in 3 years from DC add Shazam to the Justice League 2"
"7408","@DCComics @ShazamMovie The best DC movie in 3 years it funny and the best adventure right in DC Comics history and Can’t wait For the Sequel . I like that they have added new characters to the DC family"
"7409","i just saw #SHAZAM with my mom and it’s now my favorite #DCEU movie!! i’m enjoying the new direction #DC has been taking with their recent films, having fleshed our solo films is what they really needed"
"7410","Is it possible for a movie to be better the second time around? #ShazamMovie"
"7411","@EWDocJensen It is the most perfect example of the modern superhero movie model DC has made! #Shazam"
"7412","@DarrenFranich How would you rank the #Shazam mid/post credit scenes?"
"7413","@khan_zaiyan What... literally everyone has known that the shazam family is in the movie"
"7414","so I just saw Shazam.
 I’m so unbelievably happy I chose that over 5 feet apart because holy shit what was a good movie"
"7415","@nowayjeff Me too bro, I'm a mess, but it's for the job, I went to cinema to watch Shazam, it's very cool, nice which  show will you going to attend bro?"
"7416","I... I want them all."
"7417","So, yeah, #Shazam will probably become a go-to Christmas movie for me every year."
"7418","Off to see @Shazam! This is either going to be hilarious or really stupid. But it’s got Chuck in it, so it can’t be all bad. <U+0001F604>"
"7419","Getting a popcorn kernel stuck in your gum is the ultimate punishment for cheating on your diet <U+0001F37F> #diet #keto #fail #momlife #Shazam"

"7421","@ItsTrashCulture Yeah but I’m Shazam the end said something like “The 7 realms will come together”"
"7422","Just watched Shazam, definitely worth the watch. As a movie goer, instead of watching the movie and analyzing it like I do. The movie gave me hope as it was a DC movie;most aren’t good. I felt like a kid, watching Spider-Man for the first time. This movie is 9/10 in my book."
"7423","#SHAZAM is a ton of fun and you should go see it now"
"7424","@ZacharyLevi please, we need #Shazam part 2 very soon!!!!

Saludos from Dominican Republic"
"7425","Was Shazam and pet sematary any good?"
"7426","Shazam is a really good movie!

I am such a trash for MCU movies, and had not any desire to watch any DC movies because i thought it would be too dark, lol.

But surprisingly, after watching the trailer of #Shazam months ago, i feel like i should watch this movie no matter what!"

"7428","If DC can keep making movies like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam! they will be just fine."
"7429","Finally got to see #Shazam - which was a total delight. And for my money, the only good new!DC film."
"7430","Shazam was fun, best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises. Unfortunately the theater was half empty on opening weekend. #SupportGoodMovies"
"7431","@mugiwara_noah @ShazamMovie got a fantastic A grade from audiences via @Cinemascore, so it’ll have great word of mouth that should translate into good legs. There’s plenty of room for it to hold well week to week and finish with strong box office totals."

"7439","Wow, #Shazam was actually pretty damn great! I was worried b/c a. it’s DC &amp; b. the same ppl who were telling me how great Shazam is we’re also the ones who told me Aquaman was good (&amp; good lord does that film blow). Glad to be pleasantly surprised! #FreddyFTW"

"7450","@robchristianson @trakand_elayne Just saw Shazam and is definitely one of the best DC movies. Still like Wonder Woman is better. Thought Shazam would have been better had it been about 20 minutes shorter though."
"7451","My oldest took me to see #Shazam.  Good job, @ZacharyLevi and all involved, thank you for doing right by one of my childhood superheroes!"

"7453","this."
"7454","Got to see #Shazam today in theaters.  Very satisfied.  It's far better than any previous DC film, and competes well with Marvel's movies of late.

I'm def worried how Marvel will survive post-Endgame when they seem to be buckling a bit, whereas DC is finally hitting its stride"
"7455","@ZacharyLevi The movie was good.  Well done as shazam.   Just went and saw it with my kids.  Loved it."
"7456","Shazam probably the best DC movie ever made imo 10/10"
"7457","#SHAZAM was really good, definitely at the top of my #DCEU ranking along with #Aquaman. Kind of surreal that the world now has A tier movies with #CaptainAmerica and Shazam!"

"7472","Just took my 15 year old niece to go see #shazam It was fantastic!!!! I had to agreed that we only go see future movies with each other! <U+0001F642> We loved it so much!!! Great job @ZacharyLevi &amp; @AsherAngel &amp; cast!! LOVED seeing @smugorange i whisperd ""Oooo Its Jerry!"" <U+0001F923>"

i found this song i haven’t heard in about 8 months and i just found it a few days ago. god bless"
"7476","@IMAX @ShazamMovie So if you can't go see it in IMAX then don't bother going to see it all. Message received."
"7477","Shazam was different than the other DC movies and I'm ready to see how everything incorporates with each other"
"7478","My review of Shazam!

It has... has good parts, but it could have been better. The potential was there. However, the fact that DC is even attempting to make superhero films that aren’t dark and broody is huge for them, and they should do more. Shazam 2 will probs be better."
"7479","But SHAZAM makes it work and keeps things relatively low scale even if it’s implied the fate of the world hangs in the balance. It gives you all the pieces to appreciate the world it takes place in and if you can accept magic and shit you can easily accept a talking caterpillar"
"7480","Honestly have to admire both the restraint of SHAZAM to not blow its load on the casting of the Rock as Black Adam, saving that for a later film, &amp; also the audacity to set up Mr. Mind as the next villain cuz oh boy if there was ever a concept that’d be hard for audiences to get."
"7481","@BTSxWisconsin @BTS_twt Anybody else getting no result on Shazam for Persona? I never had that until today?@bts_twt"
"7482","@HarrisHarrisev9 Seeing this movie and how the villain was treated honestly made me so excited to see Black Adam in his solo movie and in a Shazam sequel."
"7483","Hi @ZacharyLevi Really enjoyed Shazam! today, what a brilliant film! Hope the movie has an awesome global run, our showing (in Newcastle) was packed with a lot of very happy people on Saturday afternoon! Great job buddy!<U+0001F44D>"
"7484","@ComicGents shazam! described in one word (Great!) Video review on YouTube coming soon! #Shazam"
"7485","If I was guarding Jerome, the next time he did that little elbow push off, I’d flop like I was hit by Superman, Shazam, Thor, and a speeding bus to make the ref call something. His created space is bullshit."
"7486","#SHAZAM Verdict: Totally delightful! Very glad I went to see it. So many of our friends from TV are there, and the execution is top-notch."
"7487","I wanna go see Shazam but I’m scared of seeing 2 bad movies back to back"
"7488","Shazam was good but really pushes the edge of PG-13."
"7489","@demongrimalkin Try watching Shazam later!"
"7490","I didn't enjoy Lights Out or Annabelle 2. Then @ponysmasher made one of my favorite movies of 2019 to date with Shazam! Unfortunately Shazam! seems to not be doing so well at the box office, showing that he was right the first two times to not try and appeal to me."
"7491","Now that the movie is out should I be wearing my Shazam shirt more or less often."
"7492","Agreed, I went in hoping it would be good and it was so much better than good! It was awesome and funny and worth seeing!"
"7493","guys shazam was SO CUTE and it really made me want a good and connected dceu <U+0001F97A>"

"7496","Shazam is one of the best films about superhero’s it’s got a family thing that most films dont have I can fully say that it’s defo worth a watch for anyone who’s thinking about seeing it to end it off Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F> #ShazamMovie <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"7497","My #Shazam review not that anyone cares: 

I massively enjoyed it. It was a little slow getting to the “superhero” stuff and a little sporadic, but it was a blast. It was cheesy (because it’s supposed to be), the music was great, it had action and so much heart. I loved it <U+0001F495><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"7498","@Pokezard It makes sense it's for younger audiences because shazam originally is a kid who has super powers so you see it will mostly be kids looking up to the movie."

"7500","Mk- I’m finally about to see @UsMovie after a couple weeks fret with crippling social anxiety. I saw Shazam the other day, and now it’s time for this mind-meld of horror. Bring. It. On. <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F64C>"
"7501","@marinkd Shazam spoiler with no context"

"7503","Watch #Shazam and you'll see <U+0001F601>"
"7504","ok but Adam Brody in Shazam was really Seth Cohen coming full circle"
"7505","@ZacharyLevi #Shazam has soooo good! Our whole family went together. Top 10 favorite movie for me"
"7506","@WarnerBrosEnt finally marvelized @DCComics movies. Weak script, lots of jokes. Such a shame! #Shazam"
"7507","@sarimeylinda @SEN1227 @geoffjohns @dc_jp @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @1moreGaryFrank Eh, would someone with the courage of Achilles and Wisdom of Solomon run? No matter his original age? Even 14 year old Billy wasn't a runner,that's why he had no fear outwitting the cops. He ran because the character was being played for jokes. Not because that's what he would do"

"7523","Wow guys. #Shazam just blew me away. This might be DC's best film, and I don't say that lightly. Heck, it might be the best superhero film released this year, but I should probably wait till after Avengers to say that."
"7524","So just got back from #Shazam
Brilliant movie all I can say. Won't spoil anything. But.... There was one thing that bothered.

"7575","Just to quickly give my full thoughts on Shazam, now that I've had a few hours to think about it...

It's really good. Probably my favorite out of all the recent DC movies, although that's not saying too much since I haven't liked most of them."
"7576","I haven't really liked any of their movies since Man of Steel. Closest one for me was Aquaman and even then I thought it was pretty sub par, and I have no intention of ever watching it again.

I'd gladly rewatch Shazam though."

"7650","@ReginaldWoodso4 @GraceRandolph Tell that too all the people in the Dumbo theater with me, a sold out show and Shazam isn’t. Captain Marvel is even fuller. I’m not blind. And it’s the parents/teenagers on Spring Break etc right now"
"7651","BTW I love the mythological/religious undertone the DCEU is keeping, Aquaman had the Arthurian tale on screen while Shazam has the literal * ******* ** *** AKA *** ***** **** <U+2764>"
"7652","i couldn't get past the fact that shazam and billy batson felt like 2 different people, which is mainly due to a time constraint. Like, billy is billy to deal with the drama, and shazam is shazam to do the funny things, and they're like, in two completely different worlds."
"7653","I really don’t see where all this love for Shazam has come from. The movie was painfully average."
"7654","@Devindra How dark is Shazam?  My kid wants to go but I read the comic and it seemed a little much with the 7 deadly sins, etc."
"7655","Until this week I was under the impression that Shazam was a remake of the @SHAQ classic Kazam and wow I feel really dumb but also disappointed because I would love to see that remake"
"7656","Well #Shazam and #PetSematary were really good movies."
"7657","@ponysmasher SPOILERS FOR SHAZAM 

I noticed that the Superman suit was different. Was a completely new suit that you guys designed for the movie?"
"7658","@purplesockday @ShazamMovie We loved it! It’s really fun! Thank goodness! I’ve been so nervous for our boy since news of his casting."
"7659","@ShazamMovie I enjoyed the movie <U+0001F44D>"
"7660","i second this a lot"
"7661","Go see @ShazamMovie !!! Not just a great superhero movie... it’s a great movie! A lot of heart! And a great message about family! #Shazam!"
"7662","@dc_connections I feel like they are. From the very beginning, people have been clamoring for Black Adam to show up. He's part of the top 3 most used villains in Shazam's rogues gallery, and he'd be perfect for the final villain in a trilogy."
"7663","@garpike28 @JeremySimser @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie I think it still stands that merchandise being available and on store shelves weeks in advance is as bad a problem as @OriginalFunko posting pics on their social media. Either way, it’s still unavoidable and wholly unnecessary: does it really take so much energy not to be a jerk?"
"7664","@oldsaltstudios Probably not. Shazam was cathartic for me because it's so joyously silly and unashamed of itself. It might not have the same impact on a person who hasn't spent 10 years complaining about the Nolan Batman films. That being said, I could easily be convinced to watch it again . . ."
"7665","(Shazam spoilers kinda??) 
Celebrated Mason's birthday by going and seeing Shazam
Super good. Got a lot of good ""family is who you choose to love, not who you're born into"" feels from it"
"7666","can y’all believe funko spoiled shazam before it even came out"
"7667","The whole cast were spot on but Zachary Levi, Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer absolutely nailed Shazam, Billy and Freddy respectively"
"7668","This was a thoroughly good movie. Hilarious, well-written, with solid acting. — watching Shazam! Movie"
"7669","#Shazam was a really good movie, very charming and funny, but for those of you seeing it with younger kids, a lot of the 10 and unders in the theatre were scared of some parts. The 7 demons are a bit freaky, so give your kids a heads up if they are sensitive."
"7670","@dudx8 @ErikaHarlacher Thank you. The my schedule is tight and the nearest theater os an hour away. My friend and I are trying to plan a shazam / hellboy double feature."
"7671","Shazam sequels shouldn't take long to make especially with the small budgets. So yearly/18 months apart Harry Potter style is doable."
"7672","Shazam was like a more controlled Homecoming for the DCEU.

Note: I loved Homecoming."
"7673","Black Adam is the Voldemort of Shazam. He just happens to have his own prequel film first. :)"
"7674","thanks for coming to my ted talk agora to indo ver shazam bjs kkkkkkkkk"
"7675","Was one of the best DC superhero films you’ve ever seen** #Fixed #Shazam"
"7676","Shazam! Utterly brilliant, fun, feel-good DC superhero movie. Cleverly riffing on the feels of Big, The Goonies, Superman and even Power Rangers, it's gripping, funny and gloriously entertaining. This big kid loved it, and my kids too #Shazam #DC"
"7677","@JoshKidwell29 I've entered then unentered these in the past. The rules on all of their accounts/giveaways say you must be located where the theaters are. Check the rules &amp; make sure it applies. If not, don't bother. <U+0001F644>"
"7678","@NetflixUK can we have Shazam on Netflix l Think the community love it l hope you can"
"7679","What a delight it was to see @RealJohnGlover in #Shazam. Still the best guy to cast as a super villain’s father."
"7680","My wife had to run to the restroom and missed the mid-credits scene. Had a hell of a time trying to explain it to her later. #Shazam"
"7681","I was suprised by how intense #Shazam can be at times, but it strikes a great balance with all the humor. I would have been obsessed with this movie as a kid."
"7682","Just saw that Shazam is pg 13 because it's too intense and violent for young children and way to miss the point of the character, guys, good job!"
"7683","Yesss... popcorn &amp; movie time — watching Shazam! (IMAX 2D)"
"7684","Saw Shazam. Astep in the right direction for DC. It was funny, had heart, got PRETTY dark and honestly a little scary (kids were legit crying next to me), but just a bright spot in this mindset of ""we have to be dark to be taken seriously"". Hope the rest of the DCEU follows suit."
"7685","""SHAZAM!""

. . .

"". . .man, that never works."""
"7686","@WriteRobWrite19 But that movie was never going to get the widespread views like Shazam so the comparison isn't on the same level. Also, illness-based movies are a different genre than the history of disabled narratives specifically so I don't compare the two on that level."
"7687","Was not expecting Shazam to be that good of a movie. Prolly see it again"
"7688","Just saw the new Shazam movie I’ll give it a 7/10"

That was NOT cool. 

(Glad I already saw it.)"
"7701","Young justice outsiders is so good but I must take a break in watching since I’m omw to see Shazam"
"7702","Saw @ShazamMovie; it was fun, goofy, and had a lot of heart (not to mention it being a Christmas movie). Exactly what I want in my comic book films. Also, the audacity of the villain reveal in the mid-credits scene is fantastic XD"
"7703","Just watched #Shazam and I see what y'all did there in the absence of Henry Cavill you give us Ross Butler, DJ Cotrona, and Zachary Levi! Getting moms to like this movie too. <U+0001F923> Besides the eye candy, it was a great movie."
"7704","@gadotayIor I do too!! My younger brother has been obsessed w Shazam since he saw him in the injustice game so he’s very excited too lol"
"7705","Can’t believe I paid to see Shazam. For a movie boasting fun, it wasn’t really. You can’t really pull off a family movie if your cast has no chemistry and your leads lack charisma. Cringe-fest."

"7714","Someone came up to me at work today and said, “KEISHA! I saw Shazam last night and it was SO good that I thought it was a Marvel movie!” <U+0001F604> That was REALLY sweet! @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie #NerdReference"
"7715","Shazam! (7/10) A boy gains magical powers. The casting is perfect for everyone and the story moves quickly with a lot of laughs. The action has a quick pace and is satisfying. Though, the villain could have been stronger and could have better motivation. #FilmTwitter"
"7716","Just watched #Shazam #ShazamMovie it was fucking insane loved every ounce surprised the trailer didn't spoil nothing 9/10"
"7717","@UpToTASK It should be noted that he never actually has a name in the movie. So all the Shazam vs. Captain Marvel peeps can chill a little. In a way it's just like the comics were. Call him Shazam on the cover and merch, but Captain Marvel in the pages."
"7718","@UpToTASK @MTFIII Oh, I agree. he's Shazam. I like the idea that he adopts the name on his own. Or that he 'accepts it'. Though I also liked that he got all kinds of nicknames."
"7719","Shazam reminds me of the time an old man took me to an underground tunnel to show me his magic stick."
"7720","Overall the movie does everything right it utilizes the characters perfectly and Zachary Levi was born to be Shazam he absolutely kills this role and makes this movie even more enjoyable"
"7721","Billy Batson is the superhero we all needed right now &lt;3 #ShazamMovie"
"7722","@ZacharyLevi Just watched #Shazam You. Are. Awesome. That role was perfect for you!!!!!!! You're literally my favorite actor of all time! <U+0001F49C><U+0001F49C>"
"7723","Really? Was wondering if it’s worth the theater experience..."
"7724","#ShazamMovie A decent watch.  First two acts are strong; third one kinda ruined it to me - but opinions will vary.  I didn't like the DCU integration force feeding either.  Thanks for the hat tips to the obvious inspiration source material.  Sad not to see Zoltar at the carnival."
"7725","I am already hearing all the kids shouting Shazam <U+0001F602><U+0001F62D>"
"7726","@chalametsdc @SamParkerMetal Given that it comes out next February and BvS and Shazam (which came out in March and April) had SDCC trailers, I wouldn't be surprised"
"7727","Always read @kphipps3000 and @scott_tobias"
"7728","Glad I got to enjoy #Shazam before the fucking Funko toys ruined one of the best reveals as per usual."
"7729","@ZacharyLevi’s portrayal in Shazam was so darn good that my 10 year old son informed me, upon leaving the theater, that Shazam was his new favorite superhero. Zachary Levi has officially become my son’s Christopher Reeve. And that to me, is the highest compliment I can give."
"7730","@JerryOrdway @1JohnLivesay @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @ErikJLarsen @LetsTalkCM @DCComics @geoffjohns @sterlinggates @aaronlopresti Yes they do!  Extra credit biology points for you, Jerry! (I used to teach that subject).   I just found this issue at a public domain site.  The cover was the only appearance of the evil squid.  It wasn't even a part of the Capt. Marvel story."

"7735","In the theater to see #Shazam Figured I deserve a treat after the week I've had. <U+0001F609>"
"7736","Just got out of #Shazam and that might be one of my favorite superhero movies in years. Easily the best DC movie in years"

Some sad parts
Good effects"

"7747","Just saw Shazam! 9 out of fucking 10...this is so awesome!"

"7808","#Shazam was super fun, insightful, and the casting was perfect."
"7809","Yes, please!!"
"7810","@DCComicsMovie @googamp32 @nicklate93 @gavinfeng97 So even if it makes 100 million (it won't) studios only get 25 million.

Most likely, Shazam makes 60 million and if it does that the studios will only get 15 million of it back.

So honestly no biggie, domestic is where it counts and the numbers are surging."

"7813","After watching #Aquaman and #Shazam, @WarnerBrosEnt needs to bring @geoffjohns back into the fold with these films."
"7814","Shazam is 50% good movie, 50% schlock. Both entertaining for different reasons. Third act is a bit of a let down but overall it's alright."

"7818","SHAZAM! isn’t much of a superhero film, but it is a surprisingly touching exploration of family. Zachary Levi does his best Tom Hanks, but the ridiculous narrative and low-rent FX ultimately fail him. Still, manages to be a better Justice League film than, well, JUSTICE LEAGUE."

"7830","This might be one of the greatest reviews I have ever seen!"
"7831","Hey, so SHAZAM was a bonafide blast. It’s up there with WONDER WOMAN as the best of the DC superhero films of late — and it’s genuinely fun and not dire or dour."
"7832","I’m so happy Shazam! banged exactly like I thought it would."
"7833","Me and my sis are currently watching Shazam. Will be back later to give my irrelevant opinions."
"7834","@heroichollywood @easz_hostile No he's not.<U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F60E><U+0001F60E><U+0001F60E><U+0001F60E><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>. I'm glad you have a Joke to tell makes me laugh. Not happening Dywane is going to kick shazam's Ass all of the city."
"7835","@UberKryptonian It's one of the best things about it. Unlike that monstrosity that came out in 2017, Shazam is not afraid to admit it's in the DCEU and there were a lot of things that if you're a fan, you will love this"
"7836","Saw #Shazam tonight and pleasantly suprised by how good the movie was and @ZacharyLevi you were wonderful to watch <U+0001F60D>"
"7837","Saw #Shazam earlier.  It may be my favorite DC movie.  A couple things in it made me think of the George Miller Justice League that never got made."
"7838","the shazam sisters have all my love and support and i will protect them at all costs no matter what"
"7839","Shazam was pretty good. Second favorite DC movie. I throughly enjoyed it. Those last seconds were iconic, tbh. To me, at least. I laughed. #Shazam <U+0001F60A>"
"7840","DFW folks: Sean &amp; I are going to see Shazam at Alamo in Richardson at 10:15 if anyone wants to come out!"
"7841","Shazam is worthy of a rewatch"
"7842","Bro lmao when me and my bestfriend saw ross on Shazam we literally screamed <U+0001F62D>"
"7843","Scratch this. Between the Final Four games and #JusticeLeagueVsFatalFive being on @TheDCUniverse that’ll be what I watch tonigh..."
"7844","SO. Instead of seeing Shazam tomorrow I “get” to see Captain Marvel again... “woo”:"
"7845","SO. Instead of seeing Shazam tomorrow I have to see Captain Marvel again..”woohoo”"
"7846","@ZacharyLevi Hey Zachary, last wednesday we watched “Shazam” and we loved it... Pure entertainment with an splendid cast... congratulations from Brazil... I hope you have enjoyed your time in here!!!"
"7847","can we just all agree that both asher AND jack were really great in shazam"
"7848","The part in Shazam where he jumps off the building and transforms is a top tier superhero moment."
"7849","@ZacharyLevi Took my daughter to her first superhero movie - Shazam. A fun awesome family film that you did a phenomenal job in. Made me remember how much I loved Chuck years ago. I hope to see more of you in the DC Universe."
"7850","Some of y’all are about to be real mad at me but it must be said, Shazam was better than Captain Marvel."
"7851","Finally seeing Shazam tomorrow"
"7852","I just saw Shazam. 6 1/2 out of 10. My biggest problem is how they handled his mom. You’d think something like that would deeply affect you but nah he just kept going,"
"7853","Shazam is so pure and this is all I’m saying, it has:
<U+0001F518>Billy Batson pissing off cops
<U+0001F518>Corporate creeps getting eaten by demons.
<U+0001F518>A superhero who believes in Santa."
"7854","Stop comic discrimination today"
"7855","isn’t it like, a rule, that man of steel has to be somewhere in your top three?"

"7857","We're in Greeley waiting for our second shot at Shazam after the Perfume Incident, and half the diner is soaked in the fumes. I think it's a cultural cow-town thing. Like, generations of ranchers where the whole family 'fumes up for a night out <U+0001F633> Wish us luck at the cinema ..."
"7858","Shazam! Is out but I ain’t got no one to go with <U+0001F62A> I wish they allowed dogs inside theaters I’d take my dog on movie dates ALL the time <U+0001F436>"
"7859","Shazam had some refreshingly funny dialogue"
"7860","I dreamed that I was at someone's wedding and I was heavily in invested in a discussion with an old man about the movie Shazam when I realised I lost my shoes. So I spent hours to look for them. Pak cik tu kept calling me to join him back to eat and resume our amazing discussion."
"7861","Might try to go see Shazam! tonight, anyone interested?"
"7862","@ChuckWendig and I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed SHAZAM!"
"7863","@tardisrider @ComicsintheGA Did you find it? It’s listed on Amazon; contains Shazam! 1-18 and ships first week of June."
"7864","@ShazamMovie was awesome!  Probably the best of the recent DC movies :D"
"7865","alright that settles it im not seeing shazam in theaters lol"
"7866","wait the disabled character in shazam is played by an able-bodied actor??? absolutely fucking not why does this always happen"
"7867","Besides the first generic 20 minutes, #Shazam was actually pretty dope!"
"7868","@AsherFeltman @Whip_YT @BigBoiLoife @ShazamMovie @JakeW31 I am truly am sorry if a 2 second clip of a teenager/superhero doing a Fortnite dance is enough for you to not watch a great movie."
"7869","Also I just went to see shazam,,,good shit ,,,"
"7870","Watched @ShazamMovie today, I have to say that it was so fun &amp; enjoyable. Spot on w it's humor and story. Perfect for family viewing. The ""Easter Eggs"" everyone is talking about are  just ref pts to the <U+0001F30E> of the movie. Great <U+0001F37F>flick. Def recommend."
"7871","DC is finally on the rise #Shazam #DoomPatrol #Joker"
"7872","@dc_connections If hes not a part of the Shazam universe, then it's a HUGE missed opportunity.  Black Adam would push Shazam to his physical limits, where he'd actually have to fight vs using tricks."
"7873","Just finished watching the movie #Shazam with some friends.  It was a good movie, definitely liked the route they went with it"
"7874","@ZacharyLevi My grandson and I saw Shazam today. We both loved it. Total entertainment. Cant wait to see you at the Dallas comicon."
"7875","@NikksFrancisco Captain Marvel had thin motivations, but I really appreciated Shazam as a character study of Billy Batson. He didn't immediately become a hero but he was much more human and grew into a better person. Captain Marvel wasn't a bad film but it just lacked these moments."
"7876","@The_Onslaught24 Shazam is by far one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen"
"7877","(shazam is playing at our local cheap, five dollars per person theater, but cm isn’t)"
"7878","homos and gentlegays i need your help deciding which movie to see. cm will clean me out financially but i really wanna show my little sister That One Scene. shazam is playing at the cheap theater but im honestly not that interested in seeing it"
"7879","me: hey [sister] wanna go see captain marvel tomorrow?
sister: sure!
me: *checks online and learns that ticket prices for 2 people are way out of my price range*
me: ... hey [sister] wanna go see shazam tomorrow?"
"7880","This article and the replies to it are silly.
Shazam! has some pretty excellent representation in there. 
And no, they're not just minor characters either.
But creating this sense of competition feels redundant as all diversity should be celebrated and promoted."
"7881","@martamilans as Rosa was such an amazing character! She deserves all the respect #SHAZAM!"
"7882","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Seen it &amp; really enjoyed it, time to expand on other dc heroes &amp; villains in cinema,
Plus its a breath of fresh air apart from having Batman &amp; Superman all the time."

"7886","@BangtanTrends @BTS_twt Well my premium Spotify account is ready...Shazam app as well. Waiting for my ver2 &amp; 3 albums to arrive.

And the best part: No work on Thursday &amp; Friday!!<U+0001F389> Only thing I'm hoping is that my new hearing aid molds arrive before Friday."
"7887","Shazam was really good you all should go see it. Dissapointed it wasn't advertised much. Ive been reading the comic, and can be picked up right after watching as it follows after the movie. Very different tone than the rest of the films."
"7888","bout to go see shazam because, why not"
"7889","I'm getting SOFT, man. My heart used to be made of teflon, but today I teared up watching Shazam."
"7890","i have beef that i can't remember but i just really liked it overall i love feeling joy and shazam spoilers maybe i'll keep it vague when billy said ""i invited another friend"" i was so happy i'm so mad we don't have an established actor for [redacted] who could have been there"
"7891","Mini me and I have been wanting to see this!! YASSS #Shazam #shazam
#ShazamMovie"
"7892","Shazam! is brilliant. You really can make a really good and hilarious superhero film without stuffing it with forced pop culture references or going against the source material."
"7893","@RICHARDLNEWBY @dcumoviepage True. The film that SHAZAM is most similar to is The Goonies, though the Seven Deadly Sins are scarier than Clara Peller &amp; Robert Davi. Captain Marvel isn’t quite right (no fault of Levi) but this was the absolute best we could hope for with the N52 source material. Great film!"
"7894","Shazam sucked!   Santa was the best part!   
Spoke to me deeply"
"7895","@ChuckWendig I really hope DC keeps up this trajectory of fun movies like Aquaman and Shazam instead of the rest that weren't really *fun*."
"7896","@bholtongeorgia The extended version of JL is much better than the theatrical version. But Shazam was the most fun by far. The casting was great across the board."
"7897","@Osbornthenormie My expectations for the movie was it to be solid and I left the theater amazed and starstruck. The movie had heart, not to say Shazam didn't. The battles are awesome, the Skrulls are handled great, the post credits speak for themselves. Just a really fun time"
"7898","Ricky took me to a couples massage today and then we had lunch and watched Shazam and now I’m going to Cheesecake Factory with my parents"
"7899","I say this since folks want to bash Shazam based off what someone else said <U+0001F612>"
"7900","pretty sure there’s plenty of easter eggs and references during the door opening scene in SHAZAM!. Not a DC fanboi so i probably did not understand the references"
"7901","i hate how in the comments they’re doing this diversity competition thing.cant we be happy that we have multiple movies with a bunch of diversity in it"
"7902","I thought the flash and shazam kay prihas silag power <U+0001F602> my bad <U+0001F62C>"
"7903","@cxcope I’ve heard that a lot and I’m excited because Shazam is dope."
"7904","OHHH YEAHHHHH: saw Shazam last night, and it’s super fun. Loved the choices they made to adapt to the big screen, and already stoked for the next movie"
"7905","#Shazam was pretty close to the most fun superhero movie ever. Funny, charming, heartfelt, well-acted, and hopeful, I loved every minute. Even the one that broke my heart."
"7906","Wouldn’t that be swell!"
"7907","i’m seeing shazam at 6 and of legend is in it like i’ve heard i’m going to cry"
"7908","Bout to go see Shazam with my roommate. Not going in with any expectations except for I hope it doesn’t blow. Wish me luck haha"
"7909","The best part of SHAZAM is jn the beginning when Billy steals a cops cheesesteak. Antifa superhero"
"7910","From 1-5 Shazams, how many Shazams does anyone give that Shazam is in theaters?"
"7911","From 1-5 Shazams, how many Shazams does everyone give that Shazam is coming out?"
"7912","Need to watch captain marvel and shazam now."
"7913","WhErE iS tHe DiVeRsItY hErE? Lol smh at the people who discount the diversity in Shazam, this is not even including Rosa and Victor Vasquez and Djimon Hounsou who plays the Wizard Shazam"

SHAZAM

More a kids/family movie than a superhero movie, prolly to its benefit. It's a perfectly fine &amp; fun little origin story with low stakes, a few decent jokes, and some very welcome bad guy attacks &amp; S-bombs that elevate it above a PG rating

<U+2B50><U+2B50>1/2"
"7919","Sorry everyone. This delay is entirely my fault. I said ""Shazam!"" &amp; it set off a bolt of lighting. Upside tho, I seem to have some pretty dope new powers. #ORLvCOL"

"7923","Love this piece!"
"7924","@BeRealBrooo @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Yeah it was a good feeling to hear the kids be involved in the movie! I had a great time watching Shazam"
"7925","So Shazam was pretty good, super fun movie. But the villain had a glowing blue eye and that made me think of Sans the whole fucking movie"
"7926","Wow...@ShazamMovie was REALLY well done, fun, and a truly complete superhero film. Loved every minute. DC finally got ahold of their universe with this one."
"7927","I'm truly shocked how enjoyable #Shazam was. Lots of things you expect to happen yet TONS of stuff out of left field--but it all works. And even in a mixed crowd/different demographics the jokes still hit"

"7929","of 3D ever as my knowledge that I have ever seen, even as it forced letterbox on my TV screen for the IMAX sequences- but of course a theater experience is preferable and could just might find a way to see Captain Marvel even still without Brie in 3D and get that bonus in Shazam!"
"7930","Super disappointed I don't turn into a superhero when I say #SHAZAM tbh"
"7931","Also Cooper Andrews is in it and I somehow missed that but what a great surprise! #SHAZAM"
"7932","I am DEFINITELY seeing that again! That was the most fun I've had at the movies since seeing Anna and the Apocalypse! #SHAZAM"
"7933","Real talk Shazam is what Aquaman was trying to be"
"7934","If Shazam is not a new Asian dish, I am going to be highly disappointed."
"7935","One of the most perfect shot ever in a movie is the long shot in Shazam! when Dr. Sivana and the 7 deadly sins are seen having formed a circle around Shazam in the rock of eternity, and the beautiful light right there is the source of the perfection. @maxalexand Cinema x3!"
"7936","@BigBearButt Dolph was and is awesome in it as Mera's Dad, but it has even more reason to make it worth watching than that.  Oh yeah, Shazam's good too."

"7943","Zachary Levi for MVP, obviously, but the kid from IT is also in this movie, and he's fucking great. That scene where Shazam goes to buy beer (all over the marketing for this movie) is even better than you thought.

I love it.

"7945","@ZacharyLevi Wonderful film. Your chemistry with the younger cast members was perfect. My son and I absolutely loved @ShazamMovie. Thanks to you and the entire cast and crew for a fun and heartwarming evening at the theater. Looking forward to #SHAZAM2!"
"7946","I think that maybe the whole Sinbad Shazam movie thing is just that white people are somehow conflating Sinbad and Shaquille O'Neal (?how?) and are thinking of Kazaam - the 1996 movie where Shaq plays a genie that I assume was trapped in a wrecked pair of Jordan IV's or something"

"7961","Checked out #Shazam today and really dug it. It was goofy and fun while telling a good story and having some decent action beats (which is what the DC movies need right now). 

Keep doing stuff like this, AQUAMAN and WONDER WOMAN and people might start turning around on the DCEU."

"8005","Shazam! was, much like Aquaman, an enjoyable surprise. Beyond that, it didn't have much in common with Aquaman, which is really appropriate.

I'm not going to spoil anything, but if you want a good-hearted, feel-good film with a little fun and a little corniness, hope you see it."

1. Batman v Superman (Ultimate Edition)
2. Aquaman
3. Shazam!
4. Man of Steel
5. Wonder Woman
6. Justice League
7. Suicide Squad"

"8052","@marcbernardin Live action dude. Also Shazam most certainly IS the most diverse so far. Black Panther was 90% one ethnicity, and though Homecoming had diversity, it didn't have as much as Shazam."

Hopefully see Shazam if I nag my dad, after that then watch the progress of him painting my bedroom and watch more of Lord of The Rings <U+0001F60C>

"8134","Also @ShazamMovie after credits toss a lot of super shade."
"8135","Great fun movie. It hit all the notes I wanted from the comics.
But it definitely earned the PG13, if that’s a concern."
"8136","@SJWSuperman However, going by the trailers, the protagonist, his ""sidekick"", and the antagonist are all white males. If all Shazam! does is tick off a lot of diversity boxes instead of having them be fully formed characters, then it becomes problematic. Then diversity becomes tokenism. 2/2"
"8137","@SJWSuperman To be honest, I didn't see/hear his take on Aquaman. I'm assuming you're talking about his tweet about the Yahoo story. I haven't seen Shazam!, yet (going Tuesday), but I did read the article. It's great that there is a lot of diversity in the cast. 1/2"

"8166","Seeing @ShazamMovie was a somewhat pleasant experience during my Saturday night after an early shift i dragged my soul to do. But the film i must admit, had many cheesy jokes &amp; stale dialogues which almost made me yawn of boredom. But the film stayed consistent through the end"

"8171","@headgeek666 We're not even in the same realm on that one. Superman IV is just a bad movie. SHAZAM is a blast. I wouldn't compare it to the first Superman, though. Only thing that comes close to its spirit is Guardians of the Galaxy 2."

In other international markets, studios take around 40% to 50%. Shazam will have to make around $350M to make a profit. I think it's doable though."

"8253","@Stemot1978 Still can't get over the disappointment after seeing it 2 days ago. It's a comedy and a comedic character but ffs this was on the level of Thor and Guardians movies x10. Animated versions of Shazam in JLU and YJ are perfection compared to this sitcom."

Deadpool was just references, Shazam had actual bait and switch set ups and played off the tropes...While also celebrating them."

"8286","#Shazam is a fine movie. I didn’t come out questioning my existence in a depressed, dark gloomy world. It was uplifting to see the focus on what it really means to be a superhero, the journey to become that and the power of family. The humor was better than Marvel’s too."

"8381","will be watching the movie: 'Shazam!' @ Golden Village Paya Lebar Cinema today."
"8382","#Shazam was an awesome movie. It was definitely a nice surprise. The acting and comedy was spot on. @ZacharyLevi was basically playing himself and you can tell he loved it. The kids were great and their adult counterparts were perfectly cast."
"8383","#Shazam made me smile and laugh, much more than a live-action superhero movie usually does. Saw kids in the aisle over just getting excited and laughing with Shazam. Good movie and stoked for Zachary Levi knocking it out of the park <U+0001F60A>"
"8384","Watching #Shazam after listening to @GHLPodcast made it so much better! Thanks guys <U+0001F60A><U+0001F44D>"
"8385","FYI... #Shazam was incredible. I had low expectations and was Very PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!"
"8386","@TehGreatOldOne I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in Shazam."
"8387","One of the tricky lines SHAZAM walks is that it manages to feel like the movies I grew up loving in the ‘80s and ‘90s without ever pandering to nostalgia or borrowing a style. Is just...is. And it feels like it could’ve been made between 1988 and 1992 in the best way."
"8388","@spencerbennett7 Was MoS really better than Shazam? I was really hoping it would be better. Just seemed way more fun? Or were the trailers just misleading?"
"8389","Probably will watch Shazam again, what a great experience"
"8390","Very true. I enjoyed the film, but the ads are very deceiving. It’s not all light comedy and gets really dark at points."
"8391","Rafael Casal talking about body-positivity and increased inclusivity is my kink and I am not ashamed to admit it."
"8392","@mmpadellan I took my daughter to an early showing of this for her birthday two weeks ago and we loved it!! I hope you and your wife did as well..... Shazam<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"8393","I already said this but Shazam is the best thing DC has, and probably wll put out, unless WW84 is absolute heat"
"8394","#Shazam DC all time ""they got it ranking. Wonder Woman. Shazam. Superman: The Movie. Not a ranking of which is better. Which movies best fit their sources. But... As for which is better? All of them are s goddamned blast."
"8395","Someone needs to get me a screencap of Freddie and Shazam sitting on the Art Museum steps ASAP @ShazamMovie"
"8396","I think i would have to stay away from DC Extended Universe until further notice, very disappointing. #shazam"
"8397","Totally recommend Shazam! @ShazamMovie"
"8398","I'm ready to shazam the trailer and find out <U+0001F923>"
"8399","I wanna echo what @Zakiyyah6 said. 

Stop treating diversity like a clout game. Yeah Marvel has Black Panther and Captain Marvel and that's great but most of ya'll aren't saying shit about Aquaman and Shazam. It's all important diversity and it should be celebrated, do better."
"8400","@pathfinderb @Azimali95 @DCComics @ShazamMovie Not even close, but both are marvel films basically and not very good"
"8401","#Shazam was really fun! Comedy and superhero! 

Thanks for the inv @MrAwesomeZach <U+0001F601> I had fun"
"8402","Watching Shazam kind of hit me in the feels because I was a foster kid at one point too... fuck man now I'm just sitting in my chair thinking where I could have ended up if my parents didn't get me"
"8403","@emptyDir Shazam was... fine, very middle of the road but definitely a breath of fresh air for DC because it didn’t take itself seriously at all"
"8404","Went to a theatre to see Shazam, then came home and watched Bumblebee, Bumblebee was much more fun"
"8405","@ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie what a fun and refreshing movie!"
"8406","Shazam! is all it should have been and more. It's the best DCEU movie to date and one of my new favorite superhero movies. If your interest is piqued but you're on the fence because you've been burned by WB before, go see it!"
"8407","Mary will be in my personal collection"
"8408","Oh and SHAZAM! good"
"8409","#Shazam was really cute. My only really critique is how the villain and hero were introduced. Like, that whole problem could have been avoided. But overall, it was a really fun movie. I actually really liked it."
"8410","Today:

"8415","@kegkeg1234 @Jagg3rKNoT @Octane_ Did you enjoy when 7 kids were superheros and then the say shazam they are back to kids?"
"8416","actually i lied. shazam was good up to and until it cast an abeled actor to play a disabled person"
"8417","shazam was good up to and until the scene where they showed the disabled kid “becoming his best self / reaching his ultimate potential” by transforming into an abeled person"
"8418","shazam had some of the most emotional character growth i’ve seen in a superhero movie in a LONG time"
"8419","that One Emotional Scene with billy in the apartment building hurt me deep"
"8420","#ShazamMovie Holy crap that was a fantastic movie. Finally DC. Make more movies of that quality and maybe you can catch up to marvel when it comes to movies."
"8421","DC you finally made a freaking movie that was great. #Shazam is a must watch and the fact that they had credit scenes was the way to go. I can not wait to see what you guys do next cause this most definitely caught me off guard. Good job @DCComics @ShazamMovie"
"8422","@ anyone who’s seen shazam: i’m seeing a lot of good reviews for it and i was thinking of going to see it sometime but i’ve literally never watched any other dc movies, is there anything i’ll miss or does it standalone?"
"8423","@Krazy_Cat_Katy Oh yeah. It's silly in parts but it is Shazam it's supposed to be."
"8424","also, j| an FYI, there are 2 post-credit #Shazam  scenes."
"8425","#Shazam is the most fun I’ve had watching a movie in a whilllllle!

all praises to @ponysmasher for directing one of the baddest DC films out here. &amp; @FaitheHerman, you can do ALL things. i adore you! <U+2728>"

"8430","Okay. Someone make the @Shazam that picks up African lyrics and songs."
"8431","really good movie, shazam has always been one of my favorite dc heroes, and billy's character development through out the movie was great, i did have a few problems, but they were excusable, overall, i really liked it, go see it #Shazam"

"8433","Damn.....
This is powerful. Moved me to tears."
"8434","Shazam is a lot of fucking fun"
"8435","My wife and I saw Shazam today, and it was definitely the most entertaining DC movie I’ve seen in ages. @ZacharyLevi is perfect for playing a 14 year old kid, and I mean that in the absolute best way possible."
"8436","Just watched Shazam and I’m upset because it is so incredibly mediocre"
"8437","Watched Shazam. My heart started racing when Seth and Chuck were fucking superheroes. #schwartzverse"
"8438","@SMonykol @ThePretender180 @THR That’s not how it works. Shazam was scheduled for April way before Endgame decided to pull an Infinity War and move up. Based off your logic every movie in April should be canceled or moved. Theaters have a business to run."
"8439","@SMonykol @ThePretender180 @THR That’s not how it works. They scheduled Shazam for April way before Endgame decided to pull an Inf"
"8440","#Shazam was dope. Kid friendly funny action pack good time. Worth the money. Excited what they have to follow up."
"8441","Shazam balances heavy and light-heartedness well. Probably not enough to save the DC extended universe from prior bad movies."
"8442","@IncSpaghetti @ShazamMovie Decent movie, terrible script. Set your expectations low and you will enjoy it more!"
"8443","Y’all go see #Shazam it’s great! I loved all the young actors. So cute!"
"8444","Shazam is a light comedy , beautifully directed and superbly dilevered by the actors . This movie won't bore you till the end . @ZacharyLevi you were on fire. #AsherAngel was born for this role.  #freddy is the foundation. #Shazam #DCUNIVERSE"
"8445","Despite having the wisdom of Solomon, all of the #Shazam kids share a single brain cell, and I love them for it"
"8446","Someone gave me a free ticket to #Shazam and I'm so happy I didn't pay to watch this. While viewing, I realized that ""fun"" and ""good"" are not synonymous; this film is the former, not the latter."
"8447","Just finished watching Shazam! And I super enjoyed the movie. <U+0001F60D> 
Was waaaayy over the moon seeing  @RossButler in the movie! <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"8448","Just saw @ShazamMovie with a couple friends.  @ZacharyLevi  my friends and I loved it.  I laughed way more than them, probably anyone in the theater, to be honest.  Then again, I am a DC comics girl, even though Batman was always my favorite.  <U+0001F92A>"
"8449","Watched earlier...fun movie! Nice to actually enjoy another recent DC movie. — watching Shazam! Movie"
"8450","Still can't believe I paid money to see pet sematary when I could have just seen Shazam again"
"8451","Shazam! was really good. I think I enjoyed it more than other people (based on audience reaction) because of how much I know of the character and the history. It’s a weird world and I loved all the Easter eggs that they had for C.C. Beck and Faucett Publications. @ShazamMovie"
"8452","Shazam Is an 8.6/10

This film was a blast. Billy Batsons arc is great and as soon as Zachary Levi comes on screen, the film just gets better and better. The score was decent, typical action movie stuff. Villain was probably the weakest link..."

Shazam<U+26A1> is an 8.6/10"

"8455","@Expanseshill Freddy idolizes heroes especially Superman. He also knows Shazam who will likely get into contact with Superman himself. Shazam was always set to meet Freddy in the cafeteria earlier in the film so the payoff is that Shazam brings Superman in and makes Freddy look super cool."
"8456","I learned 2 things tonight:
1. @ShazamMovie is a really good movie
2. Blazin’ sauce from @BWWings is really hot. Ate 5 wings"
"8457","@ZacharyLevi your enthusiasm and gratitude for being an actor and especially for Shazam is very inspirational. You’re the kind of actor I want to be. Thanks for the inspiration."
"8458","Shazam is a crazy movie. Just 2 hours of Zachary Levi staring at the screen. No words. Dont know whether to be impressed or terrified."
"8459","@SolidSapphire18 @Diction You are forgetting Aquaman and Shazam...whos villains were lame : /"

"8464","Go see shazam now that it's actually out, you'll love it"
"8465","Okay, so I just saw Shazam. I was hoping that it would at least be decent, and let me tell you it was surprisingly good. It was a very fun movie overall with some really meaningful moments. It definitely wasn’t the best movie ever, but it was good and I’d rewatch it."
"8466","@Diction Big Jason Mamoa fan so I’m interested in Aquaman, but Shazam as a concept I’m just.......ehh."
"8467","Btw the popcorn dude judged SUPER hard because of the amount of endgame and Shazam promotional shit I bought."

"8478","@MrZMovies @RobW720 I guess. They are willing to try anything to get a hit. Shazam shifts to a lower age but is decent. Too much studio control."

"8481","Shazam was pretty good. That ending was fucking great. Radical movie."

@DCComics I love you guys"
"8488","@thefilmcynic The two strip club jokes would probably go right over his head. I had a 5-6 year old girl in front of me at my showing and the boardroom definitely scared her but she was hooting and hollering whenever Shazam was on screen and lost her mind in the final act"

"8499","@Sydney_3G1C @IGN Well both are our own opinions so lets just leave it like you preferred CM and I preferred Shazam"
"8500","So I saw Shazam!

And it was awesome. Amazing. it's the sort of beautiful superhero film that makes you remember why you love the genre.

I also don't understand why anyone would compare it to Captain Marvel. They aren't really similar in...any way whatsoever."
"8501","OK I REALLY LIKED SHAZAM!! I stand by my statement that if I was a kid this would be my favorite film. I think this should have came out in December instead of Aquaman to fit the season. It was a really charming and funny movie and I would watch it again for sure. 9/10."
"8502","ok but is legend actually in shazam??  i haven’t heard much about it now"
"8503","Maybe #Shazam spoiler, but I'm SO PROUD that the movie did THAT with the kids."

The Dabbing part is gone"
"8513","Okay so #Shazam was pretty cool.
Still I don´t the ""LOL so funny! just like marvel! memes!"" thing, almost the entire movie is Billy being sad, lonely and miserable until things get better.

Still, good movie."

"8521","It’s no competition. It’s an achievement for Shazam to be THIS diverse. And the media are celebrating its achievement. Just how they praised Black Panther for its diverse cast. MCU shills hypocrisy is just pathetic to see."

"8568","@carlfreemerman @IGN I always knew it would do more than 40, not a known hero but it looked like fun. Coincidentally I just got out of seeing Us and there were a ton of kids walking around with Shazam schwag. Hoping to see it before it’s out of the theatre."
"8569","Oh yeah, fuck lmao. Time/age is actually an issue if they are to prolong in making the sequel"
"8570","So I finished watching #Shazam 2 hours ago and I liked the movie. Easily my favorite DCEU movie. The cast does such a good job and there are only some small problems I have with the movie but the plot pacing is good and it gets its point across. Very enjoyable! <U+0001F60A>"
"8571","@ShazamMovie was great! So many good jokes! Just a well planned and executed movie. Would definitely watch again"
"8572","@ZacharyLevi Just saw Shazam and have to agree that it is a WINNER. Congratulations on a movie that balances everything perfectly. #AllhailthManchildKing ##Saymyname"
"8573","I just came back from #Shazam what is happening?!?!"
"8574","I wish I could be like Shazam, just say that one words and *poof*"
"8575","Go Ahead, Flag it off @ponysmasher"
"8576","Saw Shazam 10/10. Perfect family movie.  Wanna play him in injustice now"
"8577","Watched Shazam and all I have to say is ..."
"8578","Darla said in the movie that he wanted to be buff though"
"8579","@BrothersInLight I can't get into SHAZAM.  I just can't.  I think Gnort has more promise than him."
"8580","""Shazam"" is a really fun family comedy that gets bogged down with dull superhero action scenes and a villain, that admittedly they tried to flesh out, but just isn't that interesting to be a menace. Still, the cast was charming and had a lot of great laughs so worth checking out."
"8581","Well Shazam was good. Maybe not as good as I’d heard, but still a good time at the theater. It’s also the type of movie I suspect will age very well on future viewings."
"8582","Had to brake the news to my kids that @jimmyfallon isn’t Shazam. Had to google and show them that it’s @ZacharyLevi <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> they were so disappointed <U+0001F602>"
"8583","I think Shazam! does what Marvel has done right so many times. Rather than make a super hero movie, they made a fun coming of age buddy comedy that happens to have a super hero as the protagonist, and it worked."
"8584","Time to see #Shazam. Sounds pretty cool. Review after."
"8585","@ponysmasher did you use your black magic camera to shoot any scenes in #Shazam? I’ve always admired how resourceful you are as a director!"
"8586","@slines @Shazam You should see the movie.  It is genuinely adorable and funny. It has a great narrative.  All about family."
"8587","#Shazam wasn't as kid friendly as I was hoping it would be. Excited to see the characters in the future though."
"8588","The #ShazamMovie was fantastic! Perfect mix of comedy/action/seriousness. We all absolutely loved it. That @ZacharyLevi guy is going to be a huge star!"
"8589","Shazam was great. It didn't blow me away, but overall I'd call it a pretty dang good time. Talking superhero movies, I'm not sure if I'd call it Homecoming or Guardians funny, but still great."
"8590","@RegalMovies My question: will @ShazamMovie be number one in the box office?   Magic 8 ball answers: Most Definitely."
"8591","Welp. I'm sick on bed. I'm letting my brothers watch Shazam without me.

I'd get even sicker if I went with them. I'm freezing all over."
"8592","@ShazamMovie #SHAZAM This is a Fantastic movie! My Son and I Loved it. He’s all into Shazam now."
"8593","This is a small #SHAZAM thing, but I was glad to see a foster home that was actually full of positivity and not a hotbed of neglect and verbal and physical abuse"
"8594","#Shazam was awesome, way more serious then I expected but still funny &amp; visually cool. I think it was a solid modern version of the hero. Also that after credit scene <U+0001F923>
I am however super disappointed that I'm the only one in the theater that laughed at hadouken. Unacceptable."
"8595","In the #Shazam movie the IDS Tower (yes that one) makes an appearance and Billy Baston is said to be from Zumbrota MN (a nod to original cartoonist CC Beck's hometown) and did you know Shazam was originally created as Captain Marvel at Fawcett Publications in Robbinsdale in 1939?"
"8596","Just saw Shazam! and it was fantastic! Highly recommend!!!!"
"8597","So Shazam!

Yeah, it wasn't for me.

I mean, it's alright.  It will find an audience.  I'm just not it. 

Mark Strong's good.  The family is good.  

Problem is, I'm not a fan of the two lead characters.  Bigger problem is, we spend most of the movie with them."
"8598","They got it right with Aquaman and wonder woman let’s see if it continues"
"8599","@thatgrltrish 4.75/5 
Primarily Comedy but with others genres mixed in 
Everyone is great in it but special props to Zachary, Asher and Jack 
Some deadpool type meta elements
Can already say it is immensely rewatchable

"8611","#Shazam went with my husband and 5 yr old stepson and we all loved it!! @ZacharyLevi was awesome, so was the rest of the cast!"
"8612","I just say the real Captain Marvel movie @ShazamMovie @WarnerBrosEnt What an amazing film. Loved Shazam."
"8613","@Drizsle Then you should definitely drop by the theater and watch Shazam. It will be a great time and for the sound of your working schedule, the film will give you a much deserve relaxing time."
"8614","@Drizsle Wow I see.

Well, Shazam is definitely a great time at the movies. Like I'm pretty sure you'll laugh a lot. But the film isn't all about that, it also has a great message about family, and love ones. It's also kinda spooky at times, not much action though but a lot of heart."
"8615","@AnthonyCarraro1 Really? Well I guess you're more hardcore Marvel fan than me then. It is hard to me to choose a rank when it comes to DC as well. But I'm certain of my number one as of now and that's Shazam."
"8616","I can say with certainty how true it is that every person is capable of having powers, even if they technically aren't ""super"""
"8617","Shazam was surprisingly really good. Fresh take on the superhero genre and pretty funny."
"8618","@PNemiroff @DoNatoBomb Hi perry having fun always went and seen shazam at the pix theater six dollar mantine here in Albany,OR the theater is a 1920s building becoming a movie theater in the 40s love the movie and the two main characters ark of family one leads to good one not so good"
"8619","Man, #Shazam was beautiful! I wasn’t expecting anything from it but ended up on the verge of tears twice or thrice (is this even an actual word?).
I know that’s an unpopular opinion amongst 50% of you but I don’t care. I loved it."
"8620","@FaZeKay Go to the movies and see Shazam really good movie"
"8621","@THEBRYANHITCH I much prefer Jerry Ordway's back story on how Billy's parents are connected with Theo Adam and the world of Shazam than this overly simplistic take on Billy's back story."

"8626","Pleasantly surprised by Shazam!"
"8627","Shazam was not terrible. Pleasantly entertaining. Literally “BIG” with superpowers, even had the piano dig bit in there"
"8628","Shazam was a fun movie with a lot of style, but still super cliche and has a lot of problems still. However, it was the most competent and fun DCEU movie made so far. I recommend seeing it more than Aquaman."
"8629","#Shazam was so good! I’m really impressed by it!"
"8630","I haven't seen Shazam yet (and never once saw a trailer for it, despite going to the movies every week) but I played through the Lego Villains level twice for all the achievements. My idea of the plot is that a dude falls out of the sky and lands in a mall, where he homages BIG."
"8631","No Shazam tweets? Is it even worth $5 tuesdays at @AMCTheatres ?"
"8632","@SUP3R_CH31F @IGN DC by far. Marvel fans have nothing to be bitter about. As a fan who favors Marvel, I just want DC to get to their level. I hope Shazam is like that for me. Seeing it Monday."

"8645","I can't believe **** ***** is in a blockbuster movie. #Shazam"
"8646","I feel that both #CaptainMarvel and #Shazam are the Antz and A Bugs Life Of this year."
"8647","Shazam is what the DCU needed. 

Really good."
"8648","Shazam is such a happy film many people will really relate to and make kids feel really happy!

Welp, time to crush their hopes and dreams with Endgame in a couple of weeks."

"8652","@ZacharyLevi about to see Shazam! So stoked! One of my fav heroes played by one of my fav actors! Wisdom of Solomon,  Strength of Hercules, Stamina of Atlas, Power of Zeus, Courage of Achilles and the Speed of Mercury! SHAZAM!!"
"8653","okay but dc was my first love and seeing shazam made me and 13 year old julia so so happy"
"8654","@MWDanvers I liked Identify Crisis, but it only works if Light is a recurring bumbler despite his power, and then you get the reveal. Too much for a single movie

And given how badly it could go, despite loving Shazam, I don’t trust the Snyder-verse to handle it correctly."
"8655","Shazam was actually really good and touching, whoever created that trailer should lose their job"
"8656","@Grimphantom_Inc @CalicoBggs It's true that most non-comics readers would probably only know of Shazam from the Clash episode of Justice League. Was Carol or any of the other Marvel Caps in any of the Avengers cartoons, before the current Marvel Phase?"
"8657","Watched Shazam second time today, this time in Imax. This movie is full of life and heart. It never felt like second time. Loved it more and definitely going for third round. @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie"
"8658","Saw Shazam, it was not a good movie.  There were parts I liked but it was really stupid at certain points.  The villain was good and there were parts of the movie I liked but it was just bad, the plot got really stupid."
"8659","@SauronsBANE Apparently it's well established in the film why the Wizard *really* chooses Billy. He basically takes a leap of a faith. 

I haven't seen Shazam but many people are saying that. So, there's your answer I guess."

"8665","Finally watched Aquaman tonight and loved it as well, DC, if you keep this up I might become a fan again! Actually, here is an idea, keep Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam and cut everything else and you have the start of an amazing shared universe. ;)"

"8671","Shazam was pretty sweet, some asshole kept talking on the phone and threw chewed up sourpatch kids at me for telling him to shut up tho so that was rude. The movie itself was still really good would recommend"

"8749","We loved @ShazamMovie! Funny, entertaining, action-packed.  @ZacharyLevi played the part well."
"8750","hyyh/bu bts shazam au where hoseok is billy batson and the other members are the family he found and chooses to be with"
"8751","Shazam is basically the OC but with super heroes so yeah, 10/10"
"8752","Just got out of Shazam, really enjoyed the movie, love the route they took with this DC film, gave me a Marvel vibe. Hope they take this tone with more upcoming DC films. 8.5/10"
"8753","Lets see what the whole deal about SHAZAM! is about <U+0001F617><U+0001F617><U+0001F619><U+0001F619>"
"8754","3 things about #Shazam
- Why make a movie set during Christmas time and release it in April? 
- Why is every other DC movie set in fictional cities like Gotham and Metropolis, but this one is in Philly?
- Somehow it was still too dark and creepy. DC just can’t help themselves."
"8755","#Shazam barely exceeded my extremely low expectations. I gave it a chance, but DC just doesn’t make very good movies."
"8756","I may or may not have shrieked Seth Cohen in a movie theatre tonight... #Shazam fucking rocks! Everyone, go see it!"
"8757","@ccasas07 This lady wanted a Shazam comic after leaving hers in the auditorium and not wanting to go back to get hers and getting mad because I wouldn’t give her another lol"
"8758","@tonyisontwtr @Shazam ""Excuse me while I kiss this guy"""
"8759","Absolutely loved Shazam, much to my surprise."
"8760","Absolutely loved Shazam, much to my surprise. #Shazam"
"8761","Oh my God Shazam is actually a really good movie"
"8762","So I saw #Shazam today, and it was as spectacular as everyone's been saying, I loved it so much that I wish that I could see it again"
"8763","Just ate an entire large popcorn at the movie theater watching Shazam! Was so fun! @kylevogt didn’t judge me! It’s a Super fun kids movie! Reminded me of the feeling I got watching Jumanji. Ya, I like kids movies and movies like the Fountain and Shape of Water. Because fun!"
"8764","Watched a movie with my dad two straight days: Shazam and Pet Sematary // wuz gud <U+2661>"
"8765","Shazam is great.
@ponysmasher proves that he knows what he’s doing behind the camera.
But, unlike previous films where the story was an excuse for jump scares, the story and characters were the driving force of the film."
"8766","I saw @ShazamMovie on Friday (in @IMAX, obviously <U+0001F917>) and totally loved it! It's funny, witty, has an amazing @ZacharyLevi basically playing all of us when we were young as well as outstanding young actors and actresses. #Shazam"
"8767","Damn guys you didn’t have to go so hard on #Shazam it was great! 8/10 would watch again in theaters"
"8768","Add me to the shazam spoiler chat"
"8769","Not to be that person, and I know people are still upset with how things turned out post-JL, but can y'all not spoil that one scene from Shazam for the people who haven't seen it? Because I'm seeing it on my timeline, and just...idk. It's just not right to me."
"8770","Wait are they fucking around with the S design??? FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUU"
"8771","@PrimeVideo Just watched Infinity War... again... and I'll be going to the movies tomorrow to see Shazam. =D"
"8772","#Shazam was fucking awesome 10/10 no doubt and you're gonna laugh you're was off. DC has defiantly turned the table when it comes to movies."
"8773","Shazam was good!

Overall a fun superhero movie!  has a few DC-DAAAAAAAAARK! fingerprints on it here and there, and the 3D version is too dark in spots.  Also our projector wasn't well aligned, so it might be that."
"8774","@ShazamMovie I just saw it and it was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. Fight me, cucks"
"8775","#SHAZAM finally...an entertaining and fun #DCU film for us to enjoy!  Also...i want these #FunkoPops"
"8776","Yes finally watched @ShazamMovie .. full ride movie you guys nailed it.. especially @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel ... laughed till end .. thank you @ponysmasher @warnerbrosindia"
"8777","I can’t wait to meet @ZacharyLevi in Boston this summer and get him to autograph my Shazam Pop! Awesome job in the movie man. It was so much fun to watch"
"8778","Just saw Shazam! 

No spoilers, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It wasn’t perfect, but it did a lot of things I really like. I would recommend it!"
"8779","I know it’s too early to say this since I just saw it like 10 seconds ago but I’m gonna say it anyway: #Shazam is my new favorite DC movie because goddamn that movie was the shit!! It’s a DC movie that feels like a Marvel but I mean in that in the absolute BEST way!"
"8780","*How #Shazam added to the recent roll of amazing and amazingly diverse superhero movies

Fixed it for you guys <U+0001F919><U+0001F3FE> you’re welcome"
"8781","SHAZAM! is the best argument that Zack Snyder should be kept as far away from DC movies as possible. It's fun, but it can also get really heartfelt when it wants to, and as a result, it has more depth than any Snyderverse film."
"8782","@Sharito742 Alright @katiepajamas, we’re going to see Shazam soon!"
"8783","Got to meet the @KindaFunnyVids crew and got to see Shazam sounds like a perfect day to me"
"8784","#Shazam was super fun! Definitely at the top of my DC movie list along with Wonder Woman."
"8785","Spent the day with Tommy Owen. Finally had his birthday dinner at Society and we were treated like royalty. So much food, highly recommend! Then to see Shazam."
"8786","@thisislijoe I didn’t see it when I went to go see Shazam though. What did you think of the film btw?"
"8787","If you wanna listen to YouTube and close the app, Shazam a song, click the YouTube video for the song, type in whatever you'd like to view in the search bar and exit the app, swipe up and play!"
"8788","Not only is Shazam a super fun time at the movies, there's a broken escalator in the subway, so it's #TTC accurate."
"8789","Seeing lots of good reviews about Shazam <U+263A><U+FE0F>
I’d completely sworn off watching superhero movies at the cinema because of the repetitiveness but I’m definitely going to see this one and in 3D too!"
"8790","Michael and i are seeing shazam in the morning and im so excited <U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A>"
"8791","@Zakiyyah6 ...... in Shazam in the marketing. Choosing to focus exclusively on Freddie and Billy for the marketing campaign. They seem reluctant to make any type of political statement, at least when it comes to diversity."
"8792","Jack Dylan Grazer, who is so great as Eddie in #It, is also so great in #Shazam. That kid's the real deal."
"8793","@Mallam_OG @UbiZubayr which of you will like the privilege of the honor of taking their broke friend( me) to see Shazam?"
"8794","@rustymarcum @ShazamMovie The movie is great! Just not geared for little kids is all."
"8795","I saw Us and Shazam to try to help with the sads today. Shazam is good, dumb fun."
"8796","@LostOnTheFringe Ohhh he was my FAV in that movie. I didn’t realize he was in Shazam too."
"8797","@satinephoenix @kylevogt Movies are supposed to be fun! I am looking forward to Shazam, which is a change for DCU movies and me."
"8798","Shazam was fun and funny and made me want to be a foster mom suuuuuper bad"
"8799","Wait...wasn’t “Shazam” the name of the film that thousands of people falsely remembered seeing even though it didn’t exist?"
"8800","Shazam was absolute <U+0001F525>. It really is the palate cleanser I need before Endgame."
"8801","Yeah. That cameo in Shazam is a slap in the face. Fuck that movie and the tribalists assclowns who are now championing it."
"8802","So Shazam was good but let’s be perfectly honest, Marvel has a stranglehold on DC when it comes to movies."
"8803","okay so y'all probably already know that this au basically is from that shazam movie lmao im so not creative im just gonna kms"
"8804","idk who needed to hear this but ross butler in shazam is soooo fine"
"8805","There’s both a STREET FIGHTER and a MORTAL KOMBAT joke in SHAZAM! that made me laugh super hard. Very fun movie. #Shazam"
"8806","didn't expect to see ross butler in shazam but here we are. here we are"
"8807","@JimJarmuschHair I took it that, as Shazam, Billy is able to drop his defensive posturing and be the kid he was never able to be/has had to steel himself against being... I do wish they were a *little* more recognizably the same character but it worked for me on that level."
"8808","Saw #Shazam tonight. Great movie! Hope everyone goes out to see it! @ZacharyLevi was perfect!! Thank you @DCComics"
"8809","So what did I think about Shazam:

Great movie. Funny as hell. Lot of heart. Kinda like the similarities between the hero and villain. Zachary Levi was great as Shazam, and Freddy was awesome!

I give it a 10/10"
"8810","How is it possible that Batman and Superman are the 2 most iconic DC characters but they’re the ones whose movies suck the most? Cuz with Wonder Woman, Aquaman and #Shazam I don’t think I need a new Batman or Superman movie in my life for at least a while."
"8811","@ajtm82 @zeta_mecha @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Yes, that’s the story. Elvis was a big fan of Cap Jr, and he emulated the hairstyle and copied the cape for his Vegas shows in his later career."
"8812","One can only hope Henry Cavill is watching #ShazamMovie and getting his pitch to @WarnerBrosEnt ready."
"8813","@queenmadalena me sitting in the theatre already envisioning a sequel where one of the shazam fam goes rogue and the others have to bring them Back To The Light: this is a cinematic masterpiece"
"8814","@queenmadalena I KNOWWWWWW I CANNOT WAITTTTT and he's gonna like sadly say 'shazam' and turn back into his kid form and start crying and they are going to group hug him MY GOD (CHEFS KISS)"
"8815","#Shazam was such a fun movie. Definitely recommend."
"8816","Just seen the movie “Shazam”, that’s about to be the new phrase for a couple of weeks"
"8817","I don’t think I’m ever gonna be able to listen to Eye of the Tiger without hearing “Hands! Lightning from my hands! Lightning from my hands!” ever again. #Shazam @ZacharyLevi"
"8818","I think I'm most thrilled that #Shazam takes place in my home town of #Philadelphia .  

Waiting for the second end credit scene..."
"8819","Shazam! is an awesome movie, but the best part was a three year old narrated the entire movie scene-for-scene beside me until I had a pounding headache. If I ever lose my ability to see I'll just sit beside him again. But seriously a good movie lol!"
"8820","“Go web. Fly. Up, up, and away web. Shazam. Go! Go! Go web go! “"
"8821","Nonood na ng SHAZAM! later hahaha time to geek out nanaman sa cinema and pretend to know everything."
"8822","Shazam is pretty great. The end didn't entirely do it for me, but an otherwise enjoyable experience."
"8823","@NonTrotski @GamesRadar Diversity, representation, values, love, family - that's #Shazam! Go watch now. It's <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FD>"

"8826","Shazam was by far the best DC movie and no one can’t change my mind"
"8827","Shazam: +2. It's a little predictable, but it's fun and funny enough to make it more than worth your while (mostly due to the endless charm of Zachary Levi)."
"8828","ross butler was in shazam and then a commercial beforehand had charles melton two reggies in one movie visit"
"8829","@ChuckVStheMovie Question: do the pre-releases count toward the opening weekend projections? #Shazam"
"8830","@ChuckVStheMovie Seeing #ShazamMovie today after work! I’m so excited <U+0001F60A>"
"8831","@MandragoraHM The 3.3 Million #Shazam made on March 23rd does not. The 5.9 Million it made on April 4th does!"
"8832","@MandragoraHM The March 23rd pre-release where #Shazam made 3.3 Million, which by the way was better then #Aquaman pre-release of 2.9 million, does not count. April 4th pre-release of 5.9 million does!"
"8833","Shazam was actually a funny ass movie <U+0001F923>"
"8834","Just shaw #SHAZAM and omg. SO. GOOD. 
@ZacharyLevi can like, get it."
"8835","#SpoilerAlert Shazam was great but I be the sequel is called either Caped Power Rangers or Orphaned Avengers."
"8836","#SpoilerAlert Shazam was great but I bet the sequel is called either Caped Power Rangers or Orphaned Avengers."
"8837","Me and my family just watched #Shazam  in español. They totally loved it. Awesome to see my nephew and other little kids yell SHAZAM! while leaving the theater. @ZacharyLevi you sound pretty good en español <U+0001F609>@ponysmasher thanks for this amazing experience!!"
"8838","just got out of #Shazam
loved the family aspect &amp; the light hearted comedy was on point! i left the theatre wanting more. 9/10"
"8839","i feel like im cheating on the MCU, but shazam is ranked pretty high on my superhero list"
"8840","SHAZAM! Good movie. Fun and just a good story. #SHAZAM"
"8841","I have nothing against John Williams theme. It was great and nostalgic, and personally I love it. But I prefer something has already been established in this cinematic universe for that matter. #Shazam #ManofSteel"
"8842","I have nothing against John Williams theme. It was great and nostalgic, and personally I love it. But I prefer something that has already been established in this cinematic universe for that matter. #Shazam #ManofSteel"
"8843","Wow.  Seriously I never notice about it."
"8844","The Shazam cosplays are gonna be so dope."
"8845","I just saw Shazam and I’ve got some questions about neck prosthetics."
"8846","Talked my husband into taking me to see @ShazamMovie tonight. He and I both absolutely loved it! @ZacharyLevi here's hoping for a sequel!"
"8847","@mockinghyun ga semua, and yes shazam masuk justice league.. he’s one of the founding members"
"8848","@JasonDemeter92 The best part was the last shot of the kid in the car looking at the family approaching him and he just whispers “Shazam....”"
"8849","Shazam was fantastic. The people behind me who kept repeating the funnier lines out loud and then laughing uproariously were not."
"8850","Anyways, I don't get to see many movies since we had our daughter, so I'm really glad Shazam was so good. Hope it's a sign of what's to come with DC."
"8851","Captain Marvel will surpass Aguaman's box office gross (most succesfull DCEU movie) by next week hth <U+0001F44D>"
"8852","Well we enjoyed that a lot! I expected to like it, but I liked it even more than I thought <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC> #Shazam"
"8853","I thought it was some kind of infomercial towel <U+0001F9D0>"
"8854","I’m definitely going to see Shazam tomorrow tho."
"8855","@MistahMahvel Dude one of my favorite Shazam comics and my first one that my dad showed me. After rereading it when I got older, it showed what kind of a hero he is. He’s the most human hero."
"8856","#Shazam was a really amazing movie and I had a great time. I wonder if Black Adam is going to be in the next one <U+0001F921>"
"8857","I just saw Shazam and it’s an amazing movie I got to say. I think my favorite character in the movie is Henry Cavill @ZacharyLevi"
"8858","I’m a life long comic fan. #Shazam is easily a top ten DC character for me. Always will be So trust me when I say this: you people *need* to get over the #CapitanaMarvel thing. His name is Shazam now. Deal with it. I don’t know how on earth something like that could bother you."
"8859","Hot take: #Shazam has issues with his parents/family. So does every DC super hero. Only difference is they kicked ass and he didn’t."
"8860","Omg #Shazam was so unexpectedly good! A fantastic tone, GREAT performances (especially Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddie, the best acting in a kid of that age I think I’ve ever seen), surprisingly dark moments... A foster child superhero? A foster family superhero team? MORE PLEASE"
"8861","Ok Doom Patrol and Shazam! And I’m starting The Tick s2 next. If everything has to be capes im thankful for these"
"8862","Just saw this with the boys tonight. Consensus: CUTE!!! #WeWantBlackAdamNext"
"8863","Appropriately so."
"8864","I heard this raw ass song on the radio this morning but I was hungover and didn’t appreciate until now. Thank you Shazam for saving that shit<U+0001F4AF>"
"8865","So my takeaway from Shazam is that no one in Philadelphia knows how to drive."
"8866","Looking forward to seeing this. #ShazamMovie . Hope it’s way better than #PetSematarymovie , which I saw today, which blew."
"8867","In shazam Dr. Sivana catches shazam's punch. This is a reference to the comics where both characters have hands. Pretty neat huh?"
"8868","Totally agree..."
"8869","Shazam was great! It had some flaws, villain was kinda bland (but I give it a pass for origin stories because the focus is the hero, some origins are as simple as taking down a common thug) and the message about family could've been more enforced by overall, super enjoyable!"
"8870","#Shazam was even more delightful than I expected and my bar was set high. @ZacharyLevi is always flawlessly adorkable and my favorite."
"8871","@lenguy4 @IGN Captain Marvel was exactly as mediocre as I expected it would be. I don't hate it, but I honestly think comparing it in quality to Shazam is an insult to good filmmaking. Shazam is better directed, better shot, better composed, and better scripted from the opening shot."
"8872","Shazam spoilers//

This mom is a bitch what the fucky sorry idk man"
"8873","Shazam spoilers //

Who the fuck Tylers a person they know get beat up like I know they aren’t actually sibling but that girl is almost in college she couldn’t defend her foster brother getting beat up"
"8874","@KaitSnod Some of the most successful things are very similar to established things. Ben 10 is literally just Dial H For Hero and Shazam. It’s all good as long as you bring something unique about you to it!"
"8875","I usually try to be courteous and not post spoilers but..

when Shazam **** **** and **** *** **  *** **** ****  then  ******* **"
"8876","I was going to go see Shazam this evening but we are now beyond suspicion I picked up a cold this week.  So I'm going to do the adult thing, Drink a ton o water, take a sleep aid and go to bed meow.  Maybe Sunday after swinging by my CPA and bite the bullet."
"8877","#Shazam is pretty good. Not my favorite superhero movie, but it might be DC's most rounded out film of their current batch. Great cast, awesome effects, engaging action, and plenty of well-timed laughs."
"8878","DC finally got it right with Shazam!!"
"8879","Shazam was really cute and really fun!! Dc is finally starting to make some good movies"
"8880","@jackdgrazer I watched Shazam so I sure did have an amazing day"
"8881","It's official: @ShazamMovie is my new favorite Christmas movie. Need that in Blu-Ray before Christmas so I can begin a new #ChristmasTradition."
"8882","Shazam is the best movie with Captain Marvel in it ever at least until Avengers: Endgame comes out"
"8883","@justindoublem Just saw Shazam and it’s pretty great / different too!"
"8884","Do not open the gif for some no-context Shazam content"
"8885","Shazam was one of the most positive, affirming movies I’ve ever seen as a superhero fan. It’s sweet and funny and GOOD, and I don’t just say that to mean well-made. It’s just GOOD. My god does it so perfectly outline all of the reasons I will always love superheroes."

"8893","The hadouken Street Fighter, and Fatality Mortal Kombat references in #Shazam was cool haha."

"8895","I'm really about to see a horror film and then SHAZAM..."
"8896","Honestly, the Shazam movie was great!! I friggin loved it. Normally heroes movies give anxiety with the loud sounds and fighting scenes but this one didn't, at least not in spanish (maybe the sound is not that loud with the dub)."
"8897","This joke only really works if you know the exact language of the Shazam tweet integration but also Google the Hanatarash bulldozer gig if you don’t already know"
"8898","@TheNazzaro Arrange in decreasing order of awesomeness:
Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Justice League, Shazam"
"8899","I realize that @ShazamMovie has recieved great acclaim upon its release, but I can't help but wish the poster was better. It looks very bland and corporate with a touch of evil in that stupid smirk. It says, to me at least, ""We know you'll see it no matter what."""
"8900","@arka2027 @Expanseshill Having finally seen #SHAZAM there is nothing in any Marvel movie, Hell in any mainstream Comic Book Movie like the boardroom scene. People die, superheroes bleed. Superman is going to have plenty of darkness (both internal &amp; external) to face in his next film."
"8901","@NewTSage That may be true, but they are tied with a lot more DC Films now. I will definitely say. I don't think #Aquaman &amp; #Shazam would have near as much impact if we didn't know the world before their arrival &amp; Snyder's Superman hadn't paved the way."
"8902","@ponysmasher Good job! Loved it! Keep it up! #directing #DCU #DCFilms #ShazamMovie"

"8904","Just saw #ShazamMovie and give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. Told a great story and was super fun. The only thing that felt missing was a score. I know I’m weird. Good job @ZacharyLevi @DCComics and @WarnerBrosEnt"
"8905","@thranduin1 Wonder Woman, Shazam, Aquaman, anything else, Justice League."
"8906","It's not just Shazam though. @OriginalFunko, for example, also posted a competition to win spoilery How To Train Your Dragon 3 Pops before the film was even out. It's infuriating!"
"8907","Bloody glad I saw #Shazam as fast as I did, because the amount of spoilers I'm seeing everywhere is crazy. It's not even from fans, it's from companys and film magazines! Giving away the post credit sequence, the chance to win spoilery Pops. What the hell, guys?"
"8908","How many fking super heroes out there? Because I really thought #Shazam was an app to find songs. 
I can’t fking keep up!!"
"8909","Yo I watched Shazam and yea,
I really like it."
"8910","Shit yo butch ass up"
"8911","@De_La_Suede @ThatManDeemZ But back to Shazam. I think it’s taken GoTG’s spot on my overall list"
"8912","Go. See. Shazam. It’s so very very good. Funny, full to the brim with great action and heart. Absolutely worth your time."
"8913","Shazam was pretty fun! It’s nice just to sit and laugh at silly things and not take a movie too seriously lollll also...I always enjoy hearing mark str*ng’s accent ;^)"
"8914","I liked Shazam a lot. It's got a lot of little plot holes and leaps in logic, but I think the wholesomeness of it really won me over. Also, I've been a fan of the characters since the 90s and seeing them full in costume was absolutely delightful."
"8915","Y’all see me at school and I’m in a tight spot, you best believe I’m yelling Shazam and speedin out of it."

"8919","@TheHorrorGuru @radactvspcmud @Count_Jackula Shazam! Is easily the best in the DC Cinematic Universe. It's what DC should have done in the first place with its films. Embrace the weird and goofy."
"8920","@KyleThatKyle Personally, I thought #Shazam was poorly edited! Too many subplot dead-ends or pointless plot points!"
"8921","I laughed. Which is good cause I hated what this is playing off."
"8922","DC really did that with shazam"
"8923","SHAZAM! is a movie that's really happy it's a superhero movie and that makes me happy too"

"8937","@RRTwriting @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Agreed!!!!"
"8938","Watch Shazam today. I went in with low expectations but I really enjoyed it. A character kept reminding me of a character from a mid-2000's TV show &amp; then randomly later the actor who played that character popped up! I wish I could say more but I can't without big spoilers."

"8940","Shazam was a great watch. I highly recommend it. @ZacharyLevi was fantastic. The DC universe has had two hits in a row! #Shazam #dccomics #mycaptainmarvel"
"8941","That line in Shazam:

“You do nothing. You take selfies and make people pay you for them.”

I felt that."
"8942","That line in #Shazam :

“You do nothing...you take selfies      and make people pay you for them.”

I felt that."
"8943","Twitter convinced me to go see Shazam"
"8944","#Shazam is a lot of fun which is what most of these #dc movies have been missing."
"8945","Still waiting for someone to leak the Shazam end credits sequence, the animation was top notch and had an into the spiderverse vibe...but 2D!"
"8946","#SHAZAM is so, so good. DC needs to start modeling all their movies after #WonderWoman, #Aquaman, and this. DC has always had the superior characters and have finally captured the right creative teams to prove it."
"8947","I definitely didn't expect for anything that happened on #ShazamMovie! 

It was wonderful and if you haven't watched it yet, you should try it out... It is different from everything we have seen as DCEU fans, but it is a good kind of different~"
"8948","I honestly still am shocked with the movie. 

I totally recommend going to the movies to watch #Shazam you won't regret it, holy molly!"
"8949","@MajorSpoilers I only wish Shazam had matured a little bit by the end. LOVED Dr. Sivana."
"8950","Add whorephobia to this list!"
"8951","@ShazamMovie is honestly my fav superhero movie. I’m so freakin ecstatic that @ZacharyLevi is finally getting the recognition he so definitely deserves. He’s been my favorite for so darn long (plus no one else could make the facial expressions needed to make this movie 100%)"
"8952","@jere7my Have there been any gater complaints about “forced diversity” in Shazam?  Cause, dude, the movie was amazeballs."
"8953","I am watching Shazam rn and y’all. This bitch is the truth. This joint it too good. Please go see it."
"8954","@ShokXoneStudios I remember this got a really hearty ""That's what you get"" laugh in my cinema.

I'd also post ""That sounds like a butt thing"" from Shazam but it just came out so I'll be back in three months"
"8955","@LuLu_juice Affirmative. I enjoyed Shazam much more than I was originally expecting. Certainly better than Captain Marvel."
"8956","@DiscussingFilm That would be too simple wouldn't it? ALL, we can do from a fandom perspective is keep hope, that the cinematic stays on the   path of good, solid, enjoyable movies like Shazam, Aquaman, &amp; WW, call it sequel or not, who cares, so long as we get solid enjoyable DC movies."
"8957","how mary had so little scenes in shazam... esp when she [redacted] <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"8958","Just watched @ShazamMovie and it is without question the best movie in the DC Universe. Worth a watch while still in theaters."
"8959","It was great seeing the Ironist in #Shazam @ShazamMovie #atomiccounty #TheOC"
"8960","What makes #Shazam so special is the amazing chemistry between the family. Reminded me of those some of those great 80s and 90s tv shows. I would watch this movie even if it didn't have any superheroes in it."
"8961","Little SHAZAM! game
The first 2 people in your @‘s are young, and old Billy 
  
Young Billy: @KianJudge 

Shazam: @Minnow1233 

(Wow that worked well for Minnow)"
"8962","My #shazam review: I had a great time until &lt;that&gt; reveal. Then my entire theater erupted in applause and I wept. Sometimes I get bogged down in the day to day of our business. But today I was reminded of why we do this. <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F9E1><U+0001F49B><U+0001F49A><U+0001F499><U+0001F49C>"
"8963","@chihiroirina I was shocked in that scene. Superman having snacks with shazam at their school<U+0001F602>"
"8964","Shazam was simultaneously a wonderful heartwarming family film while being a movie I would have been absolutely terrified to see as a kid"
"8965","Armys remember we need to multi-task in order to achieve our goals.

Stream on YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, ITUNES, and don’t forget to SHAZAM and request on radio!

Don’t just choose where to stream, because we need to focus on official streaming platforms if we want to break our record."
"8966","Shazam was pure fun. Zachary Levi totally nailed it. No forced humor and a very smooth screenplay makes it one of the best movies of DC Universe. 

#Shazam"
"8967","some people prolly call it something else, but I'm hereby dubbing the Pichu down b Thunder spike the ""SHAZAM!"""
"8968","But anyways shazam was nice. But why they remove dwayne johnson. Isnt he suppose to be black adam"
"8969","Alright Shazam was dope. @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi all we need is @Y_Strahovski in the sequel <U+0001F64F>"
"8970","Saw Shazam! today. Fun flick. Nothing Earth shattering, and I think it could've done some things better, but overall a solid couple hours spent at the theater. Seeing Pet Sematary tomorrow night."
"8971","Shazam! Was absolutely hilarious, and fun. The elements from Superman (Reeves) and Big (Tom Hanks) definitely work together. I cannot wait for the eventual sequel."
"8972","@GJFrye The fundamental issue is that Shazam doesn’t stand for anything if it isn’t searching out the pure of heart. It becomes about power instead of morality and goodness. Which is what the seven deadly sins offer."
"8973","@GJFrye He shared Shazam because otherwise he couldn’t separate the villain from the sins. It’s a dramatic choice that serves plot over character."
"8974","@GJFrye This doesn’t solve the issue of what “shazam” means. I don’t think Billy needed to be perfect; but he didn’t have a perception of the world beyond himself. At the end, his choice to share Shazam is bolstered by narrative necessity, not kindness."
"8975","@GJFrye But he didn’t have to make that choice until after he became Shazam."
"8976","So. Just saw #ShazamMovie for a second time. That's it, that's all. As crazy good the 2nd time as the 1st. Prob gonna go for my own personal record of seeing a movie in the theater. At this rate I'll best myself in a weeks time lol"
"8977","@MzBlackCanary @nubiasprince There's so many errors in those two tweets but imma hope you guys got the jist. I just saw Shazam again so apparently I'm shook af and can't type <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"8978","Saw Shazam this evening and I REALLY liked it! It is easily the best DC movie... and even though that isn't much of a compliment, it is still a really good movie in general. 

SHAZAM! <U+26A1><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F9D9><U+0001F3FF><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F42F>"
"8979","Shazam was fucking great. I really gotta watch aquaman"
"8980","Just finished watching SHAZAM and gotta say... it’s prettt good! Very funny super hero movie. #SHAZAM"
"8981","When the neighbor’s music is so loud you can Shazam it"
"8982","@KAGReacts I agree. Some people are calling it a near-perfect CBM and I wouldn't go that far though I enjoyed it. As a comic book reader though, some moments really did hit me emotionally seeing it live action. #Shazam"
"8983","Seeing a few people here and there debating on which Captain Marvel/Shazam is best between the old school version and the modern version. Tbh I like the modern version better because he's not just ""magical Superman"" anymore. Modern version is more individualized."
"8984","@ShazamMovie This movie was a lot of fun"
"8985","@ShazamMovie The best parts kept it real."
"8986","@ponysmasher Will you release a special version of Shazam like Marvel did with Deadpool?"
"8987","@vinaldo7 #Shazam ?... to me it was like returning to Spider-Man by Raimi. 2000’s, it is when SH movies started to get great."
"8988","@CalumSanderson @BobDigi69 I actually can imagine people having MOS, BvS, WW  or Aquaman in spot 1... I guess even SS or #Shazam but my guess is those who prefer those 2 maybe don’t like that much the other 4, they have other kind of taste."
"8989","I loved Shazam so much, I can't stop thinking about it"
"8990","Such a great movie!"
"8991","dude @ZacharyLevi was created to be Shazam. #ShazamMovie"
"8992","Ummmm Shazam is actually a Christmas movie."
"8993","Won’t it be dull/when we rid ourselves of all these demons haunting us/to keep us company"
"8994","found family tropes never get old, shazam has my approval"
"8995","Shazam was really good, but I'm sure about half the references went above my head because I don't know DC comics. Especially the end credit scene."
"8996","@cgibsonREX @MikeKalinowski In your opinion which is fine of course.....agree to disagree...#Shazam was fun, no doubt, but it had it's own set of issues.....but compared with the #MCU #CaptainMarvel was better. That being said, so happy the DCEU, or whatever it's called, is on the right track..FINALLY"
"8997","@BigTony1028 I adored Shazam and I’m sure you’ll love it. I’m just one of few people who thinks MOS is a masterpiece"
"8998","#Shazam was awesome.  So entertaining the entire time. I only feel bad because of how amazing the entire #dccomics movie universe could have been with all of these characters together with Shazam in the mix."
"8999","Shazam in a while"
"9000","So really enjoyed Shazam, some laugh out loud funny moments and an entertaining cast and story. That said word of caution on taking kids, there are scenes in this that could traumatize a younger kid"
"9001","Yes it is “innovative” and “fun” but yet they are flossing. Nah fam im good"
"9002","SHAZAM! Is great. Liked it as much as AQUAMAN which is saying a lot. Love the DC Movie course correction. They’re getting to the point where they’re almost outfunning and outcrazying Marvel."
"9003","I just watched shazam, Its actually pretty good."
"9004","These #MAMA people have gone too far. They're ruining America!"
"9005","I LOVE #Shazam but y’all need to respect power rangers just a little <U+0001F602>"
"9006","Stop what you're doing and go see #Shazam immediately!"
"9007","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Honestly speaking. Shazam is the first movie in a very long time that made me leave the movies happy and excited and still thinking wow that movie was really nice"
"9008","@ShazamMovie Great superhero
Great dialogue 
Great story
Great performance
Great cast
Great villain
Everything in the movie was great
That movie is WOW
Shazam can easily take the place as the face of Dc comics
I left the movies excited &amp; happy for seeing an awesome movie
5/5"
"9009","Yo so all the Shazam hype is well founded. More than anything I think it succeeds in nailing its tone. The Funny scenes are allowed to be funny, the dramatic scenes are dramatic and the scary scenes are actually scary."
"9010","i wanted to cry watching it, but ehhh... Idk maybe i have seen better???? should’ve watch Shazam instead???"
"9011","if u wanna know how old i am just remember that during Adam Brody's scene in Shazam i forgot his name so i called him ""Rachel Bilson's boyfriend in The OC""."
"9012","shazam was actually funny unlike that other movie full of adult jokes <U+0001F92A>"

"9017","@Jenklens_ You know you fucked up when Shazam did a better job with 20 seconds than Justice League did with 20 minutes"
"9018","All I wanted from Shazam was it's mid-credits sequence. That's all that ever mattered, hope against hope that it would happen. AND it did!!!<U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F601>"
"9019","@ponysmasher I have to ask... was it a stunt performer or did DJ finally get to wear the suit on the big screen?? BTW #SHAZAM was an absolute blast and really hit home with me as a ward of the state as a kid I was a habitual runaway and spent time in group homes."
"9020","Along with being a really good movie, #Shazam did a great job of not spoiling plot points (and a particular one-off gag) in their trailers."
"9021","So I just finished watching @ShazamMovie and I had so much fun! @ZacharyLevi and the whole Shazam Fam were so great. I laughed a lot and loved how he kind of made fun of some of the superhero movie tropes."
"9022","I finally saw Shazam! and I really fell in love with everything but more than everyone's performance even though I fell more in love with @ZacharyLevi, @AsherAngel and Jack."

"9025","@RandomHajile35 oh shit I forgot about Shazam with Sinbad"
"9026","Everyone needs to go see #SHAZAM. Such a fun movie!"
"9027","I really liked Shazam

#TysonsTakes"
"9028","@reggiegotlag Shazam and Wonder Woman are the only good ones"
"9029","There’s always been that point as a kid we wished we could’ve been a superhero and Shazam just exemplifies that dream.

Also shoutout to the first Injustice game where Shazam became my favourite DC character because of how ridiculous he is"
"9030","Ok Shazam was actually amazing. It was fun, sweet and so damn enjoyable. 

I also love the fact that it shows you can find family anywhere as I was also someone who was in a foster home. Family isn’t blood but who you bring into your life unconditionally."
"9031","#Shazam successfully proves that not all superheroes need to be grim and dark. Its fu filled movie event for the whole family. And what a big surprise for the fans in that carnival scene! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F609><U+0001F910> #ShazamMovie

"9033","Shazam was a lot of fun. Seriously. I'm ready to reboot the DC movie universe around him &amp; Wonder Woman."
"9034","So I just got back from seeing Shazam, and it is painfully, obviously clear that Shazam was DC's attempt to replicate the wild success that was Spider-Man: Homecoming.
Fortunately, they remembered to replicate the part where it is a good and fun movie."
"9035","The best part about Shazam is that it makes absolutely no effort to tie itself to the DC Extended Universe beside going ""yeah these other heroes exist and are well-known"" so you can just pretend it's in its own separate film canon for now"
"9036","@The_Zodi_Lady I know literally only just enough about Captain Marvel/Shazam to have been able to go ""oh shit that's Sivana"" and then later ""oh shit, that's Black Adam"""
"9037","@TheSAPeacock @ShazamMovie I loved it, so much fun."
"9038","So I just saw #Shazam and overall I enjoyed it. I just thought some of the lines and scenes were a little cheesy. Can't hate too much though because one scene almost made me throw my popcorn.

Literally I almost tossed it"
"9039","Shazam is a charming and lighthearted superhero movie that delivers important lessons about life and family. It’s one of my favorite movies to come from DC - I’d definitely recommend it!"
"9040","i totally watching"
"9041","Just saw #Shazam and I think this was @DCComics attempt to rip off Monster’s Inc. It was like the DC writers got drunk and pillaged their copyrights to see which @Disney concept might make a nice super hero movie. If you don’t believe me just watch DC’s “The Little Mermaid”"
"9042","SO SHAZAM REVIEW:

- very very funny
- kinda cringy/cheesy at times
- idk much about the character so the plottwist was really really good
- zach levi is AMAZING
- darla, i will protect you with my whole life sweetheart 
- overall, it was an okay enjoyable movie
           8/10"
"9043","Gremlins is gory and tells you a horrifying story that lets you know Santa isn’t real. Ghostbusters has a ghost giving Dan Aykroyd a blowjob and Bill Murray saying “this man has no dick.”

Shazam has a couple shots from *outside* a gentlemen’s club, and an offscreen decapitation."
"9044","@HgMorbi God did they ever, honestly.

I admit I know bascally nothing at all about Shazam so going into it I was very surprised."
"9045","Just saw Shazam and as a firm believer that the DC movies have been really bad recently I will say this ......SHAZAM IS REALLY GOOD 10/10 would watch again"
"9046","Shazam=great movie 
I highly recommend"
"9047","if you get the the Shazam and Flash symbols mixed up.....

Pass the blunt"
"9048","#Shazam easily the best movie DC has put out in a long time. Aquaman was tough but Shazam was way better. Wonder Woman ain’t fuckin with it either"
"9049","One of the weirdest things about #Shazam is that it is so obvious that they forgot to film more establishing shots of the front of the school cause almost every shot of it has the same kids wearing the same clothes doing the exact same thing. It is so weird!!"
"9050","Just saw @ShazamMovie and I hope @ZacharyLevi gets the credit he deserves. From Chuck to Tangled to most recently Mrs. Maisel (AND THEY BETTER BRING HIM BACK) and now #SHAZAM. Wonderful. Also Jack Grazer and Asher Angel — perfectly cast. Amazing actors all around."
"9051","Couldn’t agree more with this. Zachary Levi was meant to be Shazam"
"9052","literally the most iconic"
"9053","Does Twitter have a limit as for how many people you can add to a DM group chat? My Shazam group chat idea has gotten a little out of hand, and it stops letting me add people after 49."
"9054","Go see #SHAZAM!  Most fun I've had watching a movie with superheroes in it since Ragnarok"
"9055","There are some moments that feel like a rated R movie which really shock me. The best way to describe Shazam is a mixture of Raimi Spider-Man and Fantastic Four."
"9056","Shazam or his original name Captain Marvel is great and one favorite DC movies. The actor of Marvel capture so well of inner child of Billy. All the children actors are great."
"9057","Spoilers, I became super nerdy when in the third act have Shazam/Captian Marvel Family. This a nerd nitpick, but I wish the movie called Billy as Captain Marvel."
"9058","Shazam subverts some cliches like the CGI monster battle because they need to have a host. I really like the designs of seven deadly sins but I don't like all of their colors are grey. I wish the put some color to make them look a bit unique."
"9059","#Shazam in #imax! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> best start to celebrating our Anniversary! @ZacharyLevi the hype is real!"
"9060","So @4MeSheWILL are you really not going to see Shazam or..."
"9061","Had a fun, full day of adventure with my buddy Sean. First up, we saw Shazam. Wonderful movie. Funny, exciting, visually snappy, and much more emotionally and tonally complex than I expected without losing the charm and warmth."

Like of course it is the best DCEU but it may very well rocket up to my favorite superhero film. Like did think more on some flaws but it actually made a lot of good choices and just aaaa the whole vibe and tone I love it so much"
"9098","@CapedJoel I thought it was their best dc film yet, I laughed the whole time, they made the transition between Billy and Shazam great(both actors were in sync which is usually not the case these switch films), the third act was great too, like Marvel could learn a lesson from it"
"9099","Just watched @ShazamMovie. Overall, good movie. Good acting. Good story. Not so great score. Would mainly recommend it for children for its childish content and comedy. Nevertheless, it is an entertained movie that can be stand by any audience."

3. The main character wastes much of his time fooling around after power up
4. There isn't much of scenes where general audience could care for.."
"9104","@gavinfeng97 1. Humor Code in Shazam is not working outside of U.S

2. It's a 'For Kids' Superhero movie so,
not much for general audience to get attached to.

3. It's a family movie, 
but there isn't much of a family building scene until the very end.

4. Villain, CGI sucks &amp; Hype was so Low"
"9105","A true inspiration to us all"
"9106","I loved Shazam! definitely the best DC universe movie by far"
"9107","on point with @wbpictures butchering things and still not getting it. Imagine if they showed #Cavill and imagine the bigger joy people will get...but they wint because they prefer Bronze instead of Gold. a studio with the word ""picture"" in its name just can't see the big picture?"
"9108","@minjingunner Maybe... BUT!!!...I need to see the #SnyderCut of #JusticeLeague first because whatever happened in that film may have justified the transition to #Aquaman &amp; #Shazam but we wont know until @wbpictures actually go to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut
if not then #wba loves bad film making!!!"

P.S. F**K Donald Trump"
"9113","Did not make it to the wine store in time because I stayed for both of #Shazam's post-credit scenes. But I am writing a #FilministPod one pager. Which leads me to a question: what direction(s) would you like to see the podcast take? Remember, this is just as much YOUR podcast!"
"9114","@LandonOLeary @nexuspong And what it means? #Shazam doesn't belong to #DCEU?"
"9115","Just seen this movie its fucking ausome i suggust going to see it filmed@here in toronto and in philaphelphia as well"
"9116","@ZacharyLevi Great job. Easily the best DC movie yet. I took my wife to @ShazamMovie and she loved it, which is saying something about a superhero movie."

"9121","Shazam was a good movie, I recommend it to anyone who was skeptical"
"9122","@jokoanwar have u seen Shazam? been a while since a superhero film made me feel giddy as a kid. cominf from DC, made it even more awesome. hope ur movie will leave this feeling as well..."
"9123","When I first saw the Shazam previews I thought Jimmy Fallon was the star and ew. I haven’t been able to overcome that mistaken rejection, but it’s got a 90% RT audience score so maybe I’ll go watch it Tuesday a.m."
"9124","I enjoyed the movie Shazam,  not exactly your super hero movie but still funny and worth seeing! My movie review of the week! lol"
"9125","im seeing shazam tomorrow and the post credits scene...... the things i have accidentally heard.... what the fuck goes on in dc"
"9126","Thanks @Fandango for the Early Access tickets to #SHAZAM

"9134","@norasakavic Darla, I’ve just seen Shazam for the second time and it feels like a great name"
"9135","Shazam and Thor would have fun lightning times together. #Thor #MCURewatch"
"9136","Please see Shazam it is So Good and the Kids Are Excellent and the writing was *italian kiss* and please I beg you go watch those amazing and wonderful children act and tell a good story."
"9137","Just need to know why the Joker trailer didn’t play in front of Shazam <U+0001F9D0>"
"9138","(( Just saw Shazam. Super fun movie. Molly would like it. Evil Molly would like it but claim that it was stupid because of her image. ))"
"9139","@ZacharyLevi Could have sworn you just walked by me on 45th about an hour ago! I yelled ""SHAZAM!"" You didn't hear me, but one of the girls with you looked back over her shoulder at me. Been a fan since Chuck! Saw Shazam 2 weeks ago at an early preview! Excellent work, sir!"
"9140","Shazam might be my favorite super hero story. I’m currently buying all the comics."
"9141","Just got home from watching Shazam! Mind blown again! It's so nice to see Adam Brody! It's awesome to see both Ben McKenzie and Adam Brody in the DC Universe! They were in FOX's The O.C. the tv show!"
"9142","@paramourer bold of you to call me a nerd miss ive watched shazam 140 times"
"9143","Guess who’s watching Shazam and guess who’s gonna scream when they play legend"
"9144","Shazam? My favorite DC movie.

  Absolutely hysterical. Really good message. Knows what it is and acts accordingly. 

Loved it."
"9145","Ending to Shazam had me speechless, can't wait for Justice League 2."
"9146","Marvel has competition with DC after #Shazam"
"9147","@ShazamMovie Nope. I ain't watching the joker movie either."
"9148","#shazam was....actually terrible. Besides Zachary Levi, the foster family and like a few jokes. That was a mess. Electric chair."
"9149","@CalumSanderson @burbank_isaac @rianjohnson @mattsinger At least Shazam got a waaay better audience reception unlike....."
"9150","@HackinTimSeeley i just love how the future movies will each have their own individual tones, like Shazam is a funny tone, batman is dark, and birds of prey is dark comedy-ish"
"9151","DC has finally emerged as something other than the ugly step child of Marvel with Shazam."
"9152","@kaifhossainhash @AndrewK300 Shazam is flopping at bo..its shit.."
"9153","Went to the show, Shazam was pretty fun, good, realistic &amp; diverse casting, a very good DC movie. #RepresentationMatters #ShazamTedTalk"
"9154","@JpqJames @FlyingScots18 @ShazamMovie If there is a god, we killed him."
"9155","Soooooo, Shazam was major cringe. DC might just need a whole hard reset if it wants to actually compete with Marvel"
"9156","I promise to work hard, focus, and try and strengthen my community by being a serious #insurance professional.

(I may have just watched #Shazam , I think insurance professionals can be reluctant heroes too @TonyCanas4 ??)

#insurtech #Professional"
"9157","@LivingDedGerl shiettt, i still haven't watched shazam. Is it really better than the other dc movies"
"9158","Shazam is easily the greatest movie of the year, maybe even of the decade."
"9159","@wehaveahulkpod @allthingshulk Saw it. Not the Power of Hope #CaptainMarvel #Shazam but an interpretation not truly liked by Fawcett fans...but I enjoyed it more than other die hard CaptMarvel purist...(no disrespect to them since I am 75% one of them) 

Next one a bit less goofy please?!?!"
"9160","I’m bout to roll up and go watch Shazam with hella snacks cuz I been a good daddy all day <U+0001F602>"
"9161","Shazam is rated PG-13. It’s not rated as a kids film. That’s all."
"9162","Why does everything have to happen in April? 2 games long waited for World War Z &amp; Days gone. Danielle panabakers directorial debut. Pet Semetary, Avengers end game, &amp; Shazam in theaters. Screw it no sleep for April. #shenanigans"
"9163","Someone tell Hollywood, picking different colors for casting is not Diversity. #shazam"
"9164","In 2014 I saw a short horror YouTube video called “Lights out” that I really loved. Now 5 years later I just got out of the theater watching Shazam, which is directed by the same man! Congrats @ponysmasher I can’t wait to see what you’ll do next!!!"
"9165","@ZacharyLevi I just finished watching Shazam in theatres! So many references, fight scenes, and hilarity :D Please make a sequel! You and the other cast members were fantastic!"
"9166","Besties date night to see #Shazam and hookah <U+0001F970>"
"9167","@The_Meatball_84 @BobDigi69 @BaramosGonus Hate to break it to you but that logic is flawed. WB saw that it isn't worth paying Cavill a bunch of money for a brief cameo, so they didn't, but if there's a Shazam vs Black Adam movie coming our way then he's far, far more likely to be featured in that."
"9168","@BaramosGonus @BobDigi69 My prediction/wish: WB will notice the audience's positive reaction to seeing Superman with Shazam on screen, and will allow Garcia &amp; The Rock to bring in Cavill's Superman for the Shazam vs Black Adam movie (Garcia is Dwayne's PR guy too and they're working on Black Adam)."
"9169","@The_Meatball_84 @BobDigi69 @BaramosGonus Well the thing is, all we know about Henry's contract is that he's supposed to be featured in 1-2 more films. If he showed up in Shazam then WB would've had to pay him an amount that has already been agreed on, and they believed it wasn't worth it. It totally sucks, but still."
"9170","@BobDigi69 @The_Meatball_84 @BaramosGonus In Shazam you mean?

That must have something to do with The Rock's schedule and David's plans for the sequel. Thankfully we got a tease to start the Black Adam hype."
"9171","So nobody is going to mention that @ShazamMovie looks just like @AdamCarollaShow @adamcarolla ?"
"9172","Shazam was definitely on par with spiderverse. It was fun and charming and sweet."
"9173","can someone explain the caterpillar please <U+0001F41B> #Shazam"
"9174","Hey everyone, we are proud to finally announce our new EP is up on iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play, Amazon, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and Shazam! So much time &amp; effort went into making these songs, so thanks for all the support &amp; to @nadarecording. Go listen!"
"9175","@ponysmasher 
Greetings from Chile and congratulations for the great success of SHAZAM.
After watching the movie, I began to ask if in one of those, if there was a possibility, if there is a small beam of light... would you be willing to direct a sequel to #MoS2?"
"9176","@StLaurentDomII Just got back from seeing Shazam. Cleaning the house now."
"9177","why is SHAZAM good? who let this absolute C-team ass superhero gain the ability to make <U+0001F3C2>ME<U+0001F3C2>™ cry?"
"9178","we interrupt your CATS programming to stan SHAZAM - a movie I went to see thinking it would be bad but cried at twice (2x)"
"9179","@AlmondMilkHotel @GriffLightning one thing I love about SHAZAM is that in SHAZAM, when the hero says Shazam he turns into the hero Shazam, and personally I think that reflects the value of the cinematic medium"
"9180","ok be real who let SHAZAM be great this is fucked up my 2nd fav movie of 2019 14 weeks in should not be SHAZAM but here we are this timeline is wild"
"9181","@Partizan_Niksic @Vibhujay @CinemaScore @ShazamMovie How can it flopping , if Shazam made 160 million the movie is making profit .. haters!!"
"9182","@ZacharyLevi Since seeing the movie, both of my kids have been yelling “SHAZAM!” before doing things like riding their bikes and getting their PJs on. Needless to say, we all LOVED the movie! Thanks a ton, man! #Shazam"
"9183","@OriginalFunko Awesome! I'd love to win! Thanks! #Shazam"
"9184","I saw #Shazam today! It was fun. It was nice to see a superhero movie where the superhero was actually excited about getting superpowers, instead of moping and grumbling about ""great responsibility"" or whatever."
"9185","Even through the rain I should have gone to see #Shazam today #capekino"
"9186","Shazam was super good omg. One of the best superhero movies I’ve ever seen ez"
"9187","anyway Shazam is the best DC movies ive ever watched so far. even i love Aquaman, but still, not enough."
"9188","If Billy Batson says “Shazam” in a swimming pool full of people, would they all get electrocuted?"
"9189","Spent hours playing boardgames, seeing Shazam and reviewing some games. What R U doing?"
"9190","@tonygoldmark Out of curiosity seen Shazam yet?"
"9191","Just saw #ShazamMovie, and it was a joyful experience! Love it! @ZacharyLevi, my heart is full and happy, and this was honestly one of the best movies I’ve seen!"
"9192","Just watched Shazam! and my son Billy Batson made me so proud <U+0001F62D><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"9193","@Photoartistx @TheMickeyM @BlackMajikMan90 @DrDc989 @blue_domain @DEADLINE Esp since Shazam only had 90 mil budget and achieve more than 200 mil budget of Captain Marvel."
"9194","I would tweet a full review of #Shazam but @Raj_Sharan won’t see it for months so I can’t <U+0001F614>"
"9195","@MTLSaiyan This was me when I left the theater from seeing Isle of Dogs lol. Have yet to see Shazam but I don’t trust review scores sometimes.

Seems like it suffers from a lot of Thor: Ragnarok issues, which Imo is another overrated movie. Can’t speak for Shazam myself though."
"9196","This is what you do @brielarson @Marvel #CaptainMarvelCountry #hatecrime brie Carson inspired the sexist criminal."
"9197","That 5 minute GODZILLA I-MAX TRAILER for “SHAZAM”WAS INSAIN! The crowd went crazy!"
"9198","So, #Shazam is damn delight.  

It is probably the least Punk Rock movie ever.  Leave all your cynicism at the door."
"9199","Finished the header :)
gunna post it tomorrow + seeing shazam tomorrow :)"
"9200","#Shazam was prob the best DC movie out there so far"
"9201","shazam was the funniest dc movie I've ever seen and enjoyed wholeheartedly. I would definitely see it again."
"9202","shazam was a great movie i won’t allow any slander to my man @ZacharyLevi PUT SOME RESPECT ON IT"
"9203","Finally DC made another great movies. #SHAZAM"
"9204","I know absolutely nothing about #Shazam but having his family all have abilities is cute and awesome. They were all so cool."
"9205","I can't believe I'm saying this big DC knock it out the park with this one"
"9206","Girl, Shazam cured your depression what were you expecting lmao"
"9207","#Shazam was incredible! It was hilarious and easily the best DCEU movie"
"9208","@radioryanchase @ShazamMovie I was trying to decide whether to see it."
"9209","@ponysmasher Ayo was that scene at the beginning of Shazam (kid holding dad) a reference to Blood Simple?"
"9210","@SalSaysWhat for me it was like the best Marvel film they never made, Dr Sivana instantly became one of my favorite villains (definitely the best DCEU villain), the transition between Billy &amp; Shazam was in sync, loved the characters &amp; the build up to the third act &amp; third act were great"
"9211","pls support my sons and see shazam"
"9212","We took 4 kids to see Shazam today. What a great movie! Wasn’t really expecting the dark bits, and the major fight scene is always 3-12mins too long imo, but a solid afternoon of entertainment and so far no nightmares for the 7, two 8, 9yos."
"9213","Shazam! is my favorite DC movie and the only one I'd pay to see again. 
Go and give that kid some love~"
"9214","@JeremySimser @garpike28 @FrankKemp3 @LaurenGallaway @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie True but I don’t think this is really a spoiler to complain about. Something specific created *for* the movie, yes by all means. But something like this? All it takes is looking at Shazam’s wikipedia page to find the family."
"9215","@JeremySimser @garpike28 @FrankKemp3 @LaurenGallaway @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie Pop’s are aimed at nerdy people and comic book culture is nerdy. Like... if you want to avoid spoilers for common knowledge about a superhero maybe don’t ever go on the internet?"
"9216","@cam__hill @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie It has source material????"
"9217","@blessed_bailey Mhm! I bet! The guy playing Shazam voices Flynn Rider in Tangled.
<U+0001F49C><U+270C><U+FE0F>"
"9218","Shazam was the first DC movie that I could actually finish watching without falling asleep"
"9219","The most unrealistic thing in Shazam was the fact that those YouTube videos uploaded in just a couple seconds"
"9220","Cinetopia just played two different Pokemon trailers and one for a movie that released last month...
What?

Oh and Shazam! Was good."
"9221","So Shazam is very sweet, more than a bit silly, and has excellent end credits."
"9222","Shazam’s name is Captain Marvel <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923> 

He says Shazam to turn into dude <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923> 

I haven’t seen the movie yet btw"
"9223","@benwallfisch Followed because of your score for Shazam! (saw it earlier tonight) - I'm listening to it right now! I LOVE the sweeping heroism, the orchestration... thanks for bringing this style back! I can't wait until the physical CD release."
"9224","I could be watching Dumbo or Shazam; yet here I am, sitting in #PetSematary about to piss on myself."
"9225","Personally, I understand why that cameo in Shazam was done the way it was. Probably didn’t have the budget to pay the actor and contract drama behind the scenes got in the way."
"9226","Shazam was awesome! It made you appreciate the super fandom in the movie! #shazam"
"9227","It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.#sunday #SundayTimesZA #SundayThoughts #SundayMotivation #SundayMorning #SundayBrunch #SundayService #Sunday #sundayidolart #sundaytoday #sundaytimes #sundaytoday #Svengoolie #Shazam #Spartans #SudanUprising"
"9228","My internet is really shitty these days but I WENT TO SEE SHAZAM and it's pretty cool :D loved the cast &lt;3 the kid actors are so lovely"
"9229","@Orion_Fallout I wish I could say shazam and transform your opinions into good ones hah gottim"
"9230","JUST SAW SHAZAM AND IT WAS SO GOOD!!! Gotta wait three weeks until Endgame now. Its going to be a depressing three weeks!"
"9231","@TheVideoGamHer Just left Shazam and a lot of people are overhyping this movie there was a lot of bad dialog/ acting in the beginning of the movie..... It wasn't a bad movie but it sure isn't what it was hyped up to be. <U+0001F60F>"
"9232","Shazam is so good and wholesome"
"9233","@CadmusReed @garpike28 @FrankKemp3 @LaurenGallaway @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie I can choose to avoid internet places that I think will spoil things and sadly that Helena to include Funko now, too."
"9234","@CadmusReed @garpike28 @FrankKemp3 @LaurenGallaway @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie But again...every example you gave is of someone actively seeking out information, whether it be by reading the source books or going to Wikipedia.

Funko put spoilery pictures on their feed for anyone who follows them to see. Saying they are for nerdy people doesn't excuse it"
"9235","@CadmusReed @garpike28 @FrankKemp3 @LaurenGallaway @OriginalFunko @ShazamMovie Which not every body has read"
"9236","me trying not to talk about shazam cause its spoilers but i really wanna talk about it"
"9237","UPDATE: I went to see Shazam and I got my essay done. <U+0001F918><U+0001F3FD>"
"9238","Shocked and disgusted"
"9239","#shazam is an absolute DELIGHT and there are a million things about it that deserve a tweet but above all else:

I need Faithe Herman as Lunella Lafayette in a live action #MoonGirlandDevilDinosaur film IMMEDIATELY."
"9240","#shazam<U+2060> <U+2060> is an absolute DELIGHT! @ZacharyLevi was excellent as expected but the real stars were all of those kids! Such great performances from every single one of them!"
"9241","Ok i'll be on and off because, i'm watching shazam again screams!! )"
"9242","Saying that ""SHAZAM!"" is the best live action DC Comics movie so far doesn't really mean anything considering the questionable quality that their films have so I'll just say this: This movie is either a lightning in a bottle (get it?) or a sign that they're trying."
"9243","Shazam's movie, an allusion to a test where someone is pure of heart in order to 'transcend'.

Totally contrary to Jesus Christ and His redemptive act, where He, God alive, offer us the way to transcend into Christ. Knowing!, that we aren't good/pure!"
"9244","If you guys plan on watching Shazam!, watch in 4D!!

My kuripot ass is shakin, but I swear it’s worth your money! Imagine every time he says Shazam, all the chairs in the cinema shake and a flash of light goes off because LIGHTNING (and this is almost every 10 mins yall)<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"9245","So there I am loving @ShazamMovie and suddenly my buddy @RossButler is on screen and being awesome!!!
Mind, blown. Movie, dope."
"9246","Shazam is 80% finding out who sang this awful cover playing in a random coffee shop I’m in so I know who to needlessly hate on"
"9247","@ZacharyLevi I have watched it twice and taken two families and am also playing DCUO Shazam level for gear:) Please satisfy my craziness am I crazy that I saw a ton of hints for Tawney? You were everything I hoped for the character.   Would love a DM on all the tiger hints;)excellent job!!"
"9248","Where is a superhero--or even @Madea-- when you need them!?! But despite all that (and the broken air conditioning in our theater) @ShazamMovie was funny and fantastic. Now I'm headed to the showers to clean off the mucus and the pot smell. Nighty night. Shazam!!"
"9249","Wow. That was such a good day off, from start to finish. Spent the morning with Jen and my parents, talked wedding/house, worked out, went for a nice drive, saw Shazam, set up a Dungeon Zone in the basement for D&amp;D, worked on tomorrow's game, and now I'm watching anime.

Bliss."
"9250","I’m in the theater to see Shazam and an endgame promo came on and I shit you not guys, it went dead silent and after it ended you heard a guy go “oh fUCK” and honestly same though"
"9251","Just saw @ShazamMovie and I gotta say, after #BatmanandRobin and #Smallville, if  @RealJohnGlover makes one more DC Villain...we are gonna have to do something about it!"
"9252","The exploration of what Shazam can do is one of the best parts of any superhero movie that’s come out in the past 10 yrs, honestly. This movie unapologetic and bonkers but in most positive way. I can’t wait to see Shazam play around with more DC characters..."
"9253","So, my cousins told me that Shazam is a good movie"
"9254","#Shazam idk if this Is an SPOILER... Maybe

But I'm in love with the Marvel Family <U+0001F62D><U+0001F495>"
"9255","@weiro_O @kvngomez Back in early March. But I was referencing that I saw Shazam a couple weeks ago. And there IS one meta joke in the actual Captain Marvel."
"9256","Things that definitely happened in real life"
"9257","I just got back from #Shazam and I liked it quite a bit. Spoilers ahead.

I have problems with it, particularly it's ridiculous tonal whiplash. There's literally a scene in it where a boardroom of innocent people are eaten and slaughtered by demons and then pretty much the next"
"9258","I just got out of Shazam and I have a few thoughts: 
1) It was incredible. Go see it
2) RIP Billy Penn
3) never woulda thought SEPTA was the magical gateway to the wizard world"
"9259","4. #Shazam was fun, funny, and lighthearted. Very fitting for a family (christmas) movie. 8/10. 

2 post credit scenes <U+2757>"
"9260","omg his legs form an s in the air wtf<U+0001F62D>"
"9261","Is it weird that although I didn’t love the movie, the stakes felt higher in #SHAZAM than they did in #JossticeLeague? #ReleaseTheSnyderCut ... psa I did Like the film- but didn’t love."
"9262","Jesus who the fuck cares. No one but journos and other morons."
"9263","This Guy made my Shazam review for y'all."
"9264","Every time I say I love Shazam
A nerd somewhere is pissed"
"9265","Don't let the #Shazam trailers scare you away. The trailers aren't representative of the film at all. The film is actually way different than what the trailers show you. I promise your kids will scream Shazam at the end and enjoy this so much just like all the kids at my matinee."
"9266","shazam is the best movie ever made????"
"9267","shazam deserves to be in the avengers"
"9268","@nicklate93 @googamp32 Marketing was completely  different with Aquaman showing way more characters  than Shazam with 5 minutes of footage there from trailers than showing just 3 white dudes from  Shazam"
"9269","shazam was really good but the mc was real unlikable for the first half of the movie"
"9270","i think the worst part of shazam was when i walked into the theatre and i spilt some of my hot tea all over myself"
"9271","Loved Shazam!!! All of you need to go see it! SHAZAM <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"9272","I think u might like to hear this before I went to see Shazam Tonight which is lit I went to books.A.milllion to get JoJo part 3 &amp; the cashier he was JoJo &amp; Yu Yu fan as well,  Best part he was fan of u doesn't follow u on Twitter but i told him ya @ so he finds u @SavinTheBees"
"9273","I leave a few more details: In the session of #Shazam crowded where I was, people freaked out, laughed, thrilled and at the end of the day applauded him
<U+0001F44F><U+0001F632> <U+0001F602><U+0001F62D><U+0001F917><U+0001F60D> the mix of feelings that this film provokes is surreal, it will surely enter the list of many favorites"
"9274","#Shazam was honestly a really fun, light, great time that still took it’s serious moments serious. And didn’t need to overstuff with jokes that weren’t necessary. Allowed it’s characters to be smart and it’s villains to be bad without a sob story and I loved it!"
"9275","Me: 
*likes Shazam*

*goes on the internet*

The internet: “Shazam is garbage and if you liked it so are you”"
"9276","@DevanTHoward Sigh.
Not even, lol.

Although, Shazam magic partly comes from Wonder Woman's father, Zeus."
"9277","Having just come out of a Captain Marvel/Shazam double-feature, this is my comparison of their strengths;

#CaptainMarvel
-Villain, action, scale, KITTY!

#Shazam 
-Hero, humor, horror, heart, themes, characterization"
"9278","@ponysmasher Mr. Sandberg I would love to pass along a pretty funny idea to you for a sequal to Shazam but unfortunately I cant DM you. If you use it then HOLY MOLY if not then still worth it to tell you lol"
"9279","Just saw #Shazam for the 2nd time!!! My God it gets better with each viewing @ponysmasher you are seriously a genius. This movie is everything I wanted when I was a kid so thank you sir. Btw I have a great idea for rue sequal opening scene that I wish I could say but spoilers so."
"9280","@REKCO_J @Stemot1978 The darkest parts in Shazam are about as bad as any part I remember in the DCEU. Surprisingly awful things happen to people in this movie."
"9281","shazam was supee duper good and super duper dun, i absolutely recommend it"
"9282","The villian from Shazam looked very similar to sans. . ."
"9283","@GodzillaMovie @IMAX I just saw shazam in Imax and though it was a great movie, I was sad that they didn't play the exclusive 5 min"
"9284","Pleasantly surprised by #Shazam cause......that was a good movie.......and DC really did that.......I am confusion"
"9285","Every once in a while, in quiet moments, I am in awe of the fact we live in a world where #Aquaman actually got to exist on the big screen, where a #Shazam movie is happening, where the #Avengers are about to go into #Endgame...it’s all just incredible."
"9286","Shazam was actually really fucking good. Had tons of humor and really followed the comics well. This sounds nuts but I hold it over Aquaman for DC."
"9287","I transcended into another plane when Shazam flossed"
"9288","Shazam was...good?? 
I’m probably gonna...watch it again??? <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

"9290","@Kwite Love it when Shazam is the best DC movie"
"9291","Was not expecting Shazam to even be good but it surpassed my expectations, especially after seeing DC fumble every movies for years"
"9292","@benkendrick Three if the last four DC movies are really good, assuming Shazam is as good as reported. The further we get from Snyder the better the movies become. There is no reason to doubt this movie, in my opinion"
"9293","@ShazamMovie was great! Best thing DC has came out with lately and I'd have to give it to the casting directors mainly!"
"9294","JJ really has me wrapped around his finger bc we came to watch Shazam <U+0001F480>"
"9295","Oh no. This doesn't seem like bait. Definitely couldn't be bait."
"9296","Kick-ass, Spider-man Homecoming y Shazam son mi nueva holy trinity \ *^* /"
"9297","Saw Shazam tonight. It's a superb superhero film. Hit all the right ideas and themes that a superhero film should.
excellent"
"9298","My mind is always working on a story in the background while I do@other things. 
Tonight it presented me with two candidates for the end of the current novel I am working on   I considered both and pick one. 
Thank you brain, for your hard work while I was watching Shazam."
"9299","Novak really in the strip club on ducking Shazam I’m deceased lmao"
"9300","#Shazam was good, but it wasn't edgy enough, incoherent enough, visually dark enough and it was too funny to be a real DCEU movie."
"9301","You know there are a ton of really pissed of DC fanboys who really wanted a dark take on Shazam. Zack Snyder ruined a generation of fans"
"9302","Fun fact shazam is the original captain marvel but due to legal rights DC bought him and renamed him to shazam"
"9303","I was pretty low in Shazam, but thought I’d watch it anyways. I do have to say it was actually a pretty decent movie! <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FE>"
"9304","@schuckster I heard people were more scared during Shazam (*I havent seen either yet)"
"9305","Thanks @ponysmasher for creating a movie that made me feel like a kid again.   But most importantly,  showing a loving, caring foster home in a movie (such a rarity!)

#Shazam is a great superhero movie. #ShazamMovie"
"9306","Went to see the movie #ShazamMovie and it was really good tbh"
"9307","@EWDocJensen Yeah I'm sure #Shazam is great and all... outside of the completely offensive and rare double-punch of turning a strong disabled hero character into a powerless sidekick and able-facing the character itself by featuring an able-bodied actor rather than one with a disability. <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F><U+0001F644>"
"9308","I hated Shazam don’t come for me"
"9309","Holy shit! #Shazam was good!

That last fight was so fun and intelligent and they worked innate manofsteel homage.

Go see this movie"
"9310","Loved #Shazam for the disabled and Asian Hispanic and Black people of color representation as a Vietnamese European &amp; Polynesian Indigenous Pacific Islander person of color author comic book writer &amp; screenwriter disabled with aspergers depression anxiety panic attacks &amp; PTSD"
"9311","#NativeTwitter #Polynesian Shazam has disabled Asian Hispanic &amp; Black &amp; Polynesian Indigenous Pacific Islander representation go see this movie Its so amazing as a Vietnamese French &amp; Polynesian Tahitian Indigenous Pacific Islander author comic book writer &amp; screenwriter"
"9312","@writerhaha @YahooEnt Maybe you should first check what diversity is and also watch Shazam before you state your opinion"
"9313","best review of Shazam"
"9314","@ashleylynch Shazam is so good!

It's almost everything I wanted in a CM movie"
"9315","Shazam wasn’t bad. Would be dope to see him &amp; Superman go up against Black Adam in a sequel"
"9316","Okay. Shazam was pretty good and fun. I REALLY loved what they did at the end, and the ending credit animation is cute as heck."
"9317","Just went to see #Shazam in theatres. Thinking this is the kind of movie a fellow like @BishopBarron might use to talk about the 7 deadly sins. #HintHint"
"9318","@PsychoticSaito Dude please stop using cringy gifs and also... it's about Marvel vs DC duh.. also, Shazam looks really bad also just like the rest of DC"
"9319","Deleted scene of Dr. Sivana and Darla from Shazam."
"9320","The villain’s also not as bad as I’ve heard people say. He’s no joker, but he had actual, decent motivations and it felt like there were genuine stakes when he and Shazam fought, and he actually represented something in the film and nicely opposed Shazam’s character"
"9321","Shazam was great. It was practically perfect for what it was and it knew exactly what it wanted to be. And, unlike the other DC films so far, it had a plot, characters with flaws and arcs, and an actual theme. And it was presented like an old superhero flick, which I loved. 7/10"
"9322","Go see Shazam. You fuckers have aquaman one billion dollars. Go out and support a movie that’s unironically good (and that finally recognized my boy Zachary Levi)"
"9323","DC needs to stick with more scaled back, personal, focused films like this, because this isn’t just “good for a DC movie”, this is probably better than even a decent amount of marvel’s movies. DC needed more heart and Shazam really delivered"
"9324","Just saw #Shazam wow  I am pleasantly surprised with this movie and for the 1st time in a long time seeing a DC movie in the theater has me in a great mood and can't wait to see what's going to happen next it was hilarious action packed DC keep this going!!!"
"9325","Me watching #Shazam ""Seth Cohen (the biggest comic book nerd) is in a superhero movie!"" Also, this movie is really awesome! #ADAMBRODY"
"9326","Zachary Levi brought so much fun to the Shazam. Great movie overall. 10/10. Would recommend <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>"

"9329","If my dad goes to see Shazam tomorrow with my brothers and never asked me, he ain’t getting any rent money from me this month"
"9330","So proud of the DCEU, man. What a turnaround. #Shazam is so good. I flat out belly laughed &amp; the action is awesome. @ZacharyLevi is perfect in every way!!"
"9331","Shazam was a lot of fun. Refreshingly succinct while still feeling epic. Very well done. Giving this one 5/5 magic wizards."
"9332","@ShazamMovie was just as I expected and such a good time! Everyone was cracking up in the theater. Loved the two younger actors and the Shazam role was perfect for @ZacharyLevi. Fun for all ages but definite must see family film :)."
"9333","What do you think about the movie:
#Shazam. I loved it"
"9334","Shazam was a bit more intense on the violence than I expected; it bounced between that and goofs.
It's a long ride but I had a lot of fun<U+0001F44D><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"9335","@KobesMindYT so you only want to see Shazam and Endgame?"
"9336","This say alot about society we reside in."

"9338","@AsherAngel just watched @ShazamMovie and absolutely loved it"
"9339","Shazam is the best movie out rn"
"9340","also I decided to see it at 10:30 on a whim and had to Run to the theatre and while running some guy shouted “where you running?”and in a moment of Pure Energy I yelled “SHAZAM” and it was great"
"9341","Shazam suffered a bit from having poor editing but was in general a lot of fun! Also, I will kill and die for the Marvelfam"
"9342","also the end credits basically had my Ideal Shazam Comic Aesthetic"
"9343","Shazam was a crazy movie. Honestly one of the most enjoyable ones I've seen in a while! #Shazam"
"9344","On a personal level... I got advanced Red Carpet Screening tickets to see Shazam. I was too late for it but the screening was the same Thursday that Captain marvel was released. I went to see Captain Marvel that weekend.  The audio in the theater wasn't very good. I complained."
"9345","AMC was nice enough to give me and my friends a re-admit pass that is equivalent to a movie ticket. I used that ticket to see Shazam. 

Wild. 
Or Ordinary. 
But Wild to me."
"9346","So, apparently Captain Marvel and Shazam will always be linked. 
If you didn't know Shazam was originally called Captain Marvel in the 1940's. Lots of shit went down and now it isn't. 
Djimon Honsou plays a character in both Shazam &amp; Captain Marvel. 2 different properties."
"9347","What’s a good movie site to watch Shazam on? <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"9348","***Spoilers for Shazam***

"9392","Caught the late show of Shazam tonight. Probably not one I'll show to my kids too soon. As much as I enjoyed it, which is a lot, there was a lot of darker and more serious content too. I feel like a few small changes could have made it way more family friendly."
"9393","@GodzillaMovie @IMAX You lied. It's not showing in front of #Shazam in IMAX."

"9435","The pearl clutching over Shazam's rougher scenes being too much for kids is funny because we stopped making live action superhero movies for kids a looooooooooong time ago. 

I get that the concept could make one have different expectations, but that ship sailed."
"9436","Takeover as the second best comic book movie franchise? Hope so"
"9437","Djimon Hounsou was great as the wizard who gives Billy Batson/Shazam his powers, &amp; Mark Strong was greatly sinister as the supervillain Dr Sivana. The other foster kids  (Mary, Darla, Eugene, &amp; Pedro) who live with Billy &amp; Freddy had a special role to play in the story as well."

"9461","Shazam is a recent shitty comic revamp of Captain marvel so of course it's finally the one comic they adapt almost verbatim"
"9462","Shazam pros:
It was a movie
Pace didnt feel rushed &amp; checklist ticking
The costume
The casting
The marvel family

Cons:
Lines came off very written
Dumbed down af
Cheaped out on individualizing the 7 deadly sins
Turned villain into a generic punching clone with no motivation"
"9463","To the solo moviegoer bathed in cologne to see Shazam tonight, you’re lucky I didn’t puke on your feet."
"9464","@TheComixKid I don't think a single human would want to see Shazam! when the greatest superhero film ever (and probably one of the best FILMS ever) is gonna open in 3 weeks :3"
"9465","So I watched #Shazam today and it's all right for a DC movie. It's very much a PG b/c it's about a kid becoming a superhero. But other than that, it's good"
"9466","So I watched #Shazam today. It's a all right DC comic movie. It's quite PG b/c it's about a kid turning into a superhero. Other than that, it's good"
"9467","85% of Shazam was great but... the BRUTAL violence and super jarring tone in parts was really off-putting. Be prepared for that if you're going to go see it."
"9468","@NicoleDuCane @TwitchCon Heck yeah! Also unrelated but true story I just got back from Shazam and did a double take cause I thought you were playing a character in it"
"9469","@jonathancovey @_RamonBravo i know we saw #Shazam yesterday but it’s kind of like one of the dreams you have where it’s so vivid but then you forget it the minute you wake up."
"9470","@Expanseshill I don’t see any disrespect. Not sure what your evidence of intentional disrespect would be.

Freddy adored Superman. Billy wasn’t as into heroes. But now Billy is doing this favor for Freddy, and it shows that Shazam has arrived as a hero too."
"9471","Wonder Woman 1984 finished filming by the end of 2018 when the first film came out in 2017. I say GO FOR IT"
"9472","Completely giddy walking out of a showing of @ShazamMovie , running around saying, “Shazam!” Congrats @wbpictures - you got this middle aged woman wishing she were a superhero <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F> @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel #captainsparklefingers"
"9473","Just saw Shazam. Fantastic movie with funny scenes and amazing action scenes"
"9474","Shazam was so freaking good. DC might have their shit together finally"
"9475","This is the best thing I’ve seen tonight next to Shazam!"
"9476","@IDS616 I haven’t seen Shazam but I can concur with the rest of the ordering of this list."
"9477","I want to Shazam and eat popcorn"
"9478","What? Since Ragnorak? That must be decades ago."
"9479","Shazam was an alright movie. It had good parts and bad parts. CGI was iffy, but it held it's own. Great performance by the cast though. Many good parts were ruined by bad placed jokes. Ruined a lot. Also very cliche. Movie was good but could be a lot better."
"9480","Also, apropos of nothing, but my GOODNESS did the Shazam marketing not really do it any favors. 

 That movie is all kinds of fun."
"9481","Shazam from the P <U+0001F525> <U+0001F525><U+0001F525>"
"9482","Shazam! Will forever be the biggest inside joke between me, my brother, and cousin <U+0001F62D><U+0001F602>"
"9483","Went to go see Shazam and let me tell youuuu it was lots of fun <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F920><U+0001F31A>"
"9484","@ShazamMovie @_jmarrero I'm going to see this today. I'm sure that it will be better than the trailers."
"9485","@SandyKenyon7 @ShazamMovie You FORGOT to say at the beginning that you are being PAID by Disney and can not say how great this movie is.  It has action, adventure, funny, and it made you cry a little, ALL the things you go to a movie for.  I know Disney will not let you say anything (ABC is OWNED by Disney"
"9486","#Shazam is awesome. #DC has officially fixed their sucky movie problem, and they did it by refocusing on they’ve always been best at, bold colors and clear virtues. About damn time."
"9487","Oh, and for the record? If you’re one those trying to somehow compare #Shazam to #CaptainMarvel ? Don’t be THAT GUY. They’re completely different movies, they’re both fckn awesome. Just let it be, Kay? Love-ya-smoochies."
"9488","Went to see #Shazam with @AhnaHyouki and @WishSkunk .  We all really liked it! <U+0001F600>"
"9489","@WatchYazz exactly 9/10 twitters wrong lol but i’m stuck between that and shazam"
"9490","@iDavey Wait what was that. Cuz I remember a Shazam movie or something with shaq"
"9491","Just watched Shazam, it's more of a comedy movie than a superhero one"
"9492","might fuck around and give shazam 5 stars"
"9493","I can't believe ""Suicide Squad is the most diverse superhero movie"" discourse is still happening on the tl when Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam exist."
"9494","My wife really in Shazam I'm so proud of her...."
"9495","Shazam rey be the best thing out DC"
"9496","@TheAstroPub can confirm, also saw Shazam with your wife. Would 100% recommend."
"9497","@ShazamMovie So great to watch and enjoy a movie with no PC undertones."
"9498","Zack Snyder needs to take a lesson from the crew at #Shazam. That’s how you make a superhero movie. It was a lot of fun."
"9499","@R3DB1RDR3VOLV3R @ShazamMovie I heard pretty good things about it. Might watch it during the week"
"9500","@ShazamMovie This is my most favorite superhero movie that I’ve ever watched. <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"9501","@t_visADL @ShazamMovie OH GOD YES EXACTLY!!! He’s really taken this wonderful universe into the shitter and they just keep letting him!!!! Hopefully with the commercial success of Shazam they’ll realize their Snyder crap fest isn’t what the public wants."
"9502","After watching @ShazamMovie I am completely and utterly convinced no one should let Zack Snyder near any super hero movie ever again."
"9503","Liked Shazam. A refreshing change of pace from the Marvel Movies. A nice, self-contained film. No need to be aware of a bigger plot or plan."
"9504","Thinking more about it, I think Shazam is my favorite movie in the current DC lineup. Sorry Wonder Woman."
"9505","Shazam might be one of my favorite superhero movies of all-time. From to bottom. 9/10."
"9506","Man... Zachary Levi really Murdered his portrayal. Great Acting from the beginning to end. #shazam"
"9507","For the 1st time I can honestly say I fucking loved a DC movie. If your on the fence for seeing shazam because DC usually sucks. Go see it. It was very marvel esque. Funny and full of great action. — watching Shazam! Movie"
"9508","@Variety If they named it The Marvel-ous Shazam, it would of made $150m. Might be sued, but its worth it."
"9509","So I know this is very late but I just saw Aquaman
It was not bad at all. Sure not perfect and some things that weren’t that great but overall pretty enjoyable and a step up from previous DCEU films. Can’t wait to see Shazam."
"9510","I noticed one of the covers to Shazam! is a slight spoiler whoops"
"9511","New Shazam was good. Suffers from pacing as there are a lot of characters at the beginning and some aren’t as fleshed out as others. Mark strong and Zachary Levi great as always. Video game references out of /10"
"9512","@jiminpearly @btsworIdwide @BTS_twt We have to watch like a normal human in YT amd donot click replay...but i guess @btsworIdwide  will give us proper streaming in YT.. And also we have to stream in spotify,shazam and request Their new song in radio station..we are fuckin busy next week...<U+0001F602>"
"9513","Finally watched Aquaman. Please tell me Shazam is better than that. Gorgeous movie, woooooooffff."
"9514","#shazam’s ending credits alone was a better Justice League movie than the actual #JusticeLeague movie. Definitely worth the watch!"
"9515","@Professorbroman Same my dude. Me and my daughter saw Shazam! tonight and it was pretty great. I recommend."
"9516","Shazam was pretty rad, thoroughly enjoyed it, I'm not usually a big DC fan but this got me"
"9517","@RayApollo I liked Shazam better than Wonder Woman. It is a great answer to what would happen if a kid got super powers"
"9518","Shazam was actually so funny, I was not ready for that <U+0001F606> I love you @ZacharyLevi"
"9519","saw @ShazamMovie today.. was 10/10 would definitely recommend and i really enjoyed the friendship between @jackdgrazer and @AsherAngel thank you that is all goodnight #asherangel #Shazam"
"9520","Shazam! &gt; every other DC movies that came before except maybe Wonderwoman"
"9521","@ friends why..."
"9522","@RaymondArroyo @madea @ShazamMovie You are such a vivid writer I can smell the pot on your clothes. <U+0001F61E>"
"9523","@RaymondArroyo @ShazamMovie Isn't that same variation of the movie the Somethingorothereds? The movie with the kid named Dash."
"9524","Shazam was a really nice movie :D<U+26A1>"
"9525","As much as I love Asher Angel because he’s so precious I really want to point out that his character as Billy Batson should’ve been livelier and more goofy? idk it kinda felt like him as a kid is more matured rather than when he’s Shazam. Although he was able to redeem it tho."
"9526","just saw shazam and i LOVED IT"
"9527","watched shazam and now my jack grazer obsession is back"
"9528","#shazam is everything you want it to be.   Fun from start to finish and @ZacharyLevi is a perfect Shazam, and the rest of the cast is amazing as well. I freaking loved it"
"9529","Is tht Henry Cavill playing Superman in the end of Shazam ? I’m getting a lot of hate cause I said it wasn’t Cavill @ManaByte"
"9530","i know it’s late but i loves shazam so much and i can’t wait to talk about it wirh everyone who’s seen it"
"9531","i know it’s late but i loved shazam so much and i can’t wait to talk about it wirh everyone who’s seen it"
"9532","@nulref I also liked BvS more than JL. At least it was one director's movie and not two plus a studio. I think DC is on the right track with tonality that fits the character subject. Shazam fits a humorous film, but I wouldn't want every DC movie to be a Marvel comedy. Joker is coming."
"9533","@ShazamMovie What if there was a hero that would get powers by shouting “NIGGA”"
"9534","So Shazam is an amazing and fun film please go see it"
"9535","Really ?"
"9536","Y’all, Shazam is my new fave thing"
"9537","There was a child in my screening of SHAZAM who was coughing so much and running around the theater that I‘m going to spend the rest of the week worrying that I contracted some terrible flu from them.

Also the movie is good!"
"9538","@DCComics @ponysmasher @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi was born to play #Shazam He fits the character sol well. @Jgrazerofficial is our the fans'-voice in the film.
@AsherAngel is comic-accurate #BillyBatson 
THIS MOVIE GETS EVERYTHING SOO RIGHT!!
Can't be more satisfied. <U+26A1><U+2665><U+FE0F><U+0001F918>"
"9539","@ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher  @ShazamMovie is soo Awesome. Beats all my expectations thru the roof!

"9540","@DCComics @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher @ShazamMovie not to forget the awesome credits animation...Imean wow...That itself is a short animated movie, one which we enjoyed a lot, especially the #Batman &amp; #Shazam segment <U+0001F609>
#ShazamMovie #dccomics"
"9541","@DCComics @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher @ShazamMovie is soo much rich in content...I didnt expected it to be this much. The writing &amp; script also deserves much appreciation. Coming out it was like I had a Thanksgiving dinner for my comic-fan brain. <U+26A1><U+2665><U+FE0F>
#Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"9542","@ShazamMovie Really well done movie.  Funny!  That last scene in the cafeteria was pretty awesome!  Loved it!"
"9543","@bobfreelander Is Shazam too scary for a wuss? I feel like my wife will love the fun stuff but I’ve heard having a horror director makes them lean very favorably into the demons. Assume that R is way braver than my wife."
"9544","Please go see Shazam! Great movies deserve to be seen"
"9545","SR: #shazammovie Plot: Big + Spiderman with just a dash of darkness. Chars: Billy is the main guy but it's really the Shazam show. Also, Freddy and the foster 4 make a fantastic steal. See it? Yes! Now! #gamedev #indiegame #movies"
"9546","Shazam and Pet Semantary tomorrow <U+0001F60D>"
"9547","omg shazam! is such a joy!  has dc finally learned what makes a successful superhero movie?"
"9548","Talking to No. 3 kid:

“Dad, I’m binging every Marvel movie on Netflix... can we go see the new Avengers movie!!”

“Heard it’s already sold out... how about Shazam!??”

“Huh?? What’s that??”

“Shazam! The movie!”

“You mean like the app??”"
"9549","Shazam! was hilarious, exciting, engaging, self-aware, and fantastically acted. The DCEU’s best film thus far. 7(maybe8inthefuturebutidkyet)/10."
"9550","Saw @ShazamMovie earlier today. Great and fun movie.  Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy is a delight. The whole casting is amazingly well done."
"9551","Shazam the best superhero EVER!!!!"
"9552","the highlights of today are going to be me seeing shazam and getting japanese good"
"9553","I just saw #SHAZAM! The movie is purely amazing I loved every second of it. Great director work! Can’t wait to see it again"
"9554","As someone who hasn’t been keeping up with DC movies, I thought Shazam was really good. Way better than most MCU movies imo.

It had an exciting plot, was actually humorous and didn’t force humor since it went with the story, and it was alienating unlike most of the MCU movies."
"9555","@ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher I just finished #Shazam and I loved it so much! I’m adopted myself and I feared ho when Billy looked his bio mother in the eye, and referred to his foster/adoptive family as his real family. Thank you so much for such an incredible film!"
"9556","Just watched #Shazam! 
Absolutely amazing!
Easily a 10/10, SO FUNNY! 
You have to go see it <U+0001F606>"
"9557","I appreciate @ponysmasher for making a movie about a hero with lightning that I can actually watch.  #ShazamMovie #seizureprobs"
"9558","@satinephoenix @kylevogt When my love and I went to see Captain Marvel earlier today there was a guy dressed up as Shazam taking pics with kids.. It was SO CUTE seeing all these little ones around the guy asking questions and the look of awe on their faces was priceless.. Lol"
"9559","Just got back from seeing #Shazam and all I have to say is the DCEU is already in a good direction since the beginning, there's nothing new except that Aquaman &amp; Shazam have their own identities you can change it up, but it's always been good since MOS"
"9560","@JacobMcMillan3 @GiteshPandya Captain Marvel hit billion below average or not you can’t dismiss that. I doubt Shazam will hold up because of competition. I hope it does because it was a great movie. But even if it does it ain’t touching captain marvel."
"9561","SHAZAM! was so good. DC really getting into the groove of things."
"9562","@JeffreeStar Just finished watching Shazam with my boyfriend and his bro <U+263A><U+FE0F> great movie!"
"9563","I can’t stop singing this <U+0001F602>"
"9564","OKAY. Shazam blew me away. I watched it exclusively because I adore Zach Levi but was not super enthused about another white bro superhero movie. Wow. Go watch it. Seriously."
"9565","Shazam is a good superhero movie ngl but there are some scenes that are too gorey for me lol"

Shazam!
Us
Pet Sematary
Captain Marvel

"9569","Even though I’m loyal to Marvel, I’ll admit that Shazam! was entertaining. I’d put it 3rd in my DCEU listing"
"9570","Shazam has that same problem that alita : battle angel has where the source material is 10x better than the adaptation. It’s okay movie to watch if you’ve never read a comic and get all your comic book knowledge from watching superhero movies from the past 10-20 years. #shazam"
"9571","Shazam has that same problem that alita : battle angel has where the source material is 10x better than the adaptation. It’s okay movie to watch if you’ve never read a comic and get all your comic book knowledge from watching superhero movies from the past 10-20 years."
"9572","#Shazam was fun.  A story told with magic and heart.  Some good laughs and a few scares."
"9573","After seeing Shazam, the long wait for WW84 by Patricia Lea Jenkins begins and can’t wait for more of Gal as Wonder Woman and the best Diana Prince/Wonder Woman ever, so glad that Zimmer is composing WW84, but also waiting for Joker."
"9574","Saw Shazam a month ago on a pre screening: seeing @ZacharyLevi and @Handlebrody in the same screen is what teenage nerd dreams were made of. Chuck x The OC"
"9575","Holy shit Zachary Levi who plays Shazam was in VGHS that’s so cool I used to watch those the day they’d upload"
"9576","seeing a lot of positive reviews for Shazam! kinda wanna watch it..."
"9577","#shazam is the movie I wish Man of Steel was."
"9578","What makes #Shazam a success is that it approaches the concept of being a superhero with genuine wonder and awe"
"9579","@DudesofCinema And it brilliantly keeps the focus of the film upon the Shazam characters while giving us teases at the greater universe within this world; the biggest lingering question- is this world the same as in BVS?

This could just be a world that merely seems similar on the surface."
"9580","Went to go see Shazam at 8:15, I slept through most of the movie, woke up at the end extremely hungry and tried to eat the rest of my popcorn before we left - thanks pregnancy <U+0001F605><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"9581","Who doesn't love double the paycheck? <U+0001F917>"
"9582","Shazam was really good. Like Spider-verse, you can tell the creators and actors were having fun with their movie. Now I have to wonder how the tone of the sequel would be if Black Adam (The Rock) is gonna be in it."
"9583","@ZacharyLevi Just took my 9 year old son to see @ShazamMovie.  He already loves you from @nbcchuck, now we shared @ShazamMovie, when he is a bit older I will show him @MaiselTV.  Thanks for continuing to be the bridge of joy to my boy! You are my hero! #ShazamMovie #goseeit #hero"
"9584","Omg me too i thought it's the opening of shazam? But later there's an advertisement that do not related to it. Creepy....."
"9585","So Shazam was great. Reminded me of Spider-Man Homecoming. Funny, great character development and meaningful. Highly recommend!"
"9586","Some ratings and reviews <U+2B07><U+FE0F> tell me what y’all think?"
"9587","Yeah...there's a lot. Shazam is one of them"
"9588","We must've watched different movies"
"9589","Shazam is the coolest super hero don't @ me"
"9590","I saw shazam. Was good enough. The endings implications though...
Heh heh heh"
"9591","Shazam was actually a fairly fun movie, biggest complain I’d say was the villain and their scene. Tonally just jarring"
"9592","#Shazam is a fun time at the movies. I had a blast."
"9593","The best part of @ShazamMovie was when suddenly “don’t stop me now” started playing, nothing else to say."
"9594","@ZacharyLevi I saw Shazam, and omg I love this movie. You play so good, I was a kid in front that.
I met you at the  comic con (first dream)
Saw Shazam with you like actor (2 dreams).
Thanks you very much !!!"
"9595","The movie Us was probably one of the worst movies I’ve seen in awhile. On another note Shazam was a 10/10"
"9596","@YahooEnt I loved spiderverse so much. Its one of my favorite superhero films. But, Shazam is way more diverse. Im a marvel fanboy n shit but I'm willing to accept the fact that Shazam was a great movie and was much more diverse than Spider verse"
"9597","so, I when with my wife and daughter to see #shazam, my daughter got scared in one part of the movie ( she is 5) but we all enjoyed it, great movie for all the family, fun, action, sad and scary moments, all well done and delivered, provably we will see it again in the week"
"9598","Saw #Shazam today. Great action, upbeat tone &amp; throws good misleading punches. Wish I didn't know Shazam's backstory, cause it would have been more enjoyable
I enjoyed it quite a bit, the comedy was occasionally hit &amp; miss but that's more to due with me being multi-cultural."
"9599","We aren’t doing a Shazam review this week, but all I gotta say is: Shazam and the theme of Home, Family, and Heart."
"9600","@IGN @Kojima_Hideo Nyeh. It wasn't so great. Typical clichés. Not so great acting in few places but only in beginning, then it improved. Still, the plot felt kind of flat (?) for me. Also, in my opinion, Zachary Levi didn't really fit in role of Shazam."
"9601","I just can’t get over the mid credit scene and the pre-credits scene on Shazam."
"9602","@ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @ShazamMovie just saw #Shazam &amp; loved it. I was all excited for tonight &amp; the movie didn’t disappoint."
"9603","Shazam was so fucking AMAZING.

It's my favorite dc movie of all time 

PLEASE let there be a sequel please"
"9604","@gracecfulton At 1:59:22 in Shazam!, you say “That’s racist” to Ian Chen’s character Eugene. What did he say? It’s been bothering me and my friends."
"9605","i truly would rather go to the electric chair than see this"
"9606","2/3 into Shazam and it started getting good for me. Meagan Good tripped me out tho. Havent seen her in an intriguing movie since Stomp The Yard. Lol"
"9607","Dear tito @JearDMC, I just watched #Shazam with papa and it was shamazing! You would’ve loved it. I wish I could watchit with you. I miss you. Everyday. I love you, always."
"9608","Shazam! and Into the Spiderverse have very similar energy, send tweet"
"9609","guys, I really can't stress enough how CUTE Shazam! was......
.....I kinda want to see it again???? 

defo did not expect that"
"9610","@ShazamMovie I really liked it!  Lots of fun.  Zachary Levi did a good job of being young inside."
"9611","I feel like I aged ten years sitting through Shazam it is so fucking long and terrible and I hate all of it it somehow did not make my growing list of movies I consider better than green book and that bar is next to fucking dinosaur bones"
"9612","Yo this show 'on my block' got my pulling shazam out every 5 minutes. Sound track is dope!"
"9613","Shazam was an outstanding movie I hope to see more of this coming from future DC films! Definitely headed in the right direction with this one <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"9614","gonna force my parents to watch shazam today, pray they say yes <U+0001F60B><U+270A>"
"9615","Shazam was actually pretty fun, which - given it's a DC film - is kind of hard to process."
"9616","When Superman shows up at the end of Shazam. That was my favourite thing in 2019."
"9617","#Shazam ""Finish him! Hey, I have the voice now."" Great movie."
"9618","@ZacharyLevi Saw #Shazam twice already. In 2D &amp; #3D<U+0001F60E>. <U+2764><U+FE0F>'ed it. The comedy in it was hilarious, the story was good, And the action was fun to watch. It's a #MustSee. I'm going to enjoy adding the @ShazamMovie to my #3DBluray movie collection when it release &amp; can't wait."
"9619","thats a very good feeling"
"9620","Shazam made me feel like a little kid again. Go see it. Please. DC needs to know THIS is the type of movie they need to be making, not Aquaman or BvS."
"9621","DCEU never focused their universe, and that’s why it flopped. Iron Man planted the seeds for Avengers, which introduced Thanos. DCEU wanted Marvel’s success so it went to Justice League ASAP. Aquaman + Shazam show it’s growth, but how is it going to reconnect to their failures?"
"9622","i give #Shazam a big thumbs up because that movie was great and hilarious"
"9623","Today i just went see awesome badass and funny movie which is #shazam"
"9624","@ZacharyLevi just wanted to say I loved the Shazam movie! Can’t wait to see you in another DC movie!!"
"9625","shazam is DC’s only good movie who wants to fight about it"
"9626","I just saw the movie bro how do you have such a shitty fucking judgement stop smoking dick"
"9627","after seeing shazam i can confirm that DC movies are bad and also an insult to society and i hate them with a passion thank u goodbye"
"9628","Shazam movie was a disappointment"
"9629","non-spoiler shazam thing: the running joke with the mall santa is one of the funniest things in the movie, imo."
"9630","Looks like I'm going movies every Friday for the rest of the month can't believe I forgot to go watch Shazam damn"
"9631","im a whore"
"9632","Shazam done which was amazing. Next is Us. Then Upin Upin with the monsters. What's next?"
"9633",".@ShazamMovie was awesome!!!! Great acting by @ZacharyLevi &amp; @Jgrazerofficial!"
"9634","Might be a cultural thing (Marvel was always far more available in Dublin than DC when I was growing up), but I have little to no idea who Shazam is."
"9635","Shazam! Review: 4/10 - It was good, but Billy didn't pay his foster parents rent so I didn't really enjoy it #Shazam"
"9636","Great Movie

"9637","Ah okay, so that's why I recognized the female scientist who worked with Dr Sivana in #Shazam . She was apparently David F Sandberg's wife. I've seen her in his horror movie shorts on YouTube. Only on the thumbnails though, I'm too much of a coward to watch them <U+0001F602>"
"9638","I've never seen The O.C. tv show, but I've seen the gifs sets and it just hit me. Ben McKenzie is James Gordon in Gotham FOX, and Adam Brody is in #Shazam . So I guess it's almost like a reunion even though they're in different universe, but they're both in DC stuff."

As a Snyder fan, it was disappointing to see the kid drop the Batman and Superman figures to watch Shazam but par for the course with WB <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"

"9674","This rain hard as hell. I’m bout to run outside and scream, “SHAZAM!” And see what happens"
"9675","(1) Shazam is the most boring movie I've ever seen, and I think it's the first superhero movie I've ever seen too. I was able to predict every joke, the main kid and the brother that tags along are annoying as hell, racist stereotype of Asian kid being good at games and hacking"
"9676","(2) I don't know the backstory of Shazam but if its anything like this movie then its PAINFULLY lazy. And the ONE joke I found funny, I only found it funny because it reminded me of a scene in IZ. I don't know who was behind the writing for the film adaptation, but fire them."
"9677","Shazam was delightful! Quite a few plot holes, but aside from that, a perfect movie! Props to the writers for writing such a great script. Also, does the Superman cameo mean the DCEU is still alive? <U+0001F914><U+0001F914> #Shazam #shazam #SupermanCameo"

"9686","""And Billy’s eventual meeting with his long-lost mother is painful, honest, and more grown up than anything the MCU has tackled. It makes Tony and Steve’s Civil War conflict look frankly immature. Shazam! isn’t afraid to get emotional, because children aren’t afraid of emotion."""

2. probably the most sincere superhero movie since Reeve's Superman... made by 2019 DC no less

"9705","@andrewbdyce Good way to put into words how I feel about Shazam!"
"9706","Shazam was very average at best. Had a great secondary plot, but felt like a movie that didn’t know where to focus. Storylines of villain and hero felt very forced and cheesy."
"9707","Just watched #Shazam and I really enjoyed it. There were funny moments and the story wasn't bad either. The villain was great imo. The kids were killed it too. Definitely recommend! #DC #DCComics #CaptainMarvel"

"9710","I just saw #Shazam and it was really great! I don’t even have a jokey review for it. It’s just a fun, funny movie, go see it! It’s like Diary of a Wimpy Kid, if Greg Heffley turned into a wizard."

"9724","Shazam! is probably more family friendly than many recent Marvel movies…  but I still preferred their Captain Marvel. Zach Levi is fun but he seemed like a different person to Asher Angel’s Billy. Sets up an interesting sequel premise. Overall, a solid 7."
"9725","@johndylena I'm so hyped. I never thought that we'd even get a Shazam cartoon, let alone a full-blown movie, and let alone a good movie. As a trans gal he's always held a special place in my heart so I'm glad to see that it's knocking it out of the park for so many people."
"9726","If I could retweet this more than one time I would not only do that but retweeted a million times!"
"9727","I just watched ""Shazam!"" It is excellent. Charaters are developed well. Story is deep. Villian is good. Themes are good, but the humor is weak, which is disappointing, since it is sold as a comedy. There are inconsistencies in the film."
"9728","The quality of DC films are getting more consistent, but ""Shazam!"" doesn't raise the standard of their films above Aquaman."
"9729","I told Jessica that I would rank the recent DC films:
1) Aquaman (9 out of 10)

"9837","@spookyxraccoon @BillyKidRadio @Potatweets_ Honestly? I wouldn't even want to see Shazam with you guys, if you can't be bothered to invite me in the first place.

"9844","#Shazam is a fun movie overall, but is often slow because of an excruciatingly boring villain and stretched out action sequences."
"9845","Just went to see Shazam. Wasn’t disappointed, unexpected twists towards the end which was foreshadowed in plain sight. Enjoyed it 10x more than Captain Marvel. Nicest shot is when he Shazams off the building after getting off the phone."

"9866","People preaching about ""diversity"" supporting #Shazam are hypocrites. Shazam had 4 Hispanic characters, yet only cast ONE Hispanic actor, opting to whitewash two (DJ Cotrona once again pretending to be Hispanic), and Mr. Vasquez played by a Samoan. Talk discriminating Hispanics!"

When everything else fails, there's always family."

"9909","@RPartible @ShazamMovie Yeah, it’s really frustrating when a movie like this gets ruined by awful dubbing. But to be fair, the Chinese translation of the movie’s dialogue wasn’t that good either. Therefore, the Chinese voice actors had some bad material to work with."
"9910","@RPartible @ShazamMovie But the good thing is Hollywood movies are released in two formats in China. One is Mandarin dubbing, the other is English audio with Chinese subtitles. So audience can choose the format they prefer."

"9931","I think Captain Marvel was a better movie (Not sure), but I'd rather rewatch Shazam than rewatch Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel benefited from the fact that it's connected to other MCU movies while Shazam's connections are mostly for comedic purposes"

"9941","#SHAZAM is a comedy based around the super hero premise. The action is great when it begins and reminds you of the Injustice games. After Wonderwoman and Aquaman this is another great stand alone movie from the DCU. Loved it."

But the positive themes: showing a bad mother who abandons her child for selfish reasons. Then two loving parents in a foster family pick up the slack - AND having that family fight evil together. Positivity returns to #DCU"

#Shazam"

"9952","#Shazam is a fun film. But it really is just that. DCEU has..eons before they'll come close to the emotional investment MCU propels you to make. The first and second act was fun and endearing. The last was..underwhelming. Very 80's."

"9972","Saw Shazam! It was enjoyable next to Wonder Woman! DC has a long way to equal Marvel. What is it? Is it a legitimate offering to some DC universe cinematic saga, narrative, that could, perhaps rival Marvel's? Tweaks are questionable, while comedic turns are hopeful trends."

"9985","I will not pretend to understand #Shazam's mythology beyond his general powers, but the movie is up there with Wonder Woman as one of those from DC that are actually good! Costume colors too bright for my liking. Cool storyline. Good humor. But too crowded in the end (4/5Scales)"
"9986","@AndrynCampos @GiteshPandya If MCU films like Incredible Hulk and Thor Dark World can land an 'A-' and Iron Man 2 and 3 an 'A' I'd say the same goes for #Shazam. I enjoyed it. 

If we take the time to pick these films apart, flaws can be found all-around. I try to appreciate them all.

No offense meant. <U+0001F490>"

"9991","Shazam was a great movie, but my favourite part will always be when they played Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now”. I may have stopped breathing for a few moments when I heard it. Very good song choice there @ShazamMovie. #shazam #dc #comics #queen #music @ZacharyLevi"

"9993","Do yourself a favor and don’t watch Shazam please"
"9994","@EddieSteak @Orangejoe82 I think DC is trying. They have been hit or miss. They didn’t do to bad with aquaman by what I heard and Shazam was good by what I heard as well. Just takes time and patience. I mean Shazam is C-list but they have to have big names to make the money. In time they will do more."

"10005","In Shazam the demon with the tentacle tongue was most definitely the sin of lust"
"10006","Apparently #SHAZAM is too scary for kids. Scares are healthy for kids. It raises the stakes and when the hero triumphs, in the eyes of a child they are even more heroic."

"10022","@aprilthegod @BossUbong @tolutezzy_ @qwinnie_lee @kingtanda @thepamilerin @Poshpresh @MercyNiola @Biisi96 @OlaTheOG @iamvictor__ Why does the lightning that turns billy in to Shazam grows him up to his full potential instead of just being a boy with powers"
"10023","Shazam is fun! Skillful balance of humor, flawed character's wish-fulfillment story, action (w/some surprisingly rough moments), &amp; good acting from both the adult and child cast. 

The 'finding a family' arc is a bit standard, but what's built around it makes up the distance."
"10024","Oh my my! Had a blast watching Shazam! @ponysmasher thankyou for doing justice to the character! Awesome performances by @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel and @jackdgrazer !"
"10025","So #Shazam now marks three cracking solo DCEU films in a row <U+0001F44F> could it finally be that Warner Bros have found their recipe for success?

And don't bother with the ""they're just copying the MCU"" shouts because that's just lazy &amp; frankly not true - ALL films are pretty formulaic."
"10026","I liked shazam but a few things are on my mind. He just seems to kinda bump into crimes a lot. Right place at the right time kinda thing. The writing seemed quite lazy at times (not as lazy as some other recent films, but still)."
"10027","@goldeneug @Mainterrio Look, i know you wat me to get sexually active, but what does it have to do with BvS being better than Shazam? I know you want to get some of me, baby boy, but you’re ugly. I’m sorry, it’s true. So: stop trying to me me go fuck."

"10034","@IGN Woah woah wait 51 million? On a weekend? That’s honestly shocking I mean the movie is pretty damn good (except for the Shazam costume it looks to much like a muscle suit to me his hands are just so tiny )"

"10041","Alright Shazam was fucking dope and my faith in D.C is restored"
"10042","Shazam! is proof we need to keep this trend of horror directors directing superhero movies going because there’s some legit terrifying sequences in this movie and I was not ready for it. Think the Doc Ock arms hospital attack sequence from Spider-Man 2. It scared me &amp; I loved it."
"10043","@DarkChief Did you know Shazam was the first comic book super hero character to a tv show. Also is captain Marvel talk about in this or not because? I know DC was the og to have the character."

I see what you did here, DC. Not bad, really not bad."
"10056","@Sydney_3G1C @IGN imo I'd have to disagree.

Shazam at it's core, is a movie about family values in the guise of a superhero flick which made it so interesting to me and why it didn't have as much action.

Capt Marvel is the same old hero story we've seen. I enjoyed it but it's really stale."
"10057","I wish you could shazam clothes"

"10082","@ShazamMovie I want to see #Pedro have his sexuality affect the rest of his life, like his weight, grades, etc... Which unfortunately  is a problem that affects a lot of lgbtqi+ teens, and then him overcoming these problems.

"10159","You don't understand how hype I am for this movie. I am the biggest Godzilla fanboy....so much so, I even enjoyed the Matthew Broderick movie, that everybody swears is God awful."
"10160","Duuuuude Shazam! was fucking awesome. First aquaman now this? I think DC’s finally found their footing. Can’t wait to see it again"
"10161","#ShazamMovie much, much, much better than #CaptainMarvel!

The hero is actually engaging and not a wooden cardboard poorly written mess. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FF><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FF><U+26A1> 

DC is heading on the right path. Hopefully Joker will be good."
"10162","just got back from watching shazam. this beats captain marvel which wasn’t even at a 9/10. but shazam. we out here with 39720/10 ladies."
"10163","Went and saw that Shazam! film and it's very, very silly indeed and aimed at a very young audience but it's also incredibly charming and sweet and difficult to dislike. Another positive portrayal of a foster family too - Hollywood's getting better at that at least"
"10164","i want to go see shazam. it looks funny i want to see a dc movie and laugh instead of feeling impending boredom within the first ten mins. ok sorry thats mean but the movies ive seen  were rlly boring"
"10165","@AGramuglia I liked alita, didn’t love it but it was enjoyable, Captain marvel was really fun, and I just saw Shazam and thought it was great and unique for a superhero film! Why can’t we just enjoy all three?"
"10166","I just love Freddy's commitment to find out Shazam powers, he did not even hesitate when he told the robbers to shot Billy in the face to see if he was bulletproof or if it was just the suit."
"10167","Shazam was a solid 8 1/2 rating I rec highly"

"10169","I'll admit to tearing up when I saw Mothra. <U+0001F622>"
"10170","The Shazam trilogy could just be about Billy and the Shazam family with Superman sprinkled in while Black Adam could be the big fight trilogy of Black Adam vs Hawkman(JSA), Black Adam vs Shazam, Black Adam vs Shazam &amp; Superman I'd see BA2/BA3 as a kind of part 1, part 2 deal"
"10171","But damn WB would have to Harry Potter the fuck out this Shazam/Black Adam franchise if they did because of the kids especially Asher Angel"

"10177","#Shazam is just incredible. It has a charm that not many films have. Heartwarming, sweet, extremely funny, and scary at times is what Shazam is. For the next couple of months we'll hear everybody shout: SHAZAM! My friends and I were doing it after it. 4.2/5 <U+0001F618>"
"10178","@TomTeachesGames Pet Sematary. I think I saw some of the Shazam TV show, but I'm in denial about that."
"10179","Just saw #Shazam and I loved every second of it. Was absolutely hilarious"
"10180","We loved the ending “a home is when you call it a home”"

"10185","@Cal21210 @The_Meatball_84 @BobDigi69 For the 'delicious slice of cake' known as Shazam, the Superman cameo was some sort of 'cherry on top' for DC fans and the general audience..."
"10186","@manishie_ @t_visADL @ShazamMovie Snyder only did good with 2 movies (300 and Sucker Punch) everything else is shit (yes that does include the sequel to 300)"
"10187","Shazam was really fun, favorite DC movie so far. Trailers did a good job of not spoiling everything. Kudos to that."
"10188","I saw Shazam so that you wouldnt have to thank me later"
"10189","#Shazam is in DC what #Deadpool is in Marvel . Besides that , what a great movie ."
"10190","I saw the Shazam movie and despite the villain having a blue eye and revolving around a kid in a adult’s body, not once did they make an undertale joke"

"10196","@ad_gunn I'm still tossing up whether to catch the 8:50 showing of Shazam! tonight..."
"10197","@12_5_99np I'd switch MoS and BvS and I'd also switch SS and JL. WW, AM and Shazam for me are ranked the same since I believe they all bring out their own strengths."

"10199","Billy Batson and Shazam really really really don't feel like the same person."
"10200","Saw Shazam!. For the most part, I enjoyed it. It kinda plodded a bit too much and until it really kicked into gear, it felt like the movie was trying to make me dislike the title character. Where it worked was when the characters were on the same page."
"10201","Shazam is a jerk, an ATM thief, and just all around fails to sell that ""Pure of Heart"" quality the film assures us by the conclusion that he definitely has. I understand he was a last-ditch attempt to name a champion, but c'mon."
"10202","Spoilers from here on out.

Neat things: 
After beating the film's big bad, Shazam passes the ""pure of heart"" test that Wizard Shazam failed to give him. This is treated like a joke.
The hero and villain both have shitty parents, emphasizing the villain had no excuse."
"10203","The absolute tone shifts in this movie are almost so abrupt this might be a negative point for some people, but I loved it.
The beer and strip club scenes are executed perfectly.
Darla honestly gets the best third act scenes.
Shazam's family figuring out he's actually Shazam"
"10204","Not so great stuff:
The villain lets Wizard Shazam live for no reason at all. This could have been hand waved away with throwaway dialog explaining he still wanted Wizard Shazam's powers and knew he couldn't force Wizard Shazam to give it to him, but I can only infer this."
"10205","Shazam was such a great movie, I highly recommend seeing it!"
"10206","@ashchanchlani @ponysmasher I know, for many who have not watched Shazam there is much more to the movie than the trailers...also it's a little dark like traditional DC films....Not a fan of DCEU but loved it....Trailers do not justify the film...don't believe me go to rotten tomatoes and read other reviews"
"10207","@12_5_99np I know where talking about new dc but..I would put since i grew up with the tim burton batmans that is  number one to me.. then its Shazam then its wonder woman. then its squad then its justice league. then AM.. and sadly man of steel last i never really much a fan of superman.."

"10210","Who else going to see Shazam"
"10211","SHAZAM! is an utter delight. Tickles  the superhero fan funnybone and plucks at the exact right heartstrings. 

Might be a bit cynical for purists but it'll be offset by some great deep cut comic references."
"10212","@kirstiealley Watching bad movies. Shazam awful. Almost asked for my money back."
"10213","@_PVRCinemas more ads than the movie itself. Even the television has a limit. Why watch unnecessary ads when we come to watch movie. I am watching ads since last 15 minutes now and nothing can stop me frm not buying even a single of those brands. #pvr #ShazamMovie @prasoonjoshi_"

"10232","Shazam was quite enjoyable. It reminded of the film I used to watch as kid. I think that’s what they were going for."
"10233","Lets just say I sometimes see my colleagues espouse stuff that isn’t always great out of currying favor or loyalty. You know, it is what it is. But Shazam! is the real deal. One I’ll revisit often."
"10234","@JustCallMe_Mont @Melvingordon25 Judging a book by its cover eh. #Shazam is brilliant. Storytelling, diversity, great acting, family and love, fun and scares - it has it all... Hope you catch it. It is a great watch."
"10235","Wow Shazam really just decided to be the best DC film!"
"10236","Just saw Shazam and i got one bone to pick. Seriously? not one ""Captain Marvel""? Not even one? They reference captain america in the movie and them trying to come up with a name is a running gag, but not a single captain marvel joke? You had one job!"

"10248","Just finished watching Shazam. Pretty lighthearted movie for DC and that's a good thing.

They're usually dark and gritty, but this one is fun and happy.

Definitely recommend watching it."
"10249","@damonalfero @MTLSaiyan ... I like Strong and thought he did well. Also, I am pretty much on the opposite of the other things. I did like the kids, I liked Billy, I liked the build up to Shazam. It was not perfect, by any means, but I had a great time watching it. The theater I was in had laughs &amp; it..."
"10250","Shazam! Was pretty good. It's a very different take on the average superhero origin story, and one that made me smile, a lot. Imagine a quirky family comedy starring a superhero that still manages to really work. The first act was *real* rough, but the finale was dope. 

7.75/10"

"10261","I went to see the new  #ShazamMovie Saturday. 
Funny, Entertaining and Electric"
"10262","Outside of Batman 2 and WW, I’ve not been a vocal advocate of DC Films. Saw Aquaman last night and it was good.

But, Shazam was hype for me and I was not disappointed. So much feels, so much family. Thank you DC. I LOVED @ShazamMovie"
"10263","SHAZAM was very good and it makes me want a live action Batman: Brave and the Bold so much more."
"10264","Shazam is literally the worst superhero movie"
"10265","I’ve realised the big problem with #Shazam is this. If moody, sullen, guarded and violently defensive Billy Batson, traumatised by the loss of his parents, really got an adult body and super powers, he wouldn’t be the character Zachary Levi plays. He’d be Ben Affleck’s Batman."
"10266","Why would a kid who’s obsessed with this lifelong detective mission to find his lost mother use his new found superpowers to buy beer and look at strippers? It’s a huge character and plot gulf, although to be fair I didn’t consider it during the movie #shazam"
"10267","thoughts on the movie?"
"10268","First chuck, loved that show and now the #ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Shazam was awesome and hilarious <U+0001F923> especially the ending"
"10269","@chicle_247 Was Shazam good? It looked cringe by the trailer but it’s his character so I’m not judging"
"10270","@noobde @ShazamMovie @NetherRealm I thought launch Xbox ones couldn't stand vertically? Or were even being sold anymore, how the heck did they get one?"
"10271","So, I've watched Shazam and it's actually a good movie. Only criticism is that the story took a while to build."
"10272","@CoolB I know next to nothing about Shazam, apart from what's gleaned from the trailer, &amp; the old TV show, lol, so it's not a high priority."
"10273","@mydicktrash Lol ya man it's dope saw new movie Shazam tonight, was amazing, how's the new city treating you? haha"
"10274","My friends just realised that Shazam is an acronym for the gods i want to death"
"10275","@manthx @BobDigi69 I'm happy to explain why. Man of Steel to me is the perfect Superman movie. I love how it's shot, I love what it explores. Shazam is akin to Power Rangers, which I grew up with, and has a massive heart. SS shows convicts/felons are human and shouldn't be treated as dirt."
"10276","Long, productive day but I feel atrocious. I need to see Shazam again. I think that it's going to become a comfort movie for me when things are tough."
"10277","@ZacharyLevi Just saw #Shazam and LOVED it! Congratulations on getting to play such an iconic superhero!

If there's anybody that deserves to get to play a superhero, it's you.

"10283","@AdrianCikguTeoh @greentauros @DDayCobra It's a joke, Adrian. It's a mix of Jussie Smollet's bullshit claim of assault and a minor feud between DC Comics and Marvel fans (Shazam - the super hero - was/is called Captain Marvel, just like Marvel's ""Captain Marvel"")"
"10284","@MiaSanKroNoS @DiscussingFilm Introduce Black Adam in Shazam 2 and have Black Adam the solo film after. That way Dwayne gives S2 a boost and BA carries that hype over."
"10285","#Shazam is a glorious throwback of a movie. Equal parts 80s-coming-of-age and 00s-superhero-satire, it hits a new high for the genre.
Zachary Levi leads the film well, but the younger cast makes the movie. By the end, those adorable kids will have you grinning like a giddy idiot."

 They enjoyed it but certain parts of it scared the crap out of them.  Be warned if you're taking young kids to see it!"
"10329","Off to see Shazam in a bit. I need some easy Sunday viewing. And a large cup of tea."
"10330","By the Shazam is just funny. Nothing more. And that post credit from DC is just trash!"
"10331","And now I’m learning the mates here are talking about how I can’t possibly leave. I wonder how long until they realize all I really do is gossip with Ray, go on Twitter, and Shazam the music. Hell I’m on Twitter right now y’all"
"10332","Superheroes are going stale. I'm bothered by not being bothered to check out Captain Marvel or Shazam."
"10333","I have to be consistent with excercising, and all someone else has to do is say shazam. smh"
"10334","@trueOcuAlister @butterbarr @ponysmasher @benwallfisch The true fans of man of steel wants to know why wasn't Hans iconic superman theme was not used in Shazam even when you have honoured a lot of what happened in DCEU"
"10335","I don't understand what to do ?! Do we just keep shazam-ing it"
"10336","I just watched #Shazam. @jimmyfallon does great in the movie"
"10337","@ZacharyLevi is the man and Shazam was an awesome and really fun film! Hope there's more coming"
"10338","watching shazam in a few minutes but i just want to sleep..."
"10339","I thought Thor Ragnarok is the most entertaining superhero movie of all time.

Until I watched Shazam."
"10340","I like Billy and Freddie's interactions! #Shazam"
"10341","Saw today #ShazamMovie and really loved the work of @ZacharyLevi, I think you are going to be a great part of the DC cinematic universe, and having @RealJohnGlover appear was super awesome! Congrats guys! A hug from <U+0001F1F2><U+0001F1FD>"
"10342","so does anyone wanna go see shazam with me because im lonely &amp; need an excuse to go see it again"
"10343","I just got back from Shazam, and wowie I loved it."
"10344","I went to see Shazam 2 days in a row bc the guy I wanted to see it with didn’t see my message but this dude who I don’t like but I’m too nice to say anything asked me to it first so now I only have $1"
"10345","@RossButler being in #Shazam was a surprise!!"
"10346","@PvtCowboy113 And the reason they compare them is because Shazam! was called Captain Marvel at one point in the comics. Long story."
"10347","The DCEU fandom has potentially put me off from seeing SHAZAM! in a theater tbh."
"10348","In the session of #Shazam crowded where I was, people freaked out, laughed, thrilled and at the end of the day applauded him <U+0001F44F><U+0001F632> <U+0001F602><U+0001F62D><U+0001F917><U+0001F60D> the mix of feelings that this film provokes is surreal, it will surely enter the list of many favorites @ponysmasher YOU ARE THE BEST !!!"
"10349","Gonna go see Shazam in the movie theater with 2 friends today Pog"
"10350","@Hauwa_ibS @SaiduML You people will just come and be spoiling films for people. I'm going to spoil Shazam for you all who haven't seen it."
"10351","this is what I meaaan"
"10352","man, Warnee Bros shld invest in these DC superheroes/villains origin movies! these are what they supposed to do BEFORE handing over Justice League. Shazam was a feel good movie, really explains the backstory of Billy Batson and Shazam, and the whole Shazam Family."
"10353","As I said earlier, #Shazam is 3 day story in china. sunday is heading towards 5-6M.
Now lifetime will be below 45M. again a huge disappointment."
"10354","@Stemot1978 I relish the failure of Shazam.."
"10355","@lennymasha yeah just Shazam and Joker this year. WonderWoman 1984, Birds of Prey (Harley Quinn) next year. Batman, Suicide squad 2 2021, hopefully more in between."
"10356","@lennymasha Yeah they're getting a younger Batman, but I don't see the point of a Batman movie unless they want to reboot the whole Justice League idea, since we already have a glimpse of Superman in Shazam."
"10357","Keepin' the lights on in the house is all part of the job!"
"10358","Gays we just watched shazam and im so fucking happy IT WAS AMAZING"
"10359","Did I just book for two movies back to back? Yes. Yes I did.

"10366","Now I understand why david elrich’s mentioned shoplifters on shazam’s review <U+0001F914>"
"10367","Shazam was ok nothing out of the ordinary. Captain Marvel was better than Shazam. Aquaman was the best out of the 3 I recently watched. Super hyped for Endgame. Thank goodness we got tickets early. Can’t wait to watch it with my homeboys."
"10368","Seeing @RossButler in Shazam in a super suit <U+0001F61B><U+0001F61B><U+0001F61B> highlight of my day"

"10370","#ShazamMovie is Entertaining from beginning to end, it will undoubtedly remain my favorite movie of the year, @AsherAngel &amp; @ZacharyLevi are the billy batson and captain marvel we deserve."
"10371","@mrsundaymovies Do you think that Shazam is the first of a DC rebrand? #weeklyplanetpod"
"10372","@VueHelp I’m trying to book tickets for Shazam in Westfield Stratford on Saturday but it’s not showing times past Thursday... when will they be up? Or is Shazam only showing until Thursday? If so, very disappointing."
"10373","@ygent_official @YouTube BLINKs pleaseee download SHAZAM and stream the song there, SHAZAM plays an important role in billboard charts, if we want to make it rank higher on hot 100 we should stream on SHAZAM. it allows you shazam songs while listening to them on spotify and apple music."
"10374","How can I be connected to the aux and playing a tune and my homie starts using Shazam instead of just asking me for the name, almost gave him 5 consecutive slaps, like bro just ask smh"

#Shazam #DC"
"10379","No need to worry about this #DC movie, #SHAZAM is really fun with some good feels too. You won't be disappointed! @ZacharyLevi thanks for being the happy superhero we've been wanting. Great kids cast too. #shazammovie @DCComics @wbpictures"
"10380","someone’s playing music really loud outside and i can’t even be mad because the song is good and i’m made that i couldn’t shazam  it"
"10381","Eerie is hella overrated. Bland storyline and cheap jumpscares. 

Shazam was quite alright for a kids’ film. Goofy and fun."
"10382","Stay pressed baby #BRIELLION"
"10383","When I first read @geoffjohns &amp; @1moreGaryFrank #Shazam I thought 'you could adapt this shot for shot and it'd be a great movie' 
Turns out I was right. Shazam! rules."
"10384","Had a great time w extremely dear friend at #Shazam then went and caught up over a few schooners ( this dude is one smart hilarious bastard ) then I pedaled pissed to get a burger but now I'm home feeling utterly bereft and alone. You think the depression is gone then WHAM ouch"
"10385","I was completely wrong about #ShazamMovie I went into it fully expecting it to suck. I was dead wrong. GO SEE SHAZAM."
"10386","@BillyT800 Agree it’s a stacked month with Dumbo hellboy and endgame maybe WB should’ve brought Shazam out in march would’ve gave it room to grow."
"10387","Shazam is good you all and especially the ending"
"10388","@UberFacts Suicide Squad , Batman vs Superman .. The whole DCEU .  except Shazam"
"10389","Clear a room with one passing of gas...oh they already do that."
"10390","Do you know how many songs I’ve ended up letting go of just cause Shazam didn’t want to tell me the name"
"10391","Shazam was better than expected. Didn’t realise it was DC so nearly left after seeing the logo, but a super fun mostly light super hero movie"
"10392","should I take charles' advice ...and go see Shazam ?????..."
"10393","Really excited to go and see #Shazam! from @DCComics at the cinema. It looks like so much fun and a really positive superhero movie. Something much needed in these difficult times @ShazamMovie"
"10394","It's the last day of #SPRINGBREAK and I'm dying. Maybe I'll go to the movies to see #SHAZAM. Maybe I'll be mysteriously sick tomorrow."
"10395","Shazam! is great fun once it gets going: once we get past the origins exposition. Then, having grabbed our attention it 'settles down' where the film needed to be funnier and more action-packed. The second act of the film is really good; The first and final sections too long."
"10396","Shazam is definitely not a superhero movie..it’s a family movie and I’m okay with that!!!

Great heartwarming movie for everyone!!!"
"10397","Radio, which massively helps song charting, will have a better start this time

BUT what they look at to decide if it continues includes Shazam, Sp0tify, A99le, &amp; song purchases

Let’s push hard on audio streaming, esp US fam. It’s a critical marker of industry success. @BTS_twt"
"10398","That wind was mad last night. I just finished seeing Shazam and as soon as I stepped out, the wind started around 10mins to 11pm. I drove through it like crazy. I just knew that it’s aftermath won’t be pleasant."
"10399","@HarleyMovieNews My favorite is dark knight I just like that movie but Shazam was amazing I really liked it and aquaman"
"10400","Thought I'd do a thread on what I got up to yesterday. So I got all four schedules, the QFT only really had one movie I was interested in so that put some limits, like I couldn't do four new releases. I knew I wanted to do Shazam! &amp; Captain Marvel"
"10401","And that I wanted to do Shazam first so it wasn't having to deal with comparisons with CM. CM's been out a while so it had very few screenings at cinemas 2 &amp; 3. Put Pet Sematary in the cinema 2 slot to break up the superhero movies."
"10402","We want to make clear that we are not DC hater as some DC fans are saying..

Shazam is good movie but the collections are really low and prediction is done on the basis of it's buzz and opening weekend performance."
"10403","@Kable_HC @Nic_Baritone Aquaman wasn't bad...I just wasn't pulled in like I was with WW and Shazam. Mainly because of them trying to separate it from their dying universe. 

I'm gonna give it another shot though."
"10404","@Kable_HC @Nic_Baritone I was about to be offended, but I notice you don't follow me. <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>

But yes. Very much so follow comics. 
DC movies are just hit and miss with me. Not saying Marvel is vastly superior....but DC is just struggling to find their spot. But with WW and now Shazam, they're getting it."
"10405","@DevanTHoward Eh.
She has strength, durability and flight/speed.
But everything else Shazam has isn't shared. She's not invulnerable (she was as the God of War though). She can't manipulate lightning. But in current continuity her power limit is unknown, as her twin brother has diff powerset"
"10406","@TalkNerdyWithUs @TheIanChen @NerdLadyAllie @ShazamMovie @FreshOffABC What a HUGE day today (April 5th) is for @TheIanChen! The airing of the <U+0001F4AF>th episode of his groundbreaking sitcom #FreshOffTheBoat on @ABCNetwork AND the wide release/Opening Day of his @DCComics blockbuster film #Shazam<U+26A1>!!! Big congrats to this talented young actor!<U+2763> #Fresh100"
"10407","That was stupid amounts of fun, which also included two delightful performances from two of my fave network TV kids (Evan from Fresh Off the Boat and Annie from This is Us). #Shazam"
"10408","Well I thoroughly enjoyed #SHAZAM . Not what I expected at all. Very enjoyable. 8/10 Beards"
"10409","But for real i thought it'll be going Shazam vs Black Adam.

Turns out...

Well, you just have to watch uwu"
"10410","@deadletterpoets I loved both movies for different reasons shazam was a really fun movie about family and captain marvel was a really fun movie set in the 90s about finding yourself both are great in thier own way"
"10411","shazam is the first superhero film I can remember that had like...an awesome ending fight?? Like I wanna watch the film again basically bc the last 3rd is really good that's insane"
"10412","anyway the most unappreciated joke I've ever made is pointing to my wonder woman bag and saying 'hey do you like my shazam merch???' so jot that down"
"10413","Na rain here for Lagos for more than an hour now and no wind at all <U+2601><U+2614><U+2614><U+2614><U+2614><U+2614><U+2614><U+2614>"
"10414","the ‘Die Hard’ of our time"
"10415","If u liked #Shazam i would recommend  reading the new 52 by @geoffjohns its what the movie was based on for the most part and its great"
"10416","Wicked wind.  Carried all the tank and dropped them in a class."
"10417","Morn time people. That means I’m headed to RolePlay (what I do first thing everyday btw) but I also will get right on with working on stuff so I can do Purity and Blaze replies later. May try to come around here before I see Shazam later.

Oh, and imma do da irresponsible <U+0001F643>"
"10418","This upsets me"
"10419","@Overleague2 Yeah. I watched Shazam. I'm making a Quick Movie Review of it right now. 
I'll be sure to give Spiderverse a watch soon."
"10420","@thisisinsider @ShazamMovie DC sued Fawcett comics, not Shazam. The character is Captain Marvel. The movie is called #SHAZAM because of a different lawsuit between DC and Marvel."
"10421","Shazam sucks. I shouldn't have watched this"
"10422","“Lay your hand on my staff and say my name” in Shazam didn’t sound right."
"10423","@AaronMeyers Honest question. Is Mary Marvel still called Mary Marvel when Captain Marvel is called Shazam?"
"10424","the hoodie in the second one really ain’t it"
"10425","@monty391 @LexG_III One of the kids in Shazam was pretty heavy and I was happy to see that. Heavy people deserve to be treated like normal human beings."
"10426","@LandonOLeary @wbpictures @ZacharyLevi Superman vs Shazam , make it happen! @wbpictures @WBHomeEnt !!! #superman #Shazam"
"10427","Similar to my feelings, regarding #WonderWoman and #Aquaman, I enjoyed how the filmmaking team, behind #SHAZAM, leaned into the source material.  Diana, Arthur and Billy’s cinematic monomyths captured the spirit of their comic book archetypes."
"10428","Kudos to @ponysmasher for a delightful film.  I especially enjoyed the ibistick easter egg in #SHAZAM.  It makes me wonder if Amentep (Ibis the Invincible) and his soulmate, Princess Taia of Thebes, will make an appearance in future #ShazamMovie sequels."
"10429","I also enjoyed the Ibistick easter egg in #SHAZAM.  It makes me wonder if Amentep (Ibis the Invincible) and his soulmate, Princess Taia of Thebes, will make an appearance in future #ShazamMovie sequels."
"10430","My only small wish for #SHAZAM was for the primary setting to be Fawcett City, rather than Philadelphia.  However, it appears that the source material was #TheCurseofShazam, where the main story is set in Philly.  Seeing someone listen to podcasts from WHIZ radio would be cool."
"10431","In other news, I’m completely obsessed with @ZacharyLevi #ShazamMovie"
"10432","i’m so mad i couldn’t replay some scenes from shazam like please i want to see it AGAIN"
"10433","Shazam is the final proof to never let reviews sway you, watch the movie yourself ....last time I actually trust the reviews"
"10434","@thomasp0003 Spider-man 2 break shazam in every way shazam is just a good moment with super hero comedy and thats all i don t understand why you compare them ? Maybe some scene are similar but spider-man 2 is an excellent movie shazam is just a good moment thats all"
"10435","But is it going to be complete reboot?"
"10436","geoff’s shazam run has been great so far and it’s only 4 issues in, never called him a c*nt ever he’s my bff &lt;3"
"10437","Shazam and Zac Levi fans, we have been given an awesome movie. Let's give back. I encourage you to donate to Operation Smile, a wonderful organization that is near to Zac's heart. He gave his all; let's give back. If his 1 mil follow gave $5 each to Oper Smile that's $5 mil to OS"
"10438","On the way to see Shazam!. Passed a pair of discarded boxer shorts in the middle of the road. Not even at the side. Right on the centre line.

Oh, Birmingham. Never change."
"10439","Weee're off to see the wizard!
The wonderful Wizard Shazam!
Because he is a bit of a Wiz,
If ever a wizard ... am?"
"10440","Oh, one more thing I liked abt Shazam is how it started its story with introducing the villain’s backstory. And in doing so, did not to romanticize that specific subplot."
"10441","Oh, one more thing I liked abt Shazam is how it started its story with introducing the villain’s backstory. And in doing so, they didn’t have to romanticize the nemesis’s decision to antagonize everyone."
"10442","At the flicks with no. 1 son to see #Shazam. Politics and politicians can go fish up a tree for the next couple of hours."
"10443","[TR] Tam bi zaman kaybi..
[ENG] If you wanna waste of your time so go to the cinema and watch #Shazam"
"10444","Saw @ShazamMovie last night, would love to hear @jameelajamil thoughts about how the ideal man in this film doesn't include disabled or fat bodies..."
"10445","I'm sorry but I think the latest version of Shazam is not better than the already trash Shaq version. I'm no movie critic but i wasn't amused. #sorrynotsorry"
"10446","Shazam is the best DCU movie since the Nolan Batman movies. #Shazam"
"10447","oh and the ending of shazam is pure sex"
"10448","You all annoying"
"10449","I watched Shazam yesterday and it's been a while since I've walked out so pumped and happy after watching a superhero movie. Definitely recommend to give it a watch! I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"10450","@Partizan_Niksic People claiming that suit is coloured better in Shazam than in josstice...
Yeah nah, it's not even the same suit in Shazam. it's some bootleg copy."
"10451","im home and i really enjoyed shazam!"
"10452","@BubKebab i really wanna watch it i havent seen any capeshit that came out in the past 10 years and shazam seems really fun and it's the only instance of flossing in a movie that doesnt wanna make me gouge my eyes out"
"10453","I mean....the trailer was enough to understand that the movie was boring"
"10454","Instead of going to lubao ibmf we chose to watch Shazam! Good choice though <U+263A><U+FE0F><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"
"10455","@Manvendra_CBO Shazam is not doing well in China sadly"
"10456","@letstalkaboutDC I wonder how many general audience members had no idea what they were looking at when the Wizard showed that visual of past mistakes. I got all excited to see that scene. #Shazam was loaded with those details."
"10457","@Mjason86 @jinnie_jiang @gavinfeng97 4. I saw the movie. It had enough family cross-talk to make it clear the kids and adults were trying to make Billy feel welcome.

3. Maybe.

It is not working in China. 61 other markets, Shazam is #1. Or did you miss that Deadline update?"
"10458","@ZacharyLevi I just saw Shazam last night!!!! You killed it! Loved the movie!"
"10459","Finally, #DC caught up to #Marvel with #Shazam (the original #CaptainMarvel)!! This or the Flash movie should’ve been the first from DC roster
#DCUniverse #BillyBatson #Superhero #Comics"
"10460","Shazam was so funny and they were all so adorable im about to adopt all of em bruh"
"10461","Who would’ve thought they would introduce Captain Marvel awesome family aka Shazam family and Captain Marvel entry in Justice League in a single movie. 
@ShazamMovie #SHAZAM"
"10462","@manishie_ @ShazamMovie Man of Steel is a masterpiece, Batman VS Superman was WAY underrated (the extended edition). Snyder was a WRITER and a PRODUCER for Wonder Woman and we all know how awesome that movie was. Justice League was cut to ribbons by WB so we never got to see the Snyder cut. Ease up fam."
"10463","I enjoyed Captain Marvel and I enjoyed Shazam! Apologies for not trying to start a fight about it."
"10464","Just watched Shazam! Giving it a 6.8/10... Pretty fun movie."
"10465","Saw the real Captain Marvel. It was awesome. The best DC film since the Dark Knight Rises. Solid A. Go see #Shazam #shazammovie"

Loved it. Story is all about the every child's fantasy of becoming a superhero.<U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A>"
"10470","Shazam was a really unique superhero movie with 'Family' as it's central theme. Really enjoyed the performances of @ZacharyLevi , @AsherAngel and all the other kids and supporting cast.

The magic aspect of the movie was really something special.

Thank you @ponysmasher!"
"10471","I wish I could say 'SHAZAM' and turn into an adult...

Wait a second, I AM an adult."
"10472","@lenguy4 @IGN Saying Shazam and CM were equally as good is an insult to Shazam."
"10473","Dear Bloggers who know nothing about Comic Books but write articles about their movies anyway, 

SHAZAM (Captain Marvel) used to sell more comics then SUPERMAN! 

STOP CALLING HIM A B-LIST HERO! 

Sincerely,
From those who actually know his real name and his comic book history"
"10474","This simultaneously Great and Terrible at the same time"
"10475","@Partizan_Niksic Who cares?  Shazam was the last movie I cared for because of personal reasons.

"10490","Shazam was pretty good. 
A good, light hearted coming of age story. Reminded me of tobey maguire's spiderman a little. glad DC didn't make another gritty reboot story and is making way for more inclusive family fun"

As for the Shazam/Captain Marvel comparison, the two movies are different flavors of fun. I agree that there’s no need to force a rivalry, they can both be enjoyed equally."
"10502","Why are ppl posting pics of that cameo in Shazam? Some ppl still haven't seen it yet ffs."
"10503","@CJLLonewolf @ShazamMovie We got similar rankings. Think I got SS over Justice League though. Really cool seeing someone else appreciate Man of Steel as much as I do for the excellent film that it is. For me, hands down an all time CBM.

"10666","Shazam was quite entertaining! Was a fan of Chuck so I watched it primarily for @ZacharyLevi If you guys found him really funny, it’s because he really is. Talented, and super cute! <U+263A><U+FE0F>"
"10667","VERDICT: SHAZAM
90%
Lovely movie 
Love the CGI for the deadly sins

Next movie to watch, HELLBOY

"10670","#SHAZAM was great and very funny! Highly recommended!"
"10671","But other than the fact that Zachary is really cute, #Shazam was a good movie with a good message. There is a hero inside all of us. It was funny and it had heart."

"10676","@nexuspong Didn't really notice that. Wasn't bothered that it's not there though. There were a lot of people in my screen that quite quickly recognised Shazam is a DC film; reason -- WB logo. SMH."
"10677","@Josh2Gud4U Coz the scene, while well-intentioned, is pathetic. Anyone who  knows Cavill's physique can tell it wasn't him. And that goddamn '78 theme (which, spoiler: is also a part of Shazam's theme for some reason; plays again right before the end-credits scene). <U+0001F612><U+0001F623>"

"10718","@khoulgi_ @n_spidey fully disagree, DCEU (except MoS, and most likely Shazam) and GL were trash but DC animated movies are great and TDK trilogy is the best superhero trilogy. Star Wars will 100% always be my answer here, plus I don’t think it’s just movies"
"10719","@PlaystationBrah @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @captainmarvel @ThePSBrahs @ThePSBRAHcast @The_BRAHNation @3rdWheelArcade Had a lot of fun with Shazam! I'm a big fan of Zachary Levi <U+0001F601>"

The reboot has begun"

"10723","I need a Supes to interact with my Shazam <U+0001F614>"
"10724","There's a surprise in Shazam that I never thought I'd see in a movie. I won't spoil it, but he's one of my favorite comic characters ever. There he was, as ridiculous as ever, and I lost my shit. LOVED it. Still can't believe it. Stay after the credits."
"10725","my Top DC Movies

1. Aquaman
2. Wonder Woman
3. Shazam!
4. Man of Steel

and then the crap etc."
"10726","@HaydenJEpperley @donoDMG1 Depends on how we define diversity. Black Panther’s characters are overwhelmingly Black/Wakandan. But by actors’ nationality, the leads are: American, Kenyan-Mexican, British, South African, Guyanese, &amp; Tobagonian. IIRC, save Mark Strong and Djimon Honsou, Shazam is all-American."
"10727","Yes, Zack Snyder's Superman was a good movie, but compared to Shazam, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, I have to say those movies are far better. If you watch Richard Donner's 1978 Superman, it is better than Man of Steel. WB needs to make Superman a billion dollar movie."
"10728","Enjoyed such a well made movie full of heart <U+2665><U+FE0F>. You can’t get more loving than this with characters brought together from diverse cultures. Bravo @zacherylevi for you and the cast bringing these characters to life! This role was made for you! The symbolism of Good vs. Evil <U+0001F44A>"
"10729","@ZacharyLevi I loved Shazam!!! You were perfect! It was such a blast from start to finish! Superman/Wonder Woman are pretty much the only DC comic books but now I may have to check this one out(after I see this movie again of course)! Great job can’t wait for the sequel!!<U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"10730","It seems the best bits are in the trailer.  #Shazam"
"10731","@ArmyBrigade13 @BTS_twt Finally..it works. Thanks<U+0001F49C> I will shazam and stream on youtube and local platforms. Spotify isn't available in mine. I have a feeling that BTS will break records. Fighting !!!"
"10732","They should’ve gotten Larry David to voice the cameo role in #Shazam"
"10733","Why is shazam set during christmas?? The movie just came out it is April"
"10734","@Ssaaee1237676 @grayghost84 @Partizan_Niksic Snyder never let this red belt exist. No explanation possible. But the scene (in comparaison to the movie, Shazam was fine) destroy everything. Williams.. stunt.."
"10735","Saw #Shazam and it was a pretty good movie, though it was skirting that line for PG 13! I wholly appreciated it though <U+0001F601>The stakes were high and it WENT there. And that ending, was NOT expecting that. So much good stuff here!"
"10736","I am obviously not fit for mature movie content - had a blast watching Shazam last night..."

"10739","@schnapsideer @realmattcooke Yeah, I was responding to your wanting to rate Shazam 4.5 instead of 4. No worries though."
"10740","I really enjoyed Shazam!
Got some feels
It's also really self-aware and even roasted other DC heroes which makes it more hilarious <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F923>"
"10741","So how many lawyers should we have standing by if they use the name “Captain Marvel” in the Shazam movie?"

"10743","Going to go see Shazam today. Hopefully DC won’t mess this up."
"10744","@Cue_Aluta @RonPipes Lol it's alright okes, not spectacular. Like the first 2 Thor movies. Shazam is better though"

"10747","@TunjiAndrews Aqua man I’m not too eager to see tbh... i will give Shazam a try, I’m hearing good things."
"10748","@shugazee story-wise, script writing: step up shazam. practical fx, vfx, cgi and fight choreo: step up aquaman. combine those and maybe you’ll get flashpoint paradox."
"10749","they're really out here outright spoiling shazam and talking shit about it for no other reason except bc it's a different tone and they did the same thing with aquaman....omg do you ever shut up!"
"10750","Watching shazam in didsbury cineworld where 3 options to watch are cost on top of your unlimited card which is not fair I hope after the refurbishment of our local Ashton cineworld we're not going to have to pay extra for most films @cineworld"
"10751","@damiangoal30 @ponysmasher I have seats thankfully. 3 hours until Shazam and I'm pretty excited"
"10752","#SHAZAM did better then #CaptainMarvel... how surprising... how completely unexpected *sarcasm*"
"10753","Snyder Cut obsessers are really posting shazam spoilers to get people not to watch it"
"10754","#Shazam is the coolest superhero movie ever"
"10755","FYI I will be referring to Shazam! as Shazbot! until someone finds it funny so do the honourable thing and like this tweet."
"10756","@UpToTASK Also I love ..love that people Insist that the character was called that until very recently.  Last I checked the name of the tv show in the 70s was the Shazam/Isis Hour"
"10757","Everyone who is just now discovering @ZacharyLevi  in Shazam should know that he is also a Tony-nominated Broadway actor with a gorgeous singing voice-his performance in She Loves Me stands out as one of the best I've seen-both subtle and broadly funny, emotional and romantic."
"10758","@Aric_Almirola @StewartHaasRcng @ShazamMovie @SmithfieldBrand @FordPerformance Haven't seen a movie in years but I'm gonna go check this out, because this is awesome."
"10759","@GitzHQ Saw Shazam an average movie I would give it a 6.2 rating"
"10760","So #Shazam character reminds me of @BeingSalmanKhan 
Powerful, naughty and child like innocence.
#bollywood
#hollywood 
#DC finally has got two good movies back to back #Aquaman 
#Marvel what's next in your kitty after #AvengersEndgame? Better be nice."
"10761","I thought you were talking about the app and I got slightly confused there"
"10762","Most of the reviews are saying it's better than Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Justice League, Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman &amp; Man of Steel"
"10763","I liked #Shazam, but it isn’t nearly as kid-friendly as the trailers would lead you to believe. If you have a kid under 12, take them at your own risk. There’s some scary and needlessly violent scenes as well as some needless profanity."
"10764","@ThisIsMyMJ It's bold to make any predictions at all, (<U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>) but the Shazam bit is wildly optimistic. Many factors need to be in play for Godzilla to be a hit, even so I think 450m is kinda small. X-Men... think it's audience has moved on. Avengers depends on the 2nd week drop off."
"10765","Love how DC is rebooting themselves after that awful Justice League...Shazam is a sure shot winner.. <U+0001F51D>"
"10766","@MohitJa02881263 @itssan17 I agree with your sentiment here but I disagree that @itssan17 is acting like an MCUtard. It’s the “fans” who are gassed by the 90+ RT score that are acting like MCUtards. And tbh, I don’t want Shazam to be too successful because I don’t want @wbpictures to feel vindicated"
"10767","@ShirrakoGaming I’m glad you put Man of Steel up there.  I can’t wait to see Shazam!"
"10768","Anyone want to take any wagers on how hard @ThatKevinSmith cried when Shazam hands that kid the stuffed tiger in the final action sequence?"
"10769","Yes now

Imagine paying 3k for a 10 year old that screams Shazam every 15 mins... Abeg abeg"
"10770","Shazam is not worth cinema money

I'll wait for it to enter xender"
"10771","Shazam! It has heart, it has humour and it is a ton of FUN. Better than anything Marvel has made since the first GotG. Can't wait for more Mr Mind in the sequel!"
"10772","Go and see Shazam then talk to me about it or blocked."
"10773","@ShazamMovie Really funny and enjoyable movie, worth the time, we laugh and got scared and like everything, best DC movie so far! #shazam"
"10774","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Great movie, really funny movie, just a couple of scary moments, I would recommend watching with the family #SHAZAM"
"10775","@TheMilesLuna Miles go watch Shazam! It has amazing representation, a fun and energetic cast, great humor, and a strong message about family! Please! I know you’d like it!"
"10776","A departure from the grim and grounded, and embracing childlike awe and wonder. — watching Shazam! Movie"
"10777","This is factually wrong DC didn't even use Cap Marvel in movie they used Shazam who is a completely different character.

To say Shazam is the Cap Marvel is like saying Superboy Prime is the Superman.

Shazam only has surface level similarity with Cap like both being named Billy."
"10778","Absolutely shocked to learn Shazam isn’t a movie about a black genie"
"10779","I can’t be alone in being completely shocked that “Shazam” isn’t a movie about a genie. Or a remake of “Big.”"
"10780","SHAZAM has a very narrow needle to thread. Billy has to be enough of a jackass that his arc towards heroism has merit, but not so obnoxious that you hate spending time with the kid. Notably, Geoff Johns' New 52 version failed at this *spectacularly*."
"10781","But SHAZAM, even as it's working through beat-for-beat retread of this story, makes it work, often with little changes or just through performance. The infamous scenes of newly-powered Billy buying beer and robbing an ATM play as dumb, harmless mischief..."
"10782","#Shazam was very good and #Aquaman was very good <U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914> DC why did you rush #batmanvsuperman and #Justiceleague"
"10783","Ok I def need to hurry up and see this movie!"
"10784","@AustinRoy007 @ShazamMovie Not judgement. Just different opinions about the movie"
"10785","One thing that Shazam has taught us is that John Glover really loves been the father to bald kids #smallville"
"10786","Shazam. What? Yes, it did exist. How could it have not? Where is the explanation??"
"10787","I’m happy with both Captain Marvel &amp; Shazam, and they’re both in theatres at the same time. I love the 21st Century"
"10788","Shazam was a lot of fun &amp; is full of love. I don’t want to say too much that’d spoil y’all. Warner Brothers and DC need to prioritize building around this movie instead of their heavy hitters. I think they can see that... I hope they do"
"10789","Shazam was a 6-6.5/10 for me. The humour in the film wasn’t for me, and it relied mostly on the humour <U+0001F480> I also REALLY disliked the first half but it picked up. A significant step down from Wonder Woman and Aquaman."
"10790","this the type of shit 15 yo @JennWagner17 would be listening to in her buckle jeans and ed hardy shirt"
"10791","My kids are I really enjoyed #SHAZAM movie. Serious and sad but there are laughs too @ZacharyLevi @DC__Outsider"
"10792","Ok so @ZacharyLevi was totally hilarious <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F64F>#SHAZAM"
"10793","@carlos_Vansoto @wolf9walker @ShazamMovie Well yeah, but even a child can grasp some wisdom. What I'm talking about is the maturity of Shazam. Sure you can be wise for many things at any age, depending on the subject, but that doesn't change the maturity."
"10794","@bossruffalo Yeah but Shazam and recent superhero films were actually good, btw. And we do watch films outside the superhero genre."

So much fun.

"10832","@alylalylalu_ DC is not dark at all tbh.They have a very wide varieties of characters, for instance new gods, green lantern, marvel family.Yan misconception sa dc, just bcos dark ang films ng dc dark n rin characters nyan.Look at Shazam not dark at all, kung ano yung film ganun din sa comics"
"10833","@mmpadellan Thanks. I'm about to see you #Shazam today. I have a free ticket that I should have used to see it on Thursday night when I saw #PetSemetary instead. 

Me: 5.5
Girlfriend: 6

no post credit scenes, and you could easily wait for cable or absolute boredom to see this movie"

"10842","The movie Shazam is dope af"
"10843","Would never, ever have expected to see Power of Shazam film as a kid reading comics growing up. Times have changed and all that."
"10844","Shazam wasn't nearly as kid friendly as I expected (or it should have been) but was still good fun. Last fifteen mins are great superhero fair, and the last moments are superb. Couldn't help but smile to myself when his powers are explained, because it's just so mental."

"10851","So...#Shazam<U+26A1><U+FE0F>....
Wow.
While there were hilarious moments, i didn't expect the movie to be...this...emotional?"
"10852","Fair review. My 7-year-old enjoyed the movie more than I did. I liked it. I just wanted to be sold more on the relationships between Billy and the other kids. Those felt thin to me."
"10853","Just watched #SHAZAM and OMG its SOOOOOO awesome!! The humour was amazing and the cast is perfect *^*
I so cant wait for more of this~"
"10854","#shazam was fun. But I thought Billy Batson the kid has a totally different personality from his superhero alter ego. I find that a huge distraction. Otherwise, great movie. Freddy kills it. 3/5<U+2B50><U+FE0F>"

"10857","For this comeback we need to focus on spotify, itunes &amp; shazam more than youtube, since they weight more for BB charts. Youtube record is good but, it won't help @BTS_twt chart higher on BB200 &amp; Hot100 as much as other streaming platforms'll. Let's work hard! #5DaysToMapOfTheSoul"

one of those good feel movies , where you dont even care about the negative and just full on enjoy the movie . @ZacharyLevi    was really fun to watch , the rest of the cast was also pretty good <U+0001F970> 
especially @gracecfulton <U+0001F60D>

"10859","shazam. first 3/4 of it so boring. just another second line superhero like captain marvel whose movie was overhyped and underdelivered. verdict 6/10"
"10860","@ZachAttackAllen Nice. Is the Shazam 1-4 just called Shazam or would I need to ask for the specific writer to find the correct one? (I have no idea how many different series are out right now). And I might have to check out the other ones you mention."
"10861","@ZachAttackAllen I’m trying to get in to a few different comics. So this is #3 of a new Shazam comic series? Is it good?"
"10862","Aside from Wonder Woman, I gave up the DCEU a while back, but listening to the SHAZAM! score, I think this is one I have to check out. It actually sounds fun."
"10863","I keep meaning to thread things and then forget. I saw Shazam. It had a weak opening and a weak villain, but was overall fun and good. Go see it if you want something fun."
"10864","*random* Ok I know I should be talking about the boys &amp; the concert right now but I just watched #shazam and IT WAS AWESOME!! I loved it!! DC DID GOOD!! I'M PROUD <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D> ok that is all..."
"10865","I saw it yesterday and Shazam is a good, fun movie. This is one I will absolutely endorse.

Struggles, character arcs, actual emotions and humor that works. It's a DC success story."

"10870","@ElGreco218 I liked Captain Marvel more, but Shazam is also great! Such a fun time. Captain Marvel gave a more compelling character arc for me. Both are great though! What an awesome time to be a superhero fan <U+0001F603>"
"10871","That Superman cameo in Shazam made it better. Like a lot. Imagine if Henry Cavill would've made that cameo. <U+0001F60C>"
"10872","Nice to see #Shazam follow all other DC movies by having a 3rd act filled with CGI fighting at night."
"10873","@PrincessHinghoi Wait, I understood that girl said Shazam and transformed into guy. It is perfectly fine and understandable. But guy in 4th picture looks different. Did he turn into a girl? Am I missing something? Or am I looking for something which is not here?"
"10874","Shazam is boring. I wonder if DC operates a money laundering backend to bring in such movies."
"10875","I’m glad I got to see #Shazam a few weeks back before all the goddamn moaning and groaning. It was a fun movie, and was supposed to be lighthearted. It’s a bunch of kids at the center of the story, after all. Besides, we’re getting Joker in 6 months. Tone differences are fine."
"10876","@Expanseshill Shazam left Freddy hanging that one time at lunch, and everyone laughed. This time, Shazam shows up, but also brings Superman. He just did it to make up for last time. Superman means a lot to Freddy. C’mon man. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"

"10890","Ok so guys, just to make it less creepy and more to my comfort zone. If you wanna talk about or request NSFW of Shazam, please refer to him as ""Zachary Levi Shazam"" or ""Adult Shazam."" Refrain from using Billy because as a comics fan I adore this seet kid. But yes Levi is hot!"

"10895","Really loved #Shazam. There is nothing in this movie that will bore you. Don't miss this. A really, really good movie from DC."
"10896","isnt shazam that thing that was at the centre of a mandela phenomenon thingy?? like it didnt actually exist?"
"10897","#Shazam! has crafted its own DNA, and the best part about this live-action version is that it's not formulaic like some of the other DC films that we've seen."
"10898","The first superhero film that can’t top Chinese box office for even a single day since 2012.#shazamflop"
"10899","Shazam was alright cant lie lol. I thought it was going to be really corny but nah it was good for me it was wayyy better then deadpool. Dead pool was just NOT funny they tried TOO hard. But the ending was dope too, with superman making a cameo! And unfortunately dc and WB are"
"10900","Having beef about who will continue wearing the red cape so they couldn’t show his face but that was alright still made the whole theater react lol. And also the little worm <U+0001F41B> made it in too and if u dont know he is the leader of a bad gang of villains lol <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FD> #SHAZAM"
"10901","@Vicquelly That's has to be MCU fanboys. Shazam has been getting some rave reviews."
"10902","With Wonder Woman, Aquaman and now Shazam, the DC movies are looking all the way up."
"10903","Shazam is like the 90's kids movie version of a modern superhero tale and it kinda rules. So many strong Angels in the Outfield vibes."
"10904","I love Zachary Levi, but Shazam just wasn’t a good movie. I really only enjoyed the last 15 minutes. I felt as if the movie couldn’t decide whether it wanted to be serious or lighthearted and it flip-flopped in style so much. I was honestly bored half way through."
"10905","@MellyMaestro I saw it, but only once, the power of Brie elevated it. The Avengers has too many characters I'd never heard of and bloated beyond all reason. I infuriate a couple of people at work by insisting Black Panther and especially Spiderverse were way better. Might add Shazam for bantz."
"10906","Not gonna lie, I'm pretty fucking annoyed that the latino superhero in Shazam isn't played by an actual latino."
"10907","Only the purest heart can resist temptations #shazam"
"10908","Shazam was cute, Zachary Levi is sooooooooooo tall though. He is FINE"
"10909","all the men saying shazam was ""so good it gave them chills,"" that it ""was by far the superior captain marvel"" .................... say you hate women and go lmao i am So Tired"
"10910","shazam! was good fun and a really cute story but, my personal feelings aside, it was not even a technically better film that captain marvel"
"10911","These nights really hating on Shazam and I’m flabbergasted. “The comedy felt forced” ..... what?"
"10912","They need to keep this energy all the way. I like this new trajectory they are going for, it works. I have hopes for Joker &amp; Birds of Prey now."
"10913","Guys, is Shazam in Greenbelt in 4D? If no, where to watch in 4D?"
"10914","i dont wanna spoil anything but Shazam has a good plot twist @ the end tho some of u might expected it or whatever but overall it was very entertaining!!!!"

"10917","@big_business_ Did you see it biz?  I was never into Shazam but it did a good job. Still think DC should go after the bag doing animation like into the Spider-Verse, DC kills it in animation."

"10923","My condensed point is a superhero movie can be serious and good without being overly grim like #BatmanVSuperman or as saccharine as #Shazam. There’s a very beautiful middle ground, namely the #MCU."
"10924","I didn’t like Shazam. It wasn’t awful though. It was cute, but I don’t go to any movie for cute. I was really surprised so many critics liked it. I understand the aversion to superhero movies that are too self-serious but there’s a middle ground between that and Shazam."
"10925","DC should just forget that Man of Steel, BVSCDOJ, Suicide Squad 1 and Justice League exist. Between Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam, they could be well on their way to building toward a team-up movie the proper way."
"10926","Managed to find a window in the dissertation madness to get Shazam reviewed tomorrow."
"10927","@CineBroughton not impressed that the lights came on during the end credit scene of Shazam, 11:40 showing. Could just about see what was happening. #Annoyed."
"10928","I can't believe I paid money to watch Shazam!"
"10929","Final climactic battle with the Shazam Family is so fucking amazing.
The film has some seriously cool and terrifying moments.
I'm glad Mark Strong got a second shot at being a DC villain, because this time he's seriously outdone himself. Sivana is a bad motherf*cker."
"10930","@XanderMobusVO Going tonight! I've been waiting for Shazam to get a film for years! Apparently its really good too"
"10931","one problem with Shazam is how wildly different the adult and kid version of billy are. also where’d he fuckn learn to Fortnite dance"
"10932","@GodAllMighty12 @FilmCriticMaybe Duh, not all bathos is bad.  I find I enjoy most examples of it I encounter.  In Shazam though specific moments that were already REALLY powerful could’ve landed that much harder if they weren’t punctuated by jokes that frankly felt out of placeS"

"10935","Shazam was amazing. Such a fun and enjoyable film to watch would highly recommend you watch it if you like superhero / action film.  Going to give it a high 8.5/10"
"10936","@ZacharyLevi you should be at the NASCAR race today... or at least fly over it with your superhero powers"
"10937","Shazam, a lighthearted family adventure.
Joker, a gritty character drama.

2 different types of a cbm that will be released in the same year by WB/DC
Meanwhile, Disney is releasing 3 identical CGI shitfests, as usual.

But yeah Captain Meh-Vel is so revolutionary, for sure."

"10940","someone please watch with me :(("
"10941","@TomasAli14 @itssan17 @wbpictures I agree but the movie was good. Genuinely. The humor wasn't cheap or cringy at all. MCU humor relies on one liners. Shazam didn't have cringy one liners . It had genuine ""moments"" with lots of build-up which were funny. 
The only thing I can complain about is disrespect for Henry"
"10942","@KyleJamesHoward I don't watch superhero movies but watched Shazam because I love anything Zachary Levi. My teens loved it and I really liked the story line. I'm not an expert on the genre but I enjoyed it."

"10945","That awkward moment where you're still in the habit of calling DC's #SHAZAM by his old name of ""Captain Marvel"", and he happens to have a movie out at about the same time as Marvel's #CaptainMarvel so you book tickets to the wrong movie by mistake."

"10963","Shazam was so good omf I hope it really gets the recognition it deserves"
"10964","Shazam was AWESOME!!! Best movie in the DCEU as far as I’m concerned. DC is truly turning it around and going in the right direction for it’s movies. And it doesn’t push a political agenda, but rather it teaches you how important family is. Truly great superheroes movie #SHAZAM"
"10965","Love to show up at 9:30 am to see Shazam because I am apparently incapable of sleep"
"10966","I want to tell you a funny story: yesterday I didn't have time to finish my lunch before going in to watch Shazam, so I hid my fries and lemonade inside my purse and ate it while watching the movie. Had to hide it all because food from outside the movie theater is not allowed. xD"
"10967","Breakfast and then SHAZAM! today! :D"
"10968","Gotta be honest Shazam kinda sucked. It cute moments but changed it from comics and I’d 25 people are present opening weekend on Saturday night it’s a box office bust."
"10969","retweeting @OriginalFunko to win #Shazam"
"10970","@ScientistMel @ShazamMovie @tomhanks Sad to say. I remember the tv show from Saturday mornings. I might look at it when it hits Netflix."
"10971","Shazam! (Read Captain Marvel, seriously they really need to get the ability to call him that back) is fun, not great, but fun and also sad."
"10972","So apparently the secret to a good #DCUNIVERSE movie is not being directed by Zack Synder ***1/2 stars to #SHAZAM"
"10973","@TheDCUniverse i hope shazam can produce the second one."
"10974","Batman, Harley Quinn, and The Joker would all be stomps for Captain Marvel....he's always found a way to prevail over Supes, and I think he'd find a way to do the same against Wondy....GL would be interesting, but edge Shazam"
"10975","Just watched #Shazam, with my son, at the cinema. <U+0001F60A> Really really enjoyable, even for someone like me who isn't really into superhero movies. 8/10 from me. 10/10 from my son. <U+0001F44C>"
"10976","Captain Big Red Cheese was definitely a lot of fun (surprisingly dark, and a great use of Mark Strong and Zachary Levi) #Shazam"
"10977","#Shazam is the first film in a long time to genuinely capture that Goonies / Indiana Jones feel of mystical adventure awe while also nailing the dark tone DC was aiming for all along. Felt like The Last Crusade for. It’s also a lovely feel-good movie.

Also Pet Semetary is solid."

"10993","@computerkind91 @ShaBatPrince i wasn't going to see it sine i never really cared about captain marvel.shazam but considering wb recent plans like new ss film called reboot and the batman called soft reboot dc fans who want snyder cut of jl should not be giving wb money."

"10995","@IDS616 I still have to see Suicide Squad, Aquaman, Shazam, and Man of Steel."
"10996","Shazam is fun to watch, and I really like it. Its not serious or dark theme, its about a ancient magician give his power to a teenager, and how responsible he will use his power. A teenager that have problem with his new family and at rebellious stage."

"11002","@RottenTomatoes There are 7 movies in the DCEU right now. 4 have had mixed or negative reviews (MoS, BvS, SS, JL) &amp; 3 have had from just positive reviews to critical and public acclaim (WW, Aquaman and now Shazam!). All I'm saying is DCEU has been on a good course lately &amp; it's getting better."

"11005","Bit unfair showing THE superhero trailer before Shazam

#Endgame"
"11006","#Shazam doesn't disappoint. Super fun. The start of a new hero for sure. @ZacharyLevi is awesome."

"11010","@joycest14 @PaigeCummings32 Understood. My Fave is Thor Ragnarok, but I know Paige and she digs empowered women. I thought Captain Marvel was an easy top 2 in that scenario.  Shazam was great though."
"11011","We’re about to watch #SHAZAM!"
"11012","is anyone else disappointed as fuck about this “superhero” movie Shazam ? shit looks stupid as fuck"
"11013","Isn't it funny how @WBPictures is getting excited about a @ShazamMovie box office total that @Marvel would consider a disaster for one of their major releases."
"11014","Best thing about SHAZAM for me is that it feels like a middle finger to Zack Snider’s vision for superheroes. It was about time."
"11015","@SinemiaSupport I sent a DM but is this a widespread issue that selecting a movie doesn’t work. Big weekend with Shazam! Come on guys!"
"11016","Really good movie"

Me and Robert will be back for the 1st 4 episodes and the last 4 episodes of #legendsoftomorrow so 412 and 416"
"11020","Went to see Shazam!, with nephew, Tom.

Loved it! It reminded me a lot of 80s films like Raiders, Goonies, and Ghostbusters with a bit of Harry Potter mixed with superheroes."
"11021","This guy has got it going ON! He is so spot on!
Just go see @ShazamMovie already, OK?!"
"11022","@ColliderVideo @ShazamMovie @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial Stand by Me is excellent. @Jgrazerofficial and @AsherAngel should be in the remake #StandByMe"

"11026","Acting and the chemistry btw actors, the family theme and that Christmas spirit were great.
@ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi and the all @ShazamMovie cast and crew thank you for this amazing movie. You are AWESOME. <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"11027","I love #Shazam. Storytelling was so good. It was better tham what I expected especially tje second half. They woke up the little child in me who want to be a superhero. I left the theatre with a smile on my face."
"11028","Man I throughly loved Shazam. It reminded me a lot of spiderman homecoming."
"11029","Actually really wanna watch Shazam again, proper movie that"
"11030","Yesss it happened to me when i was watching Shazam last night, me and my housemates were like 'wtf are we in the wrong hall or sumn'"
"11031","Yess it happened to me when I was watching Shazam last night, me and my housemates were like 'wtf are we in the wrong hall or sumn'"

"11033","Here’s what I want from the next 2 #Shazam films: (Spoilers)
.
.
.
.
-Shazam and the Monster Society of Evil: Billy and family fight the combined threats of Sivana and Mr. Mind. 

- Shazam v Black Adam: Sivana and Mr. Mind find Black Adam and release him upon the Shazam Family."
"11034","Obviously Shazam appears in the first real Justice League film. They only ask Billy to join and Freddy is a little jealous but Billy puts Freddy in charge of taking care of Philadelphia. Freddy asks Billy to find out everyone’s secret identity cause “that would be awesome.”"
"11035","But when Brie Larson was fighting for diversity, yall went nuts. <U+0001F480>"
"11036","I also want to be able to say Shazam and turn into @ZacharyLevi , i mean who wouldn't want that?"
"11037","With #SHAZAM movie.#dc 
Is this the rise of DC movie's?"
"11038","With #SHAZAM movie.#dc 
Is this the rise of DC universe?"
"11039","everyone make sure to support shazam currently in your local theatres now"
"11040","Couldn't get to watch shazam and endgame is coming it's way :/ Now I couldn't decide what to watch"
"11041","Please review every movie ever. 

K, thanks"
"11042","#Shazam was both fun and heart-warming. It's a superhero movie that has a good blend of humor and adventure which for me made it a success.

"11043","im gonna miss saying shazam in theatres 5 april so much i loved my job"
"11044","Shazam is officially my favourite DC movie <U+0001F919><U+0001F4AF>"
"11045","#Shazam was effortlessly great (a breath of fresh air)! Entertaining start to finish. Unlike #CaptainMarvel ugh i think people just “needed” to love that film because it’s from Marvel, but no it sucked."
"11046","@jencloo @ShazamMovie Boy and I liked it a lot, too."
"11047","@TaishoKenneth Shazam hasn't even come to my country. How is it flopping when it hasn't even been released to some countries?"
"11048","Second watch was bit more intriguing. The one liners are a treat to the ears. Zachary levi never, even for a moment made to think that he was out of character. Emotions, humor, plot was all well placed. This laughs and makes you cry at the same moment."
"11049","How often is that a movie makes you feel more inclusive more compelling on the 2nd watch. For me after FAN, Zero, &amp; BvS, Shazam topples it up to the list."
"11050","Ooh, and I bet the guys at @IVSoftware are really chuffed that one of the characters in Shazam namedrops Uplink!"
"11051","If Shazam is going to have Black Adam at some point, I hope he gets played by a really attractive Egyptian fellow."
"11052","Shazam was amazing. I said years before that I wanted a Shazam movie, and this was everything I wanted and more!"
"11053","My local theater misspelled Shazam on the marquee as Shamaz and I've been thinking about that all weekend"
"11054","Highly recommend y’all to watch Shazam"
"11055","during the scene in Shazam! where the regular door opened into a wow! magical dimension, Wax leaned over to my chair and whispered in my ear ""WELCOME TO THE HIMALAYAS"""
"11056","This basically articulates how I felt after seeing #Shazam with a 7,8,10 year old kids. Two of which covered their eyes for a large chunk of the movie, and laughed for the rest."
"11057","Hell yeah these little mf aint so little anymore already tall &amp; lanky as shit in press interviews"
"11058","Saw Shazam last night. Great job @DCComics! You're learning how to do a comic book movie. The dialogue was great and so was the story! But please stop trying to sell us on Justice League. Not happening..."
"11059","@AsherAngel @ZacharyLevi i’m going to watch shazam tomorrow and i couldn’t be more excited!! i know i’m going to love it"
"11060","I predict people will mak sans #Memes after seeing #SHAZAM"
"11061","Watched #Shazam. Mixed feelings. Liked the lightness of it, bit different than prev DCEU. Villain good, humour ok, a few haha moments that made me smile but not that many HAHA moments. A little tryhard? They're 15 but they act like 12? Loved the family theme though. 7.5/10"
"11062","end of shazam out of context : oh worm"
"11063","From a marketing perspective, it doesn't really make a lot of sense that they didn't include Black Adam in Shazam, with the rock being a big star and all"
"11064","April may be the best movie month in years.  #Shazam @HellboyMovie and #AvengersEndgame back to back.  Wooooooooooo!!! #MovieGeek"
"11065","@greentauros John Wick 3 is actually about John Wick sewing Shazam instead of Captain Marvel and all the feminists hunting him down"
"11066","@deephashtag @ReallyIsaac @Avengers I’ll never take it back, cause Shazam was the most fun I’ve had in the theater in years. See it ASAP."
"11067","It’s definitely worth seeing. It’s different from any other DCEU film. I compare it mostly to Spider-Man: Homecoming honestly. The Disney Channel original movie comparison is actually pretty accurate but it adds some darkness to balance it out and it helps more than hinders"
"11068","@drmoore @ShazamMovie Just curious how you handled the strip club stuff and language with the younger kids. Movie looks great but I can't decide if my 10 year old son is ready for it."
"11069","Loved #SHAZAM that was the most fun I had at a comic book movie since I was a kid @AsherAngel @ZacharyLevi and the rest of the cast and crew are all fantastic and did an amazing job."
"11070","It's on the DC app...really hard to watch now <U+0001F602><U+0001F913><U+0001F648>"
"11071","Aquaman and Wonder Woman were good too."
"11072","Shazam. Avengers. Game of thrones. Cobra kai. I can’t even contain myself this month.

Nerd. Gazam."
"11073","@Zakiyyah6 It actually had a solid hold last weekend, but the incoming of both Shazam and Pet Semetary hurt it this weekend. Hopefully it can stabilize a bit before Endgame comes around."
"11074","Shazam is forcibly gonna get dark when he gets in the justice league"
"11075","@Vermouth1991 @Planet__G @Only_Grey The Shazamily was awesome. It truly saved the movie for me and I'm glad I wasn't spoiled. Shazam might not be a great movie, but I loved what it was and what I needed to be. It had heart. a TON of heart."
"11076","I’m about to find that context!"
"11077","@tumza_45 I'm seeing 'Shazam' already on torrents, or is it the camcorder quality? <U+0001F440>"
"11078","Had seen many people say #Shazam was reminiscent of Donner's Superman. I think that might be people who didn't like MoS having nothing else to compare it to, because Superman 78 is nothing like Shazam. Probably the same people that see any meta humor and think it's aping Deadpool"
"11079","oh i forgot to say Shazam is an instant all time fav. definitely loads of christopher reeves superman vibes and it all just works"
"11080","Remind me of someone ..."
"11081","I will watch you this week. If I have a fucking TIME."
"11082","#RandomThoughts Watching Shazam this afternoon. I hope it's as great as the buzz."
"11083","Yall ang ganda ng Shazam and the ending &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 yall ang smart ng ending, I DID NOT EXPECT THAT hahaha"
"11084","I loved Shazam. DC finally remembered what superheroes mean to kids, and it was great fun as a result. They’d lost a lot of that in the quest to recreate the feel of Batman Begins et al."
"11085","When to see the Shazam! movie yesterday, went with my mates but got separated because most of the seats were taken. Apart from that it was great."
"11086","@BleedingFool I am going to have to go with a tie. Superman and Shazam. Because of the sheer wonder these two movies inspire in the two generations of kids that have been exposed to them. I know it’s just the 1st weekend for Shazam, but the Superman effect is already becoming obvious."
"11087","Hey @RossButler  I saw you in #ShazamMovie  <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> And that's the best part of the movie <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F4AF>"

"11090","@TAGintheGame Shazam wouldn't hurt it but Pet Sematary did. All the same one 53% drop and a 58% this weekend is not good. The film is already a hit clearly but there is a shakey word of mouth issue."
"11091","Should I go see Us again tonight or try Shazam again? Hoping theaters are empty since others will be watching WrestleMania and I can have a chill night in the movies"
"11092","Writing about the top 5 “obscure” DC characters that deserve a film now that SHAZAM! was a success! Yes, plastic man is number one."

"11100","@derrickmordente I just watched it too.

Shazam has been one of my favourites for a while but that really did it. Top marks."
"11101","#SHAZAM is a pretty good movie.
It feels severely more earnest than any of the mid-level Marvel movies(I'm looking at you Ant-Man &amp; Dr. Strange) and naturally darker than anything DC has barfed out Post Dark Knight because of well established, down to earth stakes."
"11102","Ah, Shazam! So worth it! So much fun from start to finish. I walked into the screening complaining about the price of admission but I walked smiling. :)"
"11103","@DiscussingFilm Im going to the theatres to watch shazam now lol"
"11104","How that I’m few hours removed from watching Shazam, what I really liked about it is how much it reminded me of big/ jingle all the way meets gremlins  sprinkled with goonies. Really a send up of hopeful and slightly twisted 80s family film."
"11105","‘Us’ did more than a DC super hero movie opening weekend. <U+0001F62F>"

"11107","Thats cute"

"11119","@thespiffspazam @jayjay3x @YPballin fr especially bc #shazam in theaters now. it's great go see it"
"11120","@Harlack did they all get exact same level Shazam powers? Could he have shared god-like powers with as many people who could hold the staff? Since the point at the start of the film is trying to avoid power corrupting doesn't it follow that at least some of the foster kids go bad? 4/?"
"11121","@Harlack Why are they tied to the crystal/eye? Why does Shazam care about finding a replacement if just leaving the crystal there in it's case will do the job as it does at the end of the film? Why are we shown they have a really effective method of fighting Shazam by turning to smoke 2/?"
"11122","@Harlack The problem with your Ant-mens and Strange Doctrates is that they felt somewhat generic in spite of being weird interesting concepts.

The problem with Shazam is that nothing really makes sense. What do the 7 sins want? Why? Why do they want Mark Strong to have Shazam powers? 1/?"
"11123","@Harlack why include the mom subplot if he's going to have zero emotional reaction to it's resolution? Why is he a goofy jokey weirdo when he's Shazam but dour n sensible as a kid? 

Ant-man/Dr Strange are generic but at least they don't raise lots of these kind of questions. 5/5 I guess."

"11142","@ponysmasher In the New 52 comic, the Shazam family had limited powers. When Shazam shared them, everyone was slightly weaker, including him. Is that how it works in the film? Or is everyone just as powerful?"
"11143","@ScottMendelson Do you think Shazam’s opening is good enough for Warner Brothers to start at least considering a sequel? Or is it too low for them, and probably won’t?"

"11326","@pcanella That being said, I really enjoyed Shazam! last night. Great writing, good performances. Smaller scale of film compared to CGI onslaught of Aquaman (which I also liked). I really did LOL a bunch of times. But I care more about Shazam character than Aquaman b/c of the story."
"11327","Y’all so my father the audio man in church and this man just pulled out his phone to Shazam a song <U+0001F480>"
"11328","Wait I just realized the meaning of the tiger in Shazam. TALKY TAWNY.
Thank you, Mr. Sandberg"
"11329","SHAZAM TWO OF US !!!!!! #TwoOfUsStreamingSession"

"11336","Shazam needs to break 400M. After that, Joker has a shot of at least 800M simply because it’s a well known character. If the movie is really good then it might legged to 1B dollars."
"11337","@SHAAN87989064 @MichaelF788 @BORReport @wbpictures @newlinecinema @ShazamMovie Antman had a budget of 130-160M while Shazam! had a budget of 85-100M. Know the difference"
"11338","Just watched #Shazam<U+26A1>. It was hilarious and emotional at the same time, the story was beautifully crafted with some funny dialogues. The cast was great, Actions were good,Dr. Shivana was menacing. Also best part of the movie was family. 
Spent a good time at cinema after along."

"11340","@double_oh_Pop Same here. Totally agree with everything you said minus the Captain Marvel, which I did enjoyed but nowhere near as Shazam or Aquaman but it's all about personal preferences. I haven't seen Ant-Man and the Wasp. I'm not really into Marvel or the MCU. I'm very much a DC guy but -"
"11341","@double_oh_Pop While I wouldn't say Shazam! was the best DC film made since the Nolan trilogy, I'll say it's the one that surprized me the most. In a good way. I haven't enjoyed half of the recent DC films but Shazam is one I'll definitely buy on 4KUHD and watch many ~many~ times in the future."
"11342","@Capt_Ck I knowwwww!
Then I dragged hubbi to a movie shaam ko #SHAZAM and really didn’t care for it hahahaha it’s almost funny!"
"11343","This is why we carry knives"
"11344","Did these guys promote Shazam well?"
"11345","4 movies weekend #Lucifer #Shazam #SuperDeluxe #Dumbo"
"11346","I watched Shazam! And i really enjoyed it. Honestly, I think Wonder Woman is still the best DCEU movie but this film is still great. The characters are lovable, the themes are surprisingly mature and Levi is just soooo good."
"11347","Things I liked about Shazam! 2
Easily the funnest Superhero movie climax I’ve seen in awhile. Something heartwarming about children discovering they can be super heroes. @ShazamMovie"
"11348","Things I didn’t like about Shazam!
The opening set a weird tone. it doesn’t match the rest of the film at all. Could have opened with the fair scene and the film would have work just as well if not better."
"11349","Things I liked about Shazam!
The casting is spot on. Everyone did a kick ass job with their roles. Honestly the best cast of kid actors I’ve seen since Harry Potter. @ShazamMovie"
"11350","Things I liked about Shazam! 3
The more I think about it the more I really admire the representation of the foster family in @ShazamMovie Too often foster families are seen as a negative thing in film, seeing a happy loving foster home is something I’d like to see more of."
"11351","Finally got a chance to see SHAZAM and I must say a huge congratulations to @ZacharyLevi for his portrayal of the titular superhero he successfully embodies comedy and seriousness in every scene he was in to make every moment enjoyable here’s to many more to come"
"11352","If you guys haven't seen Shazam yet, you should. It's really good. Probably one of the top 5 superhero movies to come out since 2008"
"11353","Seeing Shazam today. I’m excited because I have a pretty good track record with really enjoying superhero movies where I have no knowledge of the character going in (I.e doctor strange, ant-man)."
"11354","@wrestling_1000 @ERCboxoffice my bet is shazam will stay first place"
"11355","This weekend was nice, watched Shazam at the movies, played great Apex games, 7 days to die as well as DBD off stream with close friends. Sometimes you just got to relax and take it easy, did me good. Have a fab Sunday all and please go check out the following people ----"
"11356","please watch this movie..."
"11357","@markliterally @ShazamMovie <U+0001F62E> And here I’ve been telling folks it’s super kid-friendly. <U+0001F62C>"

"11360","I changed my name and went underground when it became public that I’m a Zack Snyder fan. 

I haven’t seen my family for 6 years now."
"11361","@Bass_Ige Them dey drink for mall? I dey chill small I suppose come see Shazam next this week or next"
"11362","@AKARELK Just curious cause I haven’t seen the movie yet but why Captain Marvel 3rd and Shazam 4th??"
"11363","Got Aquaman to rewatch, now that I've seen Shazam! Both movies have a fair chunk in common. A not long thread. Minor spoilers."
"11364","@ZacharyLevi Such a fun movie with a great message! We really enjoyed it! <U+0001F604> and it’s super fun to shout #Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"11365","oh ya forgot to say this but shazam is so wholesome and good it deserves all the praise it’s been getting. even if u aren’t a fan of superhero movies it’s so lovely and fun and very fun to see in theaters :)"
"11366","If I use the #shazam app while listening to the soundtrack of the movie #Shazam while watching #shazam. Does my phone evolve to a tablet? #showerthoughts"
"11367","Shazam! #ShazamMovie was the best DC movie. I'll let you argue for WW and I haven't seen Aquamamoa,  but I suspect I ain't missing anything. Good mix of fun, excitement, fear, winning. All balanced. Really good movie."
"11368","@imdbjourney @KevinRBrackett @InSessionFilm @MGnPpodcast @SuperMoviePod @NextBestPicture @DareDanielPod @WeWatchedAThing @cinema_recall @CinematicallyC @thecinemantics #SHAZAM Big + Superman + Gremlins. It's like finding lightning in a bottle in the DCU. It has so much heart and soul. It’s hilarious. Great cast &amp; direction! Surprisingly dark scary moments. Everything you would want in a fun family superhero movie from the late 80s or early 90s."
"11369","Came into #Shazam to fan girl over @ZacharyLevi ...

Then @RossButler and @Handlebrody show up and my heart is just bursting <U+0001F618><U+0001F60D><U+0001F609><U+0001F60A><U+2764>"
"11370","Came into Shazam expecting to fan girl over @ZacharyLevi ...

Then @Handlebrody and @RossButler  show up and I'm just too happy for words <U+0001F642><U+0001F60D><U+0001F618>"
"11371","So I'm pretty sure people will agree with me on this, but #Shazam is definitely a Christmas movie. I mean if we're following 'Die Hard' rules then it most definitely qualifies"
"11372","@markusbethzai @MaamSyj Ironic you mentioned Pride because I just watched Shazam, and the villain can summon a demonic manifestation of 7 deadly sins, hence Pride and Money I would assume (or in this case) is Greed."
"11373","The 2nd most powerful line of the film..

#1 is what Billy told his mother"
"11374","Shazam was just ok to me. I don’t really like his character and his family of incredibles"
"11375","@ZacharyLevi I saw @ShazamMovie . And it was beautiful! I love the fact that you are part of DC Heroes! And I'm enchanted with the kids cast of this movie! Pure magic!"
"11376","@GiteshPandya Obviously captain marvel had a bigger sat drop, it opened to triple the amount of Shazam. Weak comparison"
"11377","@AmazonChique Jesus Christ people learn box office first. Shazam is being celebrated because the budget and marketing cost is far FAR less than what was Ghostbusters."
"11378","@J_Friendly @JohnnySobczak @AmazonChique Marketing cost for Shazam is around 45-50m, that is the rumored budget. A box office receipt of 400m plus is huge profit territory. If Ghostbusters would've had a more contained budget it would've profit."
"11379","Wait, what? Cloak and Dagger season 2 is out? That's awkward. In the same month as OnePunchMan S2, Game of Thrones S8, Shazam, Hellboy, Avengers Engame and Cobra Kai. Really? Well I'm not seeing it."
"11380","@ZacharyLevi Just wanted to say thank you! My kids are all grown up (19 &amp; 20), yet they still arranged their busy college and work schedules to go see Shazam with their mom. We had an awesome time, the movie is fantastic!"
"11381","I am becoming less popular each day on Tweeter. I am down to nine followers. That's fine with me because I am not that exciting. Did I tell you that I saw ""Shazam"" and it was very good. Later to my big nine followers."
"11382","did shazam really have to wake us up this morning geez"
"11383","How is everyone’s Sunday going?

A new week is almost upon is but why not shrug off the Sunday blues and enter our latest #giveaway!"
"11384","This is super annoying"
"11385","@Bazzionaire @JordanPeele Go see shazam and tell me if i should see it"
"11386","I should tell you guys I had to go to 3 movie theatres last night for the #ShazamMovie 

The last two had most of the seats taken! #Shazam is pretty popular!"
"11387","The main thing I want to know about Shazam is if an Endgame trailer is playing in front of it?"
"11388","I enjoyed every second of the @ShazamMovie 
The original captain marvel is better than the current one! <U+0001F64C>
#ShazamMovie #shazam"
"11389","@Zakiyyah6 No chance this was beating Shazam. It's a hard R rated horror flick that can rub a lot of people the wrong way. Against a light-hearted superhero flick, its no contest."
"11390","I lived in Philly for 5 years. The most unrealistic thing in #Shazam was how clean that subway car was."
"11391","I can’t believe I saw Pet Sematary in theaters before Shazam..<U+0001F97A>I’m really gonna have to wait for so long to see it"
"11392","Everyone I’m watching Shazam right now and I hope everyone has a good day"
"11393","@ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel fantastic movie and was really funny, definitely one of my favorites <U+0001F602><U+0001F60E><U+0001F918><U+0001F3FE> #Shazam"
"11394","@MatPatGT what did you think of Shazam and where is the film theory on it?"
"11395","@MattMitovich Saw both in last two weeks. Way more interested in seeing Shazam again than CM."
"11396","@ScottMendelson @Forbes In terms critical acclaim, audience satisfaction and boxoffice, #Shazam seems to be playing out more like Into #The Spiderverse than other Comic Book Movies. And that is perfectly fine. Both these films actually have a lot more in common too the more I think about it."
"11397","the fact that they put “feat. Halsey” bc they knew we would’ve figured it out with shazam like we did with IDOL and Nicki Minaj <U+0001F602>"
"11398","Hopefully there's no original version of the title track since we have a hard time doing Shazam's during IDOL because we had to Shazam the Nicki version rather than the original @BTS_twt"
"11399","Friendly PSA: I won't link to it because it contains massive spoilers, but Rafael Casal had a great little thread about SHAZAM yesterday that speaks to one of the more off-putting aspects that I'm not sure anyone involved fully thought through and I haven't seen brought up before"
"11400","@nussey12 In Sarnia they took Glass out of theatres after 16 days so I still haven't seen it. I was thinking of going to see Shazam tonight. Is it worth it?"
"11401","#Shazam is really a great movie. It has the standalone feel and fun of Aquaman, but with much stronger heart, story, and writing. The performances are great, and this movie proves DC knows what they’re doing. They’re definitely catching up to Marvel"
"11402","---&gt; it has got to be the worst superhero movie ever made #shazam"
"11403","I love @FaitheHerman in #ThisIsUs. I loved her more in #Shazam! Congrats! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"11404","Just took my lads to the cinema to watch Shazam and although it cost me a fortune it was a great film no good for my siatica though and I had an ice cream so fuck it the floodgates are open now cheat Sunday has now commenced <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"11405","Thinking about going to see Shazam tonight. Anyone interested."
"11406","I hope this doesn’t mean hitting the wall."
"11407","I love Zachary Levi. He's very open about his experiences regarding mental illness and does not hesitate to give his followers advice on how to better their lives. He always brings a positive energy to my timeline. We really couldn't have had a kinder man to lead Shazam."
"11408","Still can’t get over how much I enjoyed #Shazam! It’s truly a blast and a half! Extremely pumped to see that it’s doing well this weekend. Big congrats to @ponysmasher, @ZacharyLevi, and the entire cast and crew!"
"11409","Watching #Shazam with the family <U+0001F917><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"11410","remember to shazam while you stream"
"11411","@SuicideSquadcst @DCSquadcast @Allenfire @ScottDC27 @brentacPrime @TheFliteCast @revrim @jordanfunky If I was shazam I'd read the review out loud. Chances are thay say shazam a bunch of times in the review"
"11412","Shazam so boring sia, not worth af"
"11413","Saw #Shazam last night... I liked it. Darla is the cutest little girl ever I just wanted to hug her! I loved Zack Levi in the role! Not enough action. Pretty funny tho. My theatre went crazy at the end when Superman appeared. So wish Henry Cavill and WB could work things out"
"11414","@nicsother1 @AngryJoeShow I feel like beginnning with Shazam, they ditched the need to copy Marvel and make every movie connected."
"11415","@ShazamMovie <U+0001F37F>#SHAZAM <U+26A1><U+FE0F> is the best superhero movie if seen in over 10 years!! Loved it <U+0001F37F>"
"11416","OK so I saw Shazam! Honestly best superhero movie of 2019 (perhaps of 2018 too) DC are SERIOUSLY knocking it out of the park when it comes to well written, quality movies. Definitely gonna go see it again. #Shazam"
"11417","@AgniBankai Best was the Shazam and Freddy dynamic.

When Zachary comes onto the screen, you just want him to be there through out"
"11418","Good though

#Shazam

Gotta love Zachary Levi."

"11422","About to watch this #Shazam movie..."
"11423","@ErikJLarsen @1JohnLivesay @ShazamMovie @JerryOrdway @ZacharyLevi @DCComics @geoffjohns @sterlinggates @aaronlopresti I'm unfathomably jealous."
"11424","@I_Am_MFR @realChaseSmith @Die_Wil_Wheaton @RevengeOTFans Henry has been liking Instagram posts from Zac Levi that are promoting Shazam! You think there's anything to read into there, besides support from one superhero to another? I have no idea what his feelings on the Shazam! ""situation,"" and the film itself, would be at this point."
"11425","@WaltDeWalt Omg that looks so cool <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> also, enjoy Shazam! I saw it last night!"
"11426","Shazam is weird to me maybe because I don’t know the comics but why is a little boy turning into a grown man that’s a lil strange especially seeing people sexualize the older version of him like it’s not the same little boy"

"11435","I didn't really like the Shazam movie. It didn't suck. It was ok I guess. Just didn't like it. But my son enjoyed it so im happy"
"11436","@leftoblique @AmazonChique DCs captain marvel/Shazam is such a trash character. I have totally contempt whenever they bring his ass into a bat girl story."
"11437","@Trav_Adair @k4nish @ShazamMovie @annabellemovie @ponysmasher Haha, nice. I've seen it twice and didn't catch that."
"11438","Finally got to watch Shazam! I can say this is the best DCEU movie by far. It's consistent, the one thing all past DCEU movies lack. It has a compelling story and focuses on actual character development. This movie has a lot of heart in it and is not just another set up movie."
"11439","Shazam is the real Captain Marvel movie people should be watching and looking up to. Not the overhyped wannabe feminist icon and sorry excuse of a hero in the MCU."
"11440","I woke up early cause I'm going to see shazam soon &amp; bts finally posted the teaser hsjdgdhh"
"11441","@grayghost84 I absolutely love BvS and loved Shazam. BvS is and probably always be the best CBM ever. But I don't see what's wrong with liking Shazam. Not every film has to be jokefest. Not every film has to be a serious Drama. Seeing the Joker trailer and then seeing Shazam ensures variety."
"11442","@MrsMinka Shazam!  Is really good.  Pet Cematary I hear is better than the original seeing that one tomorrow."
"11443","I hopefully seeing Shazam tomorrow"
"11444","I like both Captain Marvel and Shazam equally but for different reasons.  There are things that Captain Marvel has that Shazam lacked, and there are things that Shazam has that Captain Marvel lacked.  Both are good movies.  Not the best, not the worst."
"11445","@JBadaman @uneducatedpop @wintergotham It’s straight if I had to actually think about it I’d put MOS world engine 1 Miles what’s up danger 2 Shazam roof 3 no mans land 4 then 5 is probably up for grabs"

"11447","Love that the casting director for Shazam was apparently really into Josh Schwartz shows"
"11448","Most people’s idealized version of themselves isn’t being fat. Superheroes aren’t fat because they move and do things. Movies are fantasies and most of us want to see beautiful and attractive people playing these roles. It’s not some indie film, it’s a DC franchise film. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"11449","@mrsundaymovies Just been to see Shazam with my 7yr old daughter. Who at the end credit scene, out geeked me by explaining what is was about."
"11450","#Shazam is fun. I'm glad [spoiler] happened in this movie too, instead of later.

Also, I'm amused that Dr. Sivana's father was played by the same guy who played Lionel Luthor."
"11451","@Sharito742 @J_Friendly @AmazonChique Exactly. For better or worse, Sony was all in on GHOSTBUSTERS financially, probably because of the name recognition the franchise has. WB played it safer with SHAZAM!, as a mostly unknown character."

Please, DC. More of this. I love it."

Something tells me tracking is very flawed..."

"11486","@Harlack Shazam was predictable at every turn, and I didn't like the main character. Srsly, he commits about as many number of crimes as the villain (not as severe tho). To me it was a lost cliched 90's movie with subpar special effects and wonky script. A few out of place dark moments 2."
"11487","Watched #Shazam with my girl, 8/10 a very fun experience"
"11488","no one will go see shazam with me :,( i just want to see zachary levi i love him"
"11489","Shazam is actually a super fun movie, don’t go in with any expectations for a unique story or good CGI and it’s well worth seeing"
"11490","Glad Shazam has so much heart in it. If they’d ruined Billy Batson, I would’ve been done."
"11491","I forgot all about this."
"11492","@LeCinephiles Can we replace Zach in Shazam with Patrick warburton"
"11493","Can people please stop posting scenes of Shazam :) no spoilers pls :)"
"11494","Am I the only one who saw it in the first time?

Maybe it's just me. I like hunting easter eggs. Especially when it comes to a film about my favorite character."
"11495","The movie Shazam was about family. Shouldn't have watched it"
"11496","One more thing about Shazam, spoiler free.

The guy behind us had a loud-ass cartoon laugh and he was enjoying himself. I can guarantee you he would recommend the movie."
"11497","I think this might be an unpopular opinion, but did anybody enjoy #Aquaman more than #Shazam? Zachary Levi is perfection in his lead role, but I felt like the end of the movie didn’t quite stick the landing. Aquaman was a fun (cheesy) blast from start to finish. #DCFilms"
"11498","I definitely need to see Shazam again before other movies takes over theaters."
"11499","@TeenSuccubus Her comic runs... especially the civil war stuff was HORRID. People hated her character. I still have yet to see the movie I will in a few minutes. Shazam was movie of the year"
"11500","@ShazamMovie Movie of the year"
"11501","Shazam! is fun-filled teen superhero movie. It's bit Deadpool-ish. As they say, it's certainly light-hearted DC that we haven't seen before. I loved Zachary Levi's boy-trapped-in-superhero-body performance."
"11502","2 movies in and this guy has convinced himself D.C. is already better than Marvel. This is a great example of why you can't listen to DC Fanboys. MCU is 20 movies over 10 years. Come back with your bullshit in a decade if Disney hasn't bought DC."
"11503","did anyone else whisper yell “seth cohen” when adam brody popped up in shazam"
"11504","I absolutely loved this movie and @ZacharyLevi is just <U+0001F970>!"

"11508","I'm probably the only individual that liked Shazam but is not praising it as the best DC/CBM movie and I'm fine with it <U+263A><U+FE0F>

It's far from the best CBM and definitely not the best DC movie for me but y'all can have at it"
"11509","Just watched #Shazam half an hour ago and I've never felt the urge to share my opinion, but I had to! THIS MOVIE IS THE REASON WHY I LOVE SUPER-HERO MOVIES!!! It's so good and touching and exciting and funny and emotional and more! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!"

"11518","@mrsundaymovies Shazam was yet another entertaining movie from DC even though I could’ve used more action, but do you think Shazam will get his own version of the suicide squad in a solo film since they introduced Mister Mind?"
"11519","#Shazam 3.5/5.Thoroughly enjoyed the refreshing hilarious super -hero fantasy ride. Unlike some super hero films which are dark &amp; bleak, this one is a riot. #ZacharyLevi is a scream! #DC has a winner as the movie has an engaging script mixed with fun elements &amp; emotional connect."
"11520","#Shazam

Highly entertaining<U+0001F60D><U+0001F4A5><U+0001F929>

Great that @DCComics could pull of a film beyond their usual cliches..

Liked his prev one, Anabele Creation and this as well

"11527","Is it creepy to stand outside someone’s door in my building and Shazam a song? Because I just did that and now am questioning my own judgment"
"11528","@JohnnySobczak @AmazonChique I don't think those numbers include the marketing budget.  The wiki has quotes from director and company saying they would need to take in $300 million to break even.  Anecdotally, I haven't seen nearly as much build-up for Shazam as I did GB2016."
"11529","I've been feeling like crap most of the past week, so I'm finally starting to feel a lot better now, thankfully!

Hopefully I can get back to work tomorrow, as I've been getting a bit stir crazy the past few days, but I did go to see #SHAZAM today and it was great!"

"11531","#Shazam was really good! Very funny, heartfelt story that is completely goofy and stupid, but it works because the tone is consistent. Zachary Levi had great charisma and did a good job carrying the film. 7.5/10"
"11532","@_Fruhmann_ It was nice that the old Shazam had no choice but to put his trust in Billy even though he had sworn to find someone perfect, he had to let go of his old trauma and open his heart and Billy had to do the same. He doesn't know them that well now but is now open to trusting others."
"11533","12) Shazam 

I really loved this film, it was tongue in cheek, didn’t pretend to be anything it wasn’t. It was silly &amp; just a fun movie. Also, Zachary Levi <U+0001F60F>"

"11535","@ikeonmovies @movieballer_64 But Shazam! wasn’t empty, soulless, and BLAND."
"11536","Shazam was so good. If this was the first movie in that world, that would be amazing. They nailed it. The tone, the heart, this was definitely a must see."
"11537","Everyone needs to see this movie! This character is really hard to bring to the big screen but they did!!! @ZacharyLevi was amazing and so believable as a 15 year old in an adult body. This was AMAZING!!  Think Tom Hank BIG mixed with superheros!! DC finally has joined the party!"
"11538","At supermarket, waiting for random kids to lock eye with me and then shouting Shazam! . It’s fun <U+0001F602>"
"11539","I spent a lot of my time on my blog this weekend. I still wanna review on Shazam but I'm so tired lol"
"11540","Shazam was great fun. There was a line of serious dialogue that got a genuine emotional reaction from the audience, which I don't think I've ever seen from a superhero movie."
"11541","Shazam! Was a good movie!! My Captain Marvel's did a good job!!! I'm proud!!! Looking forward to more from both of them!"

"11544","Was it? Ok I'll try to see it in two weeks. Shazam isn't a priority. Kinda lost faith in wb/DC..and interest. I rode hard for them and the studios legit HATES planning and having good ideas."

"11548","@DailyNightwing Great casting, and none of it felt forced!

I’m not big into Shazam comics but I believe that matches what they are in the comics too, no one changed the characters to please a certain ethnicity group. Could be wrong, but that was nice to see."
"11549","@bradmiska Well, to be fair, Shazam! saved some money by going to Party World for Djimon Hounsou's wig."
"11550","@ponysmasher  nailed shazam!
@ZacharyLevi  is made for this role.
Film with perfect blend of various cinematic flavours.
Wonderful job from the young cast and Mark Strong nailed it as Sivanna"
"11551","#SHAZAM! was everything I wanted in a super hero movie. My kids loved it!"
"11552","Okay Shazam! was the dumbest and most Geoff Johns thing possible but was also exactly awesome at what it was supposed to be. 

Also props on going full Captain Marvel with  the sequel set up, hiding the third act so well and also something else I won't spoil!"
"11553","It's not the ant-man of the dceu by a long shot.  Halfway through and this movie is hilarious."
"11554","@ShazamMovie That's not a compliment it's backhanded"
"11555","Watched it. And really liked it. ~surprisingly~"
"11556","#Ghostbusters 144 million budget to 229 million profit and needed 300 million to break even.

#Shazam 80-100 million budget to a break even point of 230-250 million and looking at a minimum of 350 million Worldwide."
"11557","@J_Friendly @JohnnySobczak @AmazonChique The break-even point for Shazam is 230 to 250 million.

Ghostbusters needed at least 300 to break even and it didn't even come close."
"11558","@SonicPhase I saw shazam and I thought it was really good, this is not sonic related but lately you have been giving your opinion on different kinds of media in your tweets and I wanted to share how DC is finally going in a good direction with their movies. That is all."

"11560","@EricDJuly thoughts on Shazam?"
"11561","@Harlack I though Shazam was ironically similar to the other Captain Marvel film: not a particularly likable protagonist, tonally all over the place, unmemorable action, overall ok"
"11562","#SHAZAM was such a entertaining movie. All smiles and laughs. More surprised how well they pulled off certain characters from the comics. Hell, might go for a second viewing."
"11563","After watching Shazam, I fancy watching Big, but it doesn't appear to be available on demand anywhere. Tsk."
"11564","@theStarWarsHQ this is for you Ryan, Robby and for everyone that follows you...  GO SEE SHAZAM! , it was an amazing movie, I loved it."

"11583","It deserves more than that. Very good movie"
"11584","@Harlack I agree, except the last act just did the whole ""Hero stands up to villain, villain takes hostage, hero has to sacrifice himself to save them"" twice which was... Well it kinda degraded an otherwise great and funny movie. Shazam is a good movie... But I hate the last act."

"11592","Probably poop like the rest of DC live movies"
"11593","Probably one of my biggest issues with Shazam! was that while Freddie had tons of hero merch and shirts, and talked about them a lot, I don't recall seeing any sign of anything for Cyborg - and I think that was a real missed opportunity."
"11594","Idk, and like, I'm coming at this as someone who isn't disabled. But it just seems like a meaningful thing to include. (And also because Cyborg and Shazam were often around each other in the nu52 based JL movies?)"

Him: ""oh right, Chuck.""
Me, at exact same time: ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: the Squeakquel."""
"11611","@AndyWarth @zhengyingli It’s the focus on other people. Shazam was ultimately about power being worthless unless you shared it with people. Billy only saved the day when he embraced his family.

Clark only saved the day when he embraced his individualism and values.

"11618","@Only_Grey I agree. Shazam was not being Heroic for most of the film ( Which they do address). Seeing some folks fall all over this film just exposes their hypocrisy. I really liked Shazam btw. But I don't wanna see every DC hero with the same tone of this film."
"11619","@Planet__G @Only_Grey C'mon on man. I get what ur saying, but u can't possibly believe that Snyder's films are the only ones with tension and weight. Shazam had its moments. During the board room scene. When Billy was dropped. When he damaged that Bus. Even WW n Aquaman had tension in them."

"11657","#Shazam = bang average. It felt like a PG watered down version of #Deadpool"
"11658","@MarsNeedsTacos @ZacharyLevi Totally 100% LOVED Shazam!! As did my fella and 8yo boy. Excellent, family fun"
"11659","I truly enjoyed this movie"
"11660","off to see shazam in my pajams <U+0001F918><U+0001F61D>"
"11661","@GeoffGershon @SHAAN87989064 @GiteshPandya And that was 4 years ago. Factor in inflation and the numbers would swell to at least 70M...

Deadpool had a $55M and it opened 3 times bigger than Shazam. Now that's called success..."
"11662","yo i can’t believe Shazam is gonna be in Avengers End Game"
"11663","@Xbox I like Lightning on the Xbox one x and the controller have the data of movie SHAZAM!!!!!!!"
"11664","shazam is ameyzing! would highly recommend y’all to watch it"
"11665","@cineworld Loved it! Would love it even more if the full films are shown over the 3 screens <U+0001F60A> Shazam! Was very good - a great asset to the DC series! <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FB><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"11666","Shazam did $50 million this weekend? Pretty much what i predicted"
"11667","Shazam... potentially DC’s first good movie since the Nolan’s Batman trilogy? #shazam #hadouken"
"11668","Well #Shazam was everything I expected and more! Don’t think I’ve enjoyed an origin story as much as I did with this film. A rare occasion where a film completely lives up to the hype and delivers"
"11669","We really enjoyed Shazam!

I give it a week at most before the timeline is full of fanart of his dad lol"
"11670","Saw Shazam with a group of 12 people ranging in age from 11 to 74, and everyone loved it. Super fun."
"11671","It’s pretty cool, rite. []"
"11672","I wish you could Shazam people in LA"
"11673","Shazam is one of the best DC movie  so far. All the love"
"11674","@AsherAngel @ShazamMovie It was amazing so proud of you Ash"
"11675","Going to see #SHAZAM later today!"
"11676","Shazam really piqued my interest in Black Adam so do you guys have any Black Adam reading recs?"
"11677","I already can't wait for Shazam to be released on Blu-Ray so I can hopefully get a blooper reel and enjoy the movie whenever I want <U+0001F629>"
"11678","Back from watching #Shazam and really enjoyed it. Went in with little knowledge and no expectations as such, and it just worked for me. I’m liking what DC is doing with their recent films."
"11679","Idk what bothers me more about this post... the fact that people in the comic book community are this shitty to each other over who we like more, the fact that some chick did the opposite of what captain Marvel would do, or the fact someone was out there looking to do this?! #wtf"
"11680","It was honestly pretty decent <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"11681","#SHAZAM was so entertaining! @ZacharyLevi acted exactly as you would expect a 15 yr old would who suddenly has powers and it was great.  And I loved seeing Adam Brody in the film!"
"11682","@SirRaiderLeague please i think khazix and zed 1 shot u before support can do any shazam"
"11683","@amandadeibert Watch the Cubs game and then go see Shazam."
"11684","This is a stretch but I would absolutely die if we got like 4 Shazam movies in like three years<U+0001F602> I can only dream"
"11685","@InfinityPods @screenrant Well if they continue making movies like Aquaman and Shazam DC movies will never be good again."
"11686","@eli_anci @screenrant Well since BvS is best comic book ever made yes it's better than some crap movie that looks like 2 hours long CW movie with headless Superman. SS is more entertaining than Shazam."
"11687","Number 2 is one of the reasons why I love it so much. No love story subplot which means more time for action and main story <U+26A1>"
"11688","Y’all I went to see Shazam at 9:30 in the morning on a Sunday and nobody else is here. I’ve peaked. I’m never going to have a better idea than this ever again"
"11689","I'm so excited! @ZacharyLevi I'm going to watch Shazam tonight! Squeee!"
"11690","@benntacles damn :/ u should just like materialize in my house and then we could go see shazam together <U+0001F60C><U+0001F60C>"
"11691","I just watched Shazam and still dying of laughter at the scene where Freddy is washing the dishes"
"11692","A lot of people who I would not expect to like Shazam are liking it, so I’m a little pumped to see it now. I’m still not confident that I’ll like it, but I’m way more optimistic."
"11693","Soaring high fly #dumbomovie, then saying the name <U+26A1><U+FE0F> #SHAZAM <U+0001F4A8>@cineworld what line up for tonight #CineworldUnlimited @ShazamMovie @Disney_UK"
"11694","@ShazamMovie Welp, I won't watch it because of this gif"
"11695","I really enjoyed Shazam, so I guess we are 2 for 2 on Captain Marvels this year."
"11696","@lexluthox @Josh2Gud4U I'm just speaking some facts. WB fucked this universe and fans are upset about it. Shazam is good, but they still fucked the universe (IMO)"
"11697","Finally! DC has made a great comic book movie again and that is #Shazam! So, so good. A feel good comic book movie full of heart, which Marvel lacks. Do yourself a favour and see it @ZacharyLevi #ShazamMovie"

"11703","@hopevdyne @ashlakazamm I watched it back-to-back with Captain Marvel and everyone started laughing at some parts and everybody clapped because of how good Shazam was, including me! Also CM was amazing but Shazam made me happy."
"11704","Went to go see #Shazam today! It was very whole some and good. I recommend watching it.<U+26A1>"
"11705","@Lostboy2580 I think Aquaman has better action scenes and wa shot better in general but Shazam had a better cast and was genuinely more “fun”"
"11706","They should also really stop releasing POPS before movies even release. Once i seen the first act of Shazam i knew how it’d probably end just off the toys lol"

"11723","I didn't know #JimmyFallon played #Shazam in the movie. Seriously, like, every time Shazam acted childish annoying awkward creepy &amp; bumbling fool I thought it was some bad sketch of the Jimmy Fallon Show, even talked with the same voice and had the same stupid facial expressions."
"11724","Billy from shazam is officially my spirit animal. He's sad and doesnt feel belong but still be funny and cackling jokes <U+0001F923><U+2764><U+FE0F>"

Zachary Levi is perfect as Shazam in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as Iron Man and Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool."
"11726","the visual aesthetics of the movie were a delight to the eye. and that dc only serves good suits realness but i have to point it out: the details of shazam's suit were perfect."
"11727","As great as technological advancements have become over the years, few things have amazed me as much as Shazam <U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FD>"

"11736","#SHAZAM is just a really fun time. It manages to balance comedy with emotional moments really well. 7/10 for my end conclusion."
"11737","@ZacharyLevi  If Wonder Woman was ever in question, Aquaman on the right track then Shazam is undeniably good. The best that DC has up to date 9 out of 10!  
#shazam"
"11738","It's better than the tracking predicted remember the 40 million . This film can reach around 700 to 800 million but even justice league 650 would be a big result . It's an outstanding opening"
"11739","Well that's higher than Batman news said but then they do and find a negative hook. This is a fantastic opening"
"11740","Final result! #ShazamMovie wins! What did you think of it? <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"11741","Shazam was very fun and wholesome.

"11749","#Shazam is a really nice movie."
"11750","@MrOlayinkaa This life is beautiful  #Shazam"
"11751","Given the debate over if it's kid friendly I'd be curious to see @Mackey_Fam to a review of #Shazam where the younger kids do more of the talking so other parents can better decide if they should take younger kids."
"11752","@RealJoshHowe I'm gonna see it because Shazam is a cool character."
"11753","One doesn’t have to be a fan of comics history to appreciate the awesomeness of the final scene in @ShazamMovie before the main end credits, but if one does know their comics history, that sequence is nothing short of absolute mind-blowing."
"11754","@thepamilerin What happened to Monday #Shazam"
"11755","@thepamilerin What happened to Monday #shazam"
"11756","@CineGeek18 I completely agree. What Deadpool did was blow the roof off what a superhero CAN be, knocking the walls out, the door down. That allowed Shazam to breathe. It's also why Captain failed to me. They didn't take those risks, give her flaws or a theme. No subtext, no meta"
"11757","We’re spontaneously seeing Shazam later <U+0001F60F><U+0001F60F><U+0001F60F>"
"11758","liking comics is so hard there’s always something going on that is gross to see anyway:
Shazam was a fantastic movie and I wanna see it 800 more times"
"11759","#Shazam starts off kind of slow and a bit cringe with the villain backstory, but Shazam and his foster family carry the movie. Were great in every scene. A few emotional moments in otherwise a comedy film

Absolutely deserves the 90% critic and audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes"
"11760","@thepamilerin Shazam the movies #Shazam"
"11761","Shazam is the DCEU's best film to date. No excuses, caveats or anything. Great from start to finish."

"11763","The amount of times I used my shazam last night made myself a whole new playlist"

"11767","@thepamilerin What happen to monday #Shazam"
"11768","@SAOQFan4Life 1) I will go see Shazam. 2) you have to watch a little bit of Marvel movies, c’mon girl they are Fun! Also there’s Chris and another Chris those two should be your main reason to watch<U+0001F609> then RDJ who’s wonderful to watch his acting. then the gorgeous Scarlet Johansson. Just start"

"11772","Don't normally push brands... but this trailer got me waaaaay more excited for Big G than anything else so far. Never post it online."
"11773","#DC DOES NOT need a new „tone“ for their movies. #Shazam was lighthearted and funny, because SHAZAM IS LIGHTHEARTED AND FUNNY. Are people really THAT stupid that they dont understand that different characters have different tones in their comics/ movies? #DCEU"
"11774","Theory for sequel: the girl Shazam gave the tiger plush to wishes for the plush to be real and either through latent psychic ability or some external force, the tiger actually comes to life how she sees him."
"11775","I've watched #Shazam. And I can say,  little shot. I was surprised from the beginning. I could not eat my popcorn with emotion. Making such  a movie would be my dream. 
I hope it makes a lot of success, because this movie deserves.@ponysmasher and @ZacharyLevi thank you for that."
"11776","#Shazam was awesome and hilarious, I recommend Shazam. There’s a guy that says Shazam and becomes a bigger guy, it’s pretty epic <U+26A1><U+FE0F> @ZacharyLevi did a wonderful performance <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC>"
"11777","@thepamilerin Fuji house of commotion #Shazam"
"11778","@SwimGolas @AMERICArlin You are part of the problem. You say this as if a studios past defines their future. Shazam was 47x better than captain marvel. DC could easily become a real competitor for the mcu if they continue to pump out solid films. Another example is Sony animation making spider verse."
"11779","You’re right, Shazam is no competition at all <U+0001F618>"
"11780","After watching the trailer to #SHAZAM, I marathoned Chuck since I never saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now after watching Shazam, I think @ZacharyLevi has to be one of the most likable people &amp; if you don't like him you hate America. Also it's really good, go see it."
"11781","i almost fell asleep watching shazam. sad. that just solidified that im really not a dc movie person."
"11782","""Shazam"" is so good. <U+0001F49A>

I dont really appreciate my movie theater throwing at my face the fact there will be so many good movies this year though... ""La llorona"", ""Hellboy"", ""Avengers: Endgame""... aaaaaaah."
"11783","@JoshMom96 @amazonmusic @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie The soundtrack is amazing. Ben did a great job."
"11784","@DinosaurDracula OMG yes!!!!  This, beating Oregon Trail while recording it (hence, documented proof), and seeing Shazam = #WeekendMade <U+0001F60A>"
"11785","Shazam was good. 
Fun, energitic, full of heart. 
Actors were great
Gives me the og superman vibes. 
Would watch again."

"11787","Just back from seeing #shazam and really really enjoyed it. Great family film."
"11788","So I'm definitely watching Shazam tomorrow."
"11789","Just saw Shazam and man jack grazer and zack Levi were good"
"11790","Shazam = Guardians of the Galaxy"
"11791","@thepamilerin #shazam
Nimbe is the movie I'm recommending at this point in time"
"11792","@TweetsByKaushal @ZacharyLevi @Jgrazerofficial Yes, starting with Wonder Woman and now Shazam!"
"11793","@thepamilerin #SHAZAM  I hope I win today"
"11794","SHAZAM! has a lot of heart and a great young cast! A really fun film! The foster family scenes were definitelythe highlights for me #Shazam"
"11795","I really hope I can see Shazam tonight. Can’t wait."
"11796","Apparently something I predicted would be in Shazam a while back actually happened. Seeing it tonight but proud of myself for calling it."
"11797","Just realised this year might have the most amount of Superhero films I've ever been looking forward to. Avengers 4, Shazam and Joker (yes I guess that isn't technically a Superhero film but you know whatever)"
"11798","Just saw #SHAZAM and yes definetly the best DC superhero movie so far!"
"11799","@yedammadey im 100% sure its junkyu's song shdhshs i've shazam it and even asked siri but that song is nowhere to find"
"11800","I feel like the wizard from Shazam waiting for a new champion to outperform Heath Ledger. I'm genuinely tired. I am so sick and tired. I actually block both of my ears whenever I hear any Joker dialogue from TDK. I can't. It's an endless loop of nostalgia. Please stop."
"11801","The truest, most authentic moment of #SHAZAM is when Billy gets into  a #TTC subway station without paying and the escalator is out of service."
"11802","So I'm getting very good reviews and ratings for Shazam. The mean rating so far is 8.5 and that's huge! Some people are even giving it a 10. Toh. I never intended to put it on my watch list, because the trailer just be as e get. But, I'd add it. I shouldn't be too disappointed."
"11803","Heading back home from watching Shazam it was a pretty decent might be a few minutes late for #BorderlandsGOTY with the boys but I will see your faces in about 30ish mins"
"11804","any mutuals who saw Shazam this weekend that wanna be in a video talking about it with me as a flimsy excuse for me to get more content out while I figure out what I'm doing for my actual videos?
it'll be fuuuuuunnn."
"11805","Lol Americans sure spend a ton of money"

"11809","You know you’re having a great time watching a movie when you keep looking at the people you’re with to just silently laugh and share scenes together #SHAZAM"
"11810","I went to watch Shazam last night and I fell asleep. But from what I saw, it was a good movie. Little cheesy but good"
"11811","@ashleymcnamara I am surprised Shazam has been that poorly promoted in the Pacific NW. <U+0001F923>"
"11812","we went and saw Shazam last night &amp; it was AWESOME. 10/10.. DC outdid themselves with this one."
"11813","i just hope all the bitches who came at the shazam cast &amp; director saying they were making captain marvel jokes to promote their “shitty movie” are having a bad day"
"11814","I hate what happened to JL. I wanna see what Snyder shot but life goes on if I don't see it. It is what is. Posting spoilers on the TL knowing ppl wanna see Shazam and posting them in their mentions is selfish. You have no common courtesy."

Those will stand their ground for something they love and not go back to corner and support everything with DC logo."
"11819","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie You should talk more about #ReleaseTheSnyderCut and not movies that ruin Superman even more."
"11820","@Serranoj19 @BobDigi69 @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Too bad because every movie since he left is awful."
"11821","@MrTeriffic I posted picture of headless Superman and somehow i ruined Shazam for everyone hahahahaha they had 2 days to see it even more with pre-shows so it's fair + it's my profile. And now they are lying how i go to people mentions and post spoilers hahaha"
"11822","@vinaldo7 Well apparently i go to people mentions and post Shazam spoilers hahahaha . They are people want to see Justice League but they would be ok if they don't see it as long as WB is making more movies. They will be the first people to go and see The Suicide Squad"
"11823","@JEGSimmons2 @wbpictures Nope. It's Williams but they are very similar since Shazam went straight down that awful nostalgia road."
"11824","@newsflxsh @BobDigi69 @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie How is this disrespectful?"
"11825","I wish I could be like Shazam but instead, I grow boobs and ass and lose all body hair when I say “girl”"
"11826","shazam popped off and that’s all i got to say"
"11827","PS 2: Thanks the people on the TL for remind me about this: the legend/rumors said Cavill actually shot the cameo as a alternative version in case the contract been renew. That doesnt mean (if true) we dont see Cavill on that scene someday. #Shazam"
"11828","Bashing Shazam isn’t something Zack Snyder would want, most of y’all don’t even wanna bash the film, you’re just doing it to fit in, and your fakeness is genuinely transparent."
"11829","That is very interesting, because it shows maybe the contract situation wasnt that shaky was we thought, which is aways a good sign. #Shazam"
"11830","#Shazam  the villain is shockingly scary and so are the seven deadly sins.  I did not expect such a scene chewing cold, calculated depiction from Mark Strong,  who  for the most part seemed to love his role onscreen."
"11831","Do property law professors ever teach the history of Fawcett, DC, and Marvel comics' fight over Shazam/Captain Marvel? Would be fun this month."
"11832","Dope movie, me and the kids enjoyed it... #DCEU #DC #Shazam"
"11833","aquaman budget is 160 million hence the amazing underwater CGI. shazam is 90 million with a story focusing more on family."

"11835","What did you think of #SHAZAM??"
"11836","Saw #Shazam today!! Such a great feel good movie!!I want to watch it again! 
 I also know what I want to cosplay as for @MCMComicCon now <U+0001F602>"
"11837","Seeing Shazam in 2 hours! Really looking forward to seeing how good the action is"
"11838","@Josh2Gud4U No one hates JL and what happened to JL more than me. That said, Shazam has so many homages to MoS and BvS that I don't understand why most fans are against it"
"11839","I just watched Shazam and thought it was incredible. But I’m now really upset about Henry and Ben leaving as Supes and Batman because it really feels like the DC universe is getting padded out now and it’s wicked"

"11850","@PNemiroff Loved the video Perri! I was so nervous but I ADORED Shazam. I have to say, one of my favourite scenes (well, more of a moment) was when during the carnival fight, Shazam hands the little girl the tiger toy. It made me well up, because it’s the moment you go: ‘he’s a hero’."

@ZacharyLevi did a good job. It was light and funny. My son LOVED it"

"11889","“More than half of the audience was under the age of 25, including nearly a third under age 17, according to PostTrak. As a way of comparison, 46 percent of those turning out to see Captain Marvel on opening weekend were under 25. Males made up 65 percent of ticket buyers.”"
"11890","comic book shazam fans will love the last half an hour even more"
"11891","@tank4daCubz @TracyPereira20 Glad you enjoyed it. Beyond my expectations. My son and I were laughing non-stop... and some intense scenes as well. #SHAZAM was epic fun."
"11892","#Shazam is a decent comedy-drama but the action is pretty boring by modern superhero movie standards. Small scale shouldn't limit the thrills of an action set piece. We've seen Kingsman(first one) balance comedy and action well before."
"11893","@wolfmanwalter13 Regarding critic reactions I heard they did a secret screening at SXSW and the reactions in there were positive. I think if the reactions are very positive they could lift the embargo 2 weeks before the movie is out, like they did with Aquaman and Shazam."

"11908","Finally saw #SHAZAM 
I really liked it. The cast did a great job and the story was entertaining, and a bit crazy considering some of the threats in it. Overall, a very enjoyable film though it might be too intense for kids at some parts.

"11924","just did more damage by breakin the window than taking the money
and no cops? #Shazam"
"11925","so he chooses billy without a single test; he could be a bigger villain if that other kid failed the test #Shazam"
"11926","they justify the shazam change very well they really thought this out in a realistic way for audiences #Shazam"
"11927","id make a static electricity joke about when he touches the knob but it feels too on the nose #Shazam"
"11928","also super villains are a common thing so you'd think there would be police procedure for someone in a costume, like it would be prevalent that everyone would know he's some powered dude or a nutbag #Shazam"
"11929","ANd that guy is just NOW calling security? wtf? #Shazam"
"11930","like empowering feminism in this modern day shit #Shazam"
"11931","even without his power eye the actor would totally beat the shit out of the actor playing his brother 
DAMN OUT THE FRIGGIN WINDOW!!! YEAH BABY!!
i love this villain!!! #Shazam"
"11932","i like how the cripple foster  brother is like a superhero fanboy in a world where heroes exist, like this would be so common people wouldn't even care about sports #Shazam
and he never used super strength or speed by accident on the way home? #Shazam"
"11933","so the wizard dies and does he give billy all his power rather than just being his avatar? #Shazam"
"11934","and these bullies show up again, once more parking on the curb like a couple of assholes; do they even go to this school?
why is there no police there? i mean lots of cops after all these school shootings should be on premises especially after a public vehicular assault #Shazam"
"11935","1. the dude had nunchucks in his back pocket after riding in the SUV
2. nobody was recording the bullies picking on the cripple
3. no TEACHERS came out after nearly a minute of two older kids picking on a cripple despite billy assaulting them
4. they chase him down? why? #Shazam"
"11936","thundercrack I should use that #Shazam"
"11937","i like how bily is less of a scumbag in this than in new 52 but that school is super close to a subway line, why aren't there police around to prevent pedos from abducting kids if it's that easy to vanish #Shazam"
"11938","is there no security here? #Shazam"
"11939","the foster mom worrying makes sense this is really the idealized thing but makes sense  #Shazam"
"11940","also this is a shitty test i mean the 7 sins have left (again idk why they need a champion/avatar since wizard is only there to guard them) so he has no method to test billy
#Shazam"
"11941","i'm sure video footage of billy as shazam would be online too if he's that garish which would get on the radar of Waller #Shazam"
"11942","""Lay your hand on my staff""
""Gross""
LOL i love it this really is spiderman #Shazam"
"11943","fat kid drawing all this satanic shit is hardcore
also why is bilys journal in the trash #Shazam"
"11944","Ok pause; wizard is expositing the backstory of I suppose black adam releasing the seven deadly sins which infected the world...BUT this is taking place in same cinematic universe as wonder woman and her greek gods. So what is the wizard/sins in relation to the gods #Shazam"
"11945","the red hood on billys hoodie is apropos #Shazam"
"11946","also NOBODY was good after a couple thousand  years? all the people who have done good work, 9/11 responders or anyone who is doing selfless acts of charity #Shazam"
"11947","oh wait his dad lived? and not only survived but is still alive FIFTY YEARS LATER?!
but he's paralyzed? this is bullshit #Shazam"
"11948","what kinda cafeteria is this  anyway its like middl/elementary school eating together? no teachers #Shazam"
"11949","wow thats vehicular assault of a minor are y ou kidding me 
and no teachers?? #Shazam"
"11950","so he's champion of sins? #Shazam"
"11951","they make the costume work kind of like first avenger, it justifies it #Shazam"
"11952","Ok back, and I love how the villain uses science to try and get back to the rock of eternity; magic is just another form of knowledge like science #Shazam"
"11953","they wrote ""dont scream"" in russian on the paper when billy puts the paper on the window #Shazam"
"11954","Some great Easter Eggs, was very surprised/pleased with the ending. I want more Shazam movies and I really want to see him interact with Aquaman and Wonder Woman."
"11955","Oh man, #Shazam is great. Everything I had hoped for, genuinely enjoyable. More like this, DC"
"11956","Just come out of my first viewing of #Shazam @ZacharyLevi is unsurprisingly amazing. Funny and touching. Makes me miss Chuck even more. Can't wait to watch it again.... And fingers crossed a sequel."

"11958","Shazam is the best thing DC has done and they need to stick to this separated universe thing"
"11959","@hybridlion @SamParkerMetal What you deem are Facts aren’t facts. If you say the movie was bad, that’s your opinion. If you say this or that sucks that’s you’re opinion. If you say Shazam is played by Zachary Levi that’s a fact. It’s subjective. What you think sucks could be amazing to someone else."

"11975","You really think tossing out Shazam spoilers is going to get that done? That doesn't even scratch WB in the long run. Why? Because the general audience doesn't know, or care who YOU are and won't see your spoilers. Ever. Because they don't live on Twitter like we do."

If I don't slip into a food coma later, I want to try get some writing done as well.

But I have to get to bed early, because I START MY NEW JOB TOMORROW!"
"12192","@TheNiceCast_ I believe shazam 2 could focus more on other family members like how they got there for first half with all of them exploring 7 realms and sivana and mr mind making the plan to kill them"
"12193","@atembo10 Thankuuuu the girl who recorded it while i was massaging added it’s I’m trying 2 find it <U+0001F629> Shazam it<U+0001F923>"
"12194","Shazam is the best movie ever"
"12195","@RoninEtrian @WhatAWorld18 @Sydney_3G1C @IGN oh c'mon both movies were great but shazam showed how a real life kid will use the superhero power in real life unlike going to save the world which we see all the time."
"12196","@ShazamMovie Loved it waiting to go again. I never normally laugh at most films, but this had me bursting out a few times. Brilliant <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"12197","This is marvel country <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> what the fuck"
"12198","as im going to watch shazam...i feel like its my duty to tell you...shazam bts when the mv drops kiddos"
"12199","I ain’t know it dropped this weekend. Ima check it out Tuesday"
"12200","Shazam was shot with an $80m budget, now it's made $158m worldwide in it's opening weekend, it has virtually doubled it's budget already. This is good business, Warner bros can kickstart sequel talks now."
"12201","Shazam! Movie The best DC Team up movie who knew ???  It was fun had some dark moments a great Bad guy and just a good watch . Top 3 of the Current DC Flicks !!!"
"12202","@WarnerBrosEnt Shazam! is nothing but the best DC movie since Dark Knight. Thanks for the entertaining 2 hours. I had goosebumps, laughed like I’m stupid and had a bunch of onion cutting ninjas around my seat. #SHAZAM! #dcu #ZacharyLevi #MARKSTRONG #dccomics #newlinecinema"
"12203","@HackinTimSeeley Not sure why everything has to be ""fun"". It's OK for movies to do different things. I loved Shazam and Aquaman, but movies shouldn't have to follow their paths. A challenging experience can be just as atisfying to me as a fun one."
"12204","I know Shazam will be great. No doubt in my mind. Such a fun character"
"12205","@SonicPhase ...and is slowly going lighter and more comedic, now shazam finally feels like a step in the right direction where as I'm worried joker might be a step back because they are going dark again. It would be one thing if they are trying to go for DC's multiverse tho."
"12206","so shazam is literally fucking AMAZING."
"12207","Just peeped Shazam

Better than 95% of the MCU"
"12208","darla is the best character in shazam like there's no contest"
"12209","Shazam feels like it's channeling the original Spider-Man trilogy, so whether or not you like it will depend on whether or not you like those movies.

As for me, I think Shazam is one of my favorite movies they've made."
"12210","@sparkIefingers (spoiler) remind me, was one of the 'A's in Shazam Artemis? I assumed that's what Mary represented. I think I assumed right that each kid represented one of the six immortals?"
"12211","@byBuddhaJones @wbpictures @ShazamMovie This photo rules"
"12212","Shazam was good I really liked the end credits LOL all in all pretty good for a DC movie"
"12213","anyway i just love that septa didn’t give dc permission to use their actual logo, trains and buses in #Shazam lmao"
"12214","so shazam was amazing and i want to go see it 200 more times"
"12215","@Stemot1978 @Partizan_Niksic I don’t want every single DC movie to be a ZS a movie. That’s not an endorsement,  Shazam was just great movie and I love it. I don’t ride and suck ZS dick like y’all do"
"12216","To any #Chuck fan on the fence about Seeing #Shazam LIke Chuck, Shazam is great on so many levels. Funny, Exciting, Heroic, Heart Warming and it's about Family. Also @ZacharyLevi is equally outstanding in both! Go see it NOW!"
"12217","Going to see Shazam here pretty soon. Looks like it is suppose to be a Marvel comedic take for DC,really looking foward to it! <U+0001F91F>"
"12218","Where can I get a clear version of Shazam?"
"12219","okay now can Henry escape from the netflix prison for five seconds and say smth about shazam?? dkdndjdnisa i know it took him forever to congratulate jason on aquaman but A GIRL IS STARVING"
"12220","@yulissssaaa_ Sheldon is wearing a flash t shirt and you thought flash and Shazam were the same person"
"12221","Saw #Shazam yesterday...apart from being 30 minutes longer than it should've been, it wasn't *completely* awful. No idea where the high review scores are coming from though....or why they needed to say ""shit"" about 800 times during the movie <U+0001F914>"
"12222","@LukeoftheTauri 2hours of an annoying cripple and little character development of the main character(the kid, not the adult Shazam)"
"12223","@Al_Nickerson Agreed. Just something about it. I get he can't be Captain Marvel because of the lawsuit and all that, but I think it'd have been better to call him Captain Thunder than Shazam--that kinda gives away the magician's magic spell word, don't you think?"
"12224","Captain Marvel and Shazam are both mostly good movies. I'm scared to death of how shitty Dark Phoenix looks."
"12225","@DHforHOF That's pretty much verbatim what I said yesterday. I felt like with Shazam, they're finally starting to understand the formula (what makes a good movie). Writing, directing, &amp; acting are important, but Marvel wins because the characters are relatable. It's the same in the comics."
"12226","I want to scream ""Shazam"", but have lightning hit white supremacists."

"12246","ok dw guys im gonna watch it again today on behalf of everyone"
"12247","@ZBrag101 @NoLANlST @SHAAN87989064 @GiteshPandya Shazam is an instant classic.

Just like Marvel copying DC and vice versa for decades, every comicbook movie borrows ideas from one another.

It all matters on how you execute it.

Shazam executed it flawlessly."
"12248","@Jambeanie Off to get my superhero film fix and see Shazam!"
"12249","Saw Shazam! Wonderfully silly and fun. #Shazam #movies #markstrong #fun"
"12250","Thinking about going to see #CaptainMarvel tonight now that I have a bit of time off of work. I’m looking forward to this film and haven’t heard anything negative about it. I’m willing to bet my favorite part will be when #BrieLarson shouts #SHAZAM &amp; turns into #ZacharyLevi <U+0001F604><U+0001F644>"
"12251",".@ponysmasher seriously loved Shazam. Question, no desire to give @Handlebrody the Speed representation of Shazam's powers as a nod to his Flash casting from JL:M or @DJCotrona flight (nod to his Supes casting) Anyway, happy to see them get their Super Hero due."
"12252","@ShazamMovie since seeing the movie,my 6yr old daughter has been obsessed with giving and receiving suitcase wedgies. @ZacharyLevi"
"12253","On the plus side, running to Carrefour also meant that I got to see #Shazam. It was a fun romp, and surprisingly more emotional than I expected. @meagan_unlcas will cry. Also, why was it not released around Christmas???"
"12254","@Vishwajeet1OB @ShazamMovie The movie showed how a child is vulnerable upon receiving super powers..... It's not a typical make believe superhero flick but seemed very original and practical..... No offense bro <U+0001F60A>"
"12255","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures Awesome movie...... But please work on dialogues ""touch my staff and say my name""..... The entire theater laughed <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"12256","#Shazam is a really fun movie to watch liked it more than i thought i would, better improvement from previous DC films"
"12257","It shoulda been Top Flight of the World, Craig.

Superman had to reduce Shazam back to a boy or he would still be getting his a$$ whooped to this day."
"12258","Shazam one sentence review. Two years ago I would have never thought that DC's Trinity would be  Wonder Woman, Aquaman and @ShazamMovie"
"12259","@Jordan_Fisher Please confirm or deny that you are in the final scene of Shazam!!!"
"12260","Thundercrack of course"
"12261","@ShazamMovie is FANTASTIC! HILARIOUS, heartwarming, the sly references...lots of fun. Zachary Levi and Asher Angel together as Billy/Shazam, it's brilliant. Love it, love it, love it! Will be seeing it again! #SHAZAM"
"12262","I just realized the last 3 movies I’ve seen in theaters were Into The Spiderverse, Captain Marvel, &amp; Shazam superhero movies are takig over my life"
"12263","I have just seen #SHAZAM with the most awesome people on the planet and it is glorious fun, we loved it. 

The BIG reference had me laughing hard."
"12264","Oh crap, @ShazamMovie released this weekend. I guess I was confused when the official release was going to be because of that weird Fandango pre-screening promotion. Thought it was next weekend. Guess I'll be going to see it tomorrow. #Shazam"
"12265","Retweeting for greater visibility"
"12266","also i know im not gunna see shazam! in theaters bc im poor lazy and dont really care about the movie that much! but i does look funny so i know ill watch it eventually. ill do my own research on jack and see if its an illegal situation or maybe i can rent it/it’ll go on a"
"12267","@GeoffreyMiller Plot Twist. Aric is really Shazam IRL"
"12268","Shazam ! is a BLAST ! My jaw and cheeks were hurting from laughing. Geoff Johns’ New 52 Shazam brought to the big screen. The tonal balance is perfect, emotional and touching when it needs to be, gleeful and fun at other times, sometimes menacing. There’s so much heart and spirit"
"12269","that one’s on Warner Bros). I want more and more and more. #SHAZAM"

"12272","I figure it corny"
"12273","I always win I never lose fatass nation"
"12274","@allthingshulk I really gotta read that comic. Also Shazam/Superman first thunder"
"12275","Shazam! was great. @ZacharyLevi never disappoints, and the two young leads also carry the movie with their memorable performances. My only critique is the implausibility of Shazam catching that bus by the windshield without the glass breaking. That’s some seriously strong glass!"
"12276","Saw Shazam in a movie theater last night on a date. Great movie, but the glasses were a hassle and there was a lot of sentences missing...  I didn’t wanna ruin my date and complain, so I just tried to fill in the blanks, but god dammit @RegalMovies check your damn captions."
"12277","@ShazamMovie it's just awesome...
Rush to your nearest theatres!!!!
@ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi"
"12278","I need to spend 10 hours at the movies to finally see Us, Pet Semetery, Captain Marvel, Shazam! and Dumbo
wish me luck"
"12279","oof about to watch #SHAZAM"
"12280","Weird. I didn't even notice the original Superman theme in #Shazam. But its really wild they used the theme from BvS in that one scene."
"12281","im so excited to see shazam tonight after work omg"
"12282","i’m forcing my family to take me to see shazam today <U+0001F92A><U+0001F92A> i’m big excited"
"12283","So SHAZAM was great, it was funny and really cool and just the tones of family were really great. Yeah I loved it."
"12284","i’m so excited to see shazam today wooooooo"
"12285","I watched @ShazamMovie with my best friend today who didn't know shit about DC. But after watching the movie, we went to take our lunch and every time he belched he said SHAZAM. LMAO! Shazam is an excellent superhero movie packed with entertainment and action."
"12286","@LightsCameraPod @JeffDLowe I thought this movie was awesome. Most superhero movies have a so-so end fight, but this end fight was dope too. Looking forward to seeing more Shazam. DC is officially on a hot streak"
"12287","@Jasper_Reviews It was amazing. Had a lot of unexpected moments. If people are gonna compare it with Marvel films, I'd say Shazam is way better than most of the MCU."
"12288","@mykbrv You’re right about the dark knight. But the dark knight wasnt a DCEU movie. I think shazam was a really great and there isnt a movie quite like it. So I think it might be right to say its one of the best DCEU movies right now."
"12289","Please reply with certain things you want to see about Ellie. (iTunes, Shazam, Youtube, Spotify, other?) @ChartsEG also updates more than me, so follow them as well."
"12290","Now showing at The @CommodoreTheatr @ShazamMovie @DCComics @wbpictures #SHAZAM"
"12291","I probably shouldnt be surprised shazam is pretty stacked out this weekend but even on the sunday? Pretty weird to see somewhere so busy."
"12292","Critics seem to think Shazam can compete with Marvel films. I think not."
"12293","a bunch of little kids came into my job today all wearing shazam merch and my heart was full"
"12294","This guy that doesn't even like Shazam and speaks to lowly of DC. Psssst."
"12295","You all saying shazam is boring I don't even trust you guys I'm just waiting for @Txtwistatornado To watch it so she can give me her own comment"
"12296","people who saw Venom in the cinema and didn’t bother to go see this deserve public execution"
"12297","I saw Shazam! yesterday. It was actually pretty good. Definitely a fun movie and aside from some swearing, it’s a great family super hero movie. It even had a Goonies vibe. Lots of comedy and fun action. Lots of good characters too. Just a few cheesy parts &amp; plot holes.
Score: B-"
"12298","The twitter reviews of Shazam are really confusing 

The people who like it reaaallly like it because it’s funny and the people who hate it reaaallly hate it because it’s boring"
"12299","My best friend would have the super power to grow 6 inches because he is only short"
"12300","Me: *logs on twitter*

*scrolls thru* sees:

- some task guy all SJW about SS
- some tool posting Shazam spoilers
- something about Martha &amp; rimming
- lots of people swearing @ each other

also me: so how many of you find that blue m&amp;ms really stain your hands?"
"12301","Off to see #SHAZAM"
"12302","I went and watched #Shazam last night and I liked the movie. It was filled with lots of laughter and emotion throughout the whole movie. There was more comedy and few action, but the action sequences were awesome! There are a few dark moments in the film that will surprise y'all!"
"12303","As for the dark moments in the #Shazam movie, once you see it, you'll be thinking, ""Wow, I can't believe it didn't get an R rating due to these moments."" Overall, it was an amazing movie and there is a surprise treat in the movie that I won't spoil. Go see it and have fun!"
"12304","@Earth9DC @getyourcomicon @JackGeekstalk @SuperheroPOLL @PodcastHQ @EmeraldArcher1_ @wehaveahulkpod @xgeeks @knee4marvelvsdc Shazam. Hope he joins the justice league. Wonder Woman and Aquaman were great too."
"12305","#Shazam was a pretty good film! I would recommend it, it's not like another typical DC film, well acted and played.

I also forgot how much I love going to the cinema, I love getting emersed in the screen and the story (that's gonna get me with #AvengersEndgame later when I cry)"
"12306","Guys, my kid and I just finished watching Shazam! and it is a thousand times better than I expected.  Go, go now."
"12307","why the hell am I seeing spoilers for Shazam already? it’s only been a few days since it’s been out. how about letting people be surprised when they watch the film??"
"12308","@sukit_eazyyy Captain marvel was boring and Shazam looks even more boring in my opinion"
"12309","Such a nice day outside, can't wait till the week starts 3 shoots. Seen one good movie this month to shazam next movie ill be seeing is Avengers in a few weeks."
"12310","Should I go and see Shazam or is it bad?"
"12311","@Russo_Brothers I prefer see #Shazam"
"12312","Not because of bad blood but because it freed him to do Shazam."
"12313","I saw the movie Shazam this weekend. I loved it. It did a wonderful job of portraying the white mom as a total piece of shit human being. She strait left her kid at a carnival. Lol holy shit I was yelling at the movie screen."
"12314","Shout out to #TNT for having a day dedicated to the #DCEU, coinciding with this weekend's release of #Shazam. If you're bumming around at home today they're showing Man of Steel, BvS, and Suicide Squad back-to-back-to-back."
"12315","I loved the Toy Story reference in Shazam!"
"12316","I still need to see Captain Marvel but I also wanna see Pet Semetary.. and also Shazam probably"
"12317","Time to watch Shazam again, this time in Ukranian version not Russian. Be back later."

Reeve captured the tone and personality of Superman so well. So when he got upset or angry you really felt it, like when Lois died. Nothing should phase him &amp; when it does you know it serious."
"12332","Ok. #Shazam was a nice fun ride. @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel y’all did that. The entire cast was incredible. Laughs. Heart. All of it."

"12334","@BergersBeauty @ShazamMovie So many things we want to see - and this is one."
"12335","@TCDoesComics The built in trust kinda makes sense. Looking at it from a GA perspective, Shazam didn't look like a movie you had to watch, but Captain Marvel was not only another part of the MCU but a part of understanding Endgame."
"12336","we're in April right now, Avengers: Endgame is right around the corner, Shazam was great..... but we still got nothing on Star Wars: Episode IX.

"12343","Saw Shazam today. It was really good and I'm starting to prefer DC over Marvel. The post credits scene hinting at the sequel was really well done. The other post credits with the goldfish was really funny too. #Shazam"

"12345","#Shazam was the cutest movie!!! It’s got me excited about DC movies."

"12357","@ThePlaylist I know that sounds like a low bar, but Shazam! doesn't really need to do anything more than that theatrically. Its appeal to kids guarantees it'll have a long secondary life on DVD/streaming, and the critical/audience reaction means a boost for future DC movies. This is a win."
"12358","Update: it was pretty good. Refreshing take on a superhero movie, second only to Spiderverse in the past year IMO"
"12359","@IamCarrieagain It’s magnificent ! I also highly recommend Shazam"
"12360","@JayFingers @ShazamMovie Well...it is for a certain group of kids. :-)"

"12541","The reason why Shazam isn’t my favorite is mainly the lack of spectacle. The action is fun and so ingenious, and I love how emotional the story is. It works great! But the climax, while fun and clever, didn’t speak to me. It didn’t feel satisfying enough. I needed more.

Ah well."

"12550","#ShazamMovie was great. 5/5.  Stay for midcredits and postcredit scenes, too.

If you've read the recent reboots, not much of the film will surprise you.

My six year old son is surprising us by repeating the family moment at the dinner table."
"12551","In some @IMAX theatres, apparently."
"12552","I actually really enjoyed Shazam. It's the most true to the comic superhero movie I think I've seen from DC. So amazing. The only downside was the guy sitting next to me chewing on his empty water bottle the entire movie. It was like he was a child sucking on a bottle...Manbaby"

"12576","the endgame trailer playing before shazam is so funny to me"
"12577","@ZacharyLevi Shazam! Was one of the best movies this year so far. The way how you played Shazam was amazing. You really do know how to be a kid."
"12578","#Shazam was pretty fun. It being so tongue and cheek with itself was a smart move. No way would anyone take such a silly premise seriously. The final act dragged a bit but it was still a good time."
"12579","Did I just see Shazam yesterday?
Yes.
Am I currently on my way to the movie theater to see it again?
Mind your own business."

"12600","One of the funniest scene <U+0001F602>"
"12601","@BobDigi69 @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie The ""snyder cut"" is not a real thing. No cgi was completed so if you want to see people run around on green screens then go for it but WB isn't going to drop 50mil in effects for some whiners online. If anything ask for the script snyder wrote to be released then you might get it"

"12609","156) Shazam! @ Galewood. My 2nd time. Such a lot of fun! Loved all the characters (except Sivana, what a dick, to be a bad guy out of spite!) and would love to have grown up in the Vasquez family with or without superhero siblings."
"12610","157) Captain Marvel @ Galewood. 9th time, yes? It was a perfect double-feature with Shazam! I don't understand why people feel the need to pit the movies against each other, then, I don't understand Marvel vs. DC rivalry either. I just enjoy them all and have fun."
"12611","#Shazam is a love letter to the rest of the DCEU. Even if you aren’t a DC fan, watch Shazam, it’s worth your time. <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"12612","@BasiliskOnline @Abstruse I did appreciate the nods to the larger universe in Shazam. And I know that there are budget and commercial considerations.

It boils down to I spend too much time thinking about these things I guess.

Overall, I really liked the movie and am looking forward to the sequel."
"12613","@TheCrazyAsshole @gavinfeng97 Agreed, and i love the MCU!

"12721","This guy @ZacharyLevi, man-O-man, has pulled off a stunner. What a treat it was to watch him essaying the role of Shazam to perfection. I think I can say it out loud, that he has nailed it. It was so enthralling watching him conquer the screen. #Shazam"
"12722","@RobertGarciaLB It was so great - just imagine how huge Black Adam will be once more eyeballs see how phenomenal #Shazam is!"
"12723","#Shazam - which I’m watching the credits for now, was absolutely amazing from frame one to the post credits scene<U+0001F60D> Absolutely loved it as did my entire family. Could honestly watch it again right now"
"12724","Lol - I was literally just thinking that as @TheRock is listed as a producer in the credits <U+0001F609>"
"12725","Had the best time with my best friends today. @ShazamMovie @Louisa_337 #alice #besttimes #bestmates #lovetheseguys #Easter #moviemates #eatingout #besties"
"12726","Shazam! Gave us an Asian superhero and a gay superhero and it was really fun. Could use more gayness but for now I’m happy"
"12727","@CWWeir @1moreGaryFrank @BittrScrptReadr I get that. The one with wings sure stood out to me. I think the idea was more about giving a villain besides Black Adam. I don’t know enough about Shazam yet to think up more, but I like the idea of the villain/villains being such a recognizable idea."
"12728","Thank you @ZacharyLevi !!! Shazam! Is AWESOME!! I knew it would be from before hand, watching Chuck, but seeing the movie is even better than I figured it would be!"
"12729","The Queen supporting #Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"12730","@Earth9DC Thank you! I love Man of Steel movie more than the Shazam movie and I run an account dedicated to Shazam lol 

I miss Reeve, such a hero on/off the screen! He was someone I always looked up to. He embodied the role and so has Henry Cavill...

May the wisdom of Solomon be with you"
"12731","Can't take a decision by myself so: should I watch Shazam! in theater or wait till it's online?"
"12732","i love zachary levi so much and yes this is disney relevant because he’s flynn rider

pls see shazam bc zachary is a gem"
"12733","I’ve been reading soo many good about Shazam I’m excited"
"12734","@ShazamMovie @JamesGavsie This movie was Awesome. I had so much fun watching this, and cant wait for more Shazam and family in the future!"
"12735","SHAZAM! is even funnier than the DEADPOOL movies and much less inside baseball. It's the best modern attempt at a superhero comedy, and kids can see it too."
"12736","Can't wait to see Shazam! again when my midterm exams are over and buy it on Blu-Ray."
"12737","He had the name before she did? I mean that's literally it."
"12738","@Sarcasm_Persona I truly believe the way we talk about Spider-Man (2002) is gonna be how kids talk about Shazam."
"12739","@Earth9DC @getyourcomicon @JackGeekstalk @SuperheroPOLL @PodcastHQ @EmeraldArcher1_ @wehaveahulkpod @xgeeks @knee4marvelvsdc #WonderWoman is my favourite DC comic. And one of my favourites overall. Though thus far it's the only one I've really enjoyed... I'm looking forward to seeing Shazam though."
"12740","@ShazamMovie has merited the @JamesBuechele stamp of approval. Congrats, and the rest of you are now on notice. Go see it."
"12741","@BlackMajikMan90 @Bosco685 @Luiz_Fernando_J that's why for the sequel they need to put a bit of edge in the sequel. Go all out if you have to with Black Adam and maybe put Superman in the movie. Have Shazam travel around the world taking pictures etc."
"12742","@PatrckStatic Passengers (Chris Pratt+Jennifer Lawrence), Scooby Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed and (as of yesterday) SHAZAM!!"
"12743","A day has passed since I saw #Shazam . Still thinking the movie (vividly) in my head"
"12744","@ZacharyLevi so my daughter tuned 7 today and wanted to go see Dumbo so i brought her to see #Shazam she loved every minute of  and finally got her excited about superheroes for that i thank you. Shazam was amazing so full of heart and joy. Well done Sir #Shazam #DC"
"12745","@ZacharyLevi so my daughter tuned 7 today and want to go see Dumbo i brought her to see #Shazam loved every minute of her and finally got her excited about superheroes for that i thank you. Shazam was amazing so full of heart and joy. Well done Sir #Shazam #DC"
"12746","@pedroangelnsc @snarkknight01 I've lost exactly 1 follower since i posted that picture so... I couldn't care less about people who are not following me. They can go and see it or mute Shazam untill they see it."
"12747","Year is 2044 it has been 30 years since Rock has been cast as Black Adam. Now movie finally found it's director and script is almost ready. Geoff Johns told us to prepare our best comic book moments list because we will change it after Black Adam is released."
"12748","MY OPINION:
I think Shazam was...........ok. Nothing special.
Like I had a fun theater experience, but it definetily doesn't belong to a high quality DCEU movie list. Beautiful meaning in the movie, but it could have been a classic, with a more proper directing style. 
6.5/10 ."
"12749","@jeffzzzz99 I agree and disagree

After seeing Supermans face in josstice league, if I saw shazam ending with more superman face memes

I would have been physically sick in the cinema

so I see it as public health warning, who ever posts that superman pic"
"12750","@PraiseSnyder I would have fucked something up

YOU THINK with Josstice beginning with that Superman, and then Shazam ending with that Superman...THAT IT would have gone well for people who Stan superman."
"12751","Question Time. Twice<U+0001F602>

If you saw Supermans face in Josstice league before you saw the film would you have seen it?

If you SAID NO, do you blame people showing supermans face in shazam early now?"
"12752","Still needa see Pet Sematary and Shazam forgot they came out already fuccc<U+0001F974>"
"12753","Ain’t nothing strange about touching on toxic masculinity"
"12754","I already got basically a major Shazam spoiler"
"12755","I just wanted to watch Shazam :(((((("
"12756","I’m seriously sobbing over not being able to watch Shazam"
"12757","I can’t stop crying bc I’m not seeing Shazam today :((((( I just wanted to watch it it’s the only thing I think about all the time I can’t believe it’s been out for like 5 days and I still haven’t watch it"
"12758","I don’t think I’ll even be watching Shazam at the cinema ever. My mom creates SO many excuses."
"12759","In 15 minutes I was supposed to be seeing Shazam but I won’t so yeah let’s keep crying for like 2h30 in tribute to the movie"
"12760","The one in Shazam. Deadpool 2's X-Men got nothing on it"
"12761","Lowest? It really deserve it"
"12762","Seriously great job by @ZacharyLevi and two of my other favorite actors (who I won’t spoil) from two of my favorite TV series (one set in farm country and the other on an island)...seriously...don’t read the cast list on IMDB and allow yourself to be surprised! #Shazam"
"12763","#Shazam was a great movie! So different than the other recent DC movies that I’m not sure it’s even fair to rank it on the list. Fun family film."
"12764","@Apple big 2019 and I still can’t Shazam a song on my own phone &amp; use my phone whilst airing a call, fix up"
"12765","About to see it. Hopefully I enjoy it!"
"12766","seeing shazam in like 40 minutes and just realized I’m in a marvel shirt"
"12767","Just watched Shazam. I loved it. Gave me that nostalgic feeling I had as a kid when I watched a movie I really loved like The Sandlot. Kinda the feeling I got when I watched Stranger Things. I didn’t expect to like it as much as I did."
"12768","When The Ramones started playing over the closing credits of Shazam, I thought it was their cover of the Spider-man theme which would obviously be an odd choice. Then the lyrics kicked in and I realized it wasn't. Point of the story: I love The Ramones but they only have one song"
"12769","ever since i got out of watching shazam i cant stop saying holy moly JFJSJFJSJ"
"12770","@mustbtaste yes im so excited for the joker movie! and it’s not supposed to be connected to the dceu, it’s set in a whole other universe so it has no ties to ww, shazam etc, but im excited nonetheless! it looks really good and im happy theyre trying different things than following the +"
"12771","Seeing Meagan Good in Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F> was one of my fav parts"
"12772","#Shazam could be DC's most crowd-pleasing movie yet. As their follow-up to Aquaman, it really serves to solidify their new direction, post Snyder. Which is to pretty much just copy the tone of the MCU, but with terrifying horror elements sprinkled in for no good reason!"
"12773","my mum and her boyfriend are currently watching shazam in the cinema, i’m jealous asf. but instead i have to babysit, fun times."
"12774","@Rose_Mclean2519 It had the Shazam name on it. I will send you a picture of the car."
"12775","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover Zac did do a great job. He brought the character of Shazam to life like no one could. John you did a great job as Thad’s dad. The movie itself is amazing and definitely worth going out and seeing it."
"12776","Many many people asked for it so here it is.

Create your Justice League team with the first @ who appears 

Bat Man: 
Wonder Woman:
Aqua Man: 
Cyborg: 
Flash:
Shazam:
Meera:
Superman:

Quite a crowd"
"12777","Think I’m going to go see Shazam later"
"12778","@1moreGaryFrank @ZacharyLevi I hope you come to @Showmasters London Film and Comic-Con or @DublinComicCon I loved your and @geoffjohns work on the Shazam comic (it's definitely one of my favourite comics!)"
"12779","I loved the creature design in Shazam."
"12780","Thanks to DC Comics i have two favorite DC superheroes: Wonder Woman and @ShazamMovie. They're just so good to be ignored."
"12781","Shazam is pretty good. It would be cool for the Rock to be in the next one."
"12782","Shazam: the first DC movie that didn’t suck."
"12783","Dear @ZacharyLevi... Ioved you in @nbcchuck... thought were amazing in @ShazamMovie! Way to go!!! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"

"12785","someone go with me to see shazam"
"12786","@rdjsdigbick Yea but the movie is about Shazam"
"12787","Ya’ll know that ad of Shazam flossing?

That’s the only form of flossing I’ll accept. Any other kind is just...kill it with fire"
"12788","the lomls"
"12789","Shazam and instant family def been the best movies I saw this week ..."
"12790","I totally agree with it! #ShazamMovie"
"12791","no one wants to go watch shazam with me <U+0001F614>"
"12792","Shazam is just a Fast and Furious movie"
"12793","i don’t understand?? does this mean they would’ve used gal or jason someone else or jusy use another actor for superman???"
"12794","lrt like shazam really coming for vision huh"
"12795","Shazam was a great movie! The part where they all turned into a family of Shazams was cringe (extra cringe for Megan Fox) but it was soooooo funny and so human. 8/10 would recommend"
"12796","The least realistic part of #Shazam was when none of the uploads were demonetized"
"12797","Adored Shazam, so much fun and so much heart"
"12798","#Shazam was great 
I sure everyone is going to complain like they always do."
"12799","Just got back from #Shazam and I have to say it is one of the most funny fun entertaining films I have see in a while. I really enjoyed that one."
"12800","@KevinGregorioTF @AndrewK300 @EthanVanSciver I just liked Shazam. That’s all I wanted to say :)"
"12801","@ZacharyLevi Just saw #Shazam #thetruecaptainmarvel for the second time and its awesome! You were born to play Shazam <U+0001F919><U+26A1> #lightinginyourhands"
"12802","@ZacharyLevi you can call me Max...SHAZAM!  The Fam is ready for movie No. 2."
"12803","@Geekedoutnation @cgibsonREX 1. I ain’t seen it yet 2. Infinity war is regarded as one of/the best CB movie of all time, Shazam is not even in the same league! You’re clearly not getting my point are you <U+0001F602>"
"12804","#Shazam and then dinner. <U+0001F929>"
"12805","God, 90% of the kids in Shazam are fucking annoying"
"12806","so i just saw shazam and when legend played i almost started crying"
"12807","Great time at the movies with the fam. Thanks #Shazam @ZacharyLevi."
"12808","Shazam is better than anything the MCU could put out now, their satirical Deadpool without being obnoxious. DC was so smart to abandon the faux Nolan seriousness. I feel like I can breathe. A kid’s spirit is alive here. 5/5"
"12809","so what are the essential shazam buys that are on this comixology sale?"
"12810","Man, lil Darla ""SHAZAM""ed into @MeaganGood !!!!!!(WOW)
Better movie than I thought it would be"
"12811","@gamingmentor101 @AceKiddoInReal @fincherism He’s kind of a stand in for douchey men as a whole. Like all diversity is good, but diversity that isn’t even talked about is the best. Just let diverse people exist like in Shazam or us or spiderverse without focusing all the advertising or attention on the diversity"
"12812","@HackinTimSeeley Yeah honestly I enjoyed Shazam! So much more than BVS."
"12813","Shazam was actually a pretty damn good movie. I totally thought that Freddy was similar to a young Seth Cohen so the fact that Adam Brody played Superhero Freddy was just perfect."
"12814","When God created @RealJohnGlover he planned for him to interpret all the nasty fathers in the DC universe. #Shazam"
"12815","@Signs2323 I might have went ahead and went and seen #Shazam even after saying I wouldn't because it's just an MCU movie but this ""cameo"" is too fucking shameful for me to even bother with the movie at all.

We need to send WB a message that we're tired of their shit"
"12816","@cut_release And it turns out we still don’t recognize him, cuz he’s got no fucking head in Shazam. I mean this is simply unacceptable"
"12817","We lost, an all time great Superman saga, to have to endure his awful appearance in Josstice league, how he’s headless in Shazam, with the Williams theme. We don’t even know if Cavill is returning(prob not) this is exactly the time, for FANS to say fuck this shit"
"12818","Superman is my fav character of all time, by far. I don’t care if you liked Shazam or not. Putting a headless Superman in a cameo, after being established already in 3 movies, is PATHETIC! It was awful, and no fan should accept that. Just declare it’s fucking absurd and move on"
"12819","@TheMarvelvsDC The Russo Brothers directing a DC movie?   Hell yeah!!!!  If they’re able to make a movie as great as Aquaman or Shazam, I’m down for that!!"
"12820","Second film of the day - and no. 25 of the year - #Shazam! I really felt this was just OK. Uninteresting villain, paper thin plot, and the youngest sister was painfully annoying. 20 mins less on the run time and I would’ve enjoyed this more. #cineworldunlimited #100filmsin2019"
"12821","Go watch shazam pls go see a superhero film packed with more diversity on it's first try than Marvel's managed in ten years"
"12822","@trilliaventuras I might be getting out of pet sematary around the time you finish Shazam"
"12823","Me walking out of Shazam thinking about all the potential of DC movies there could be if they’d stop making Batman movies: Like an animated Dex-Starr movie? THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!"
"12824","I'm a little surprised that Shazam didnt do better at box office this weekend. $53 mil. I thought it would do better"
"12825","also i know the actress playing the adult version of the black girl, great pic dude! I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this #Shazam"
"12826","why havent every police, fireman and paramedic show up to help injured people from this giant fucking attack
and tell me is this a new xmas movie we gotta see? #Shazam"
"12827","i like this villain he feels fleshed out just the reason to fight doesnt make sense but he's logical and isnt evil just to be evil #Shazam"
"12828","then kid slamming superman and batman toys in front of the window is perfect
kid sees the hero this feels like how TLJ should've felt watchin the slave boy use the force #Shazam"
"12829","yeah wasnt that thing falling a half hour ago
also the black girl can use her powers better than the rest and Im 100% in love with it #Shazam"
"12830","right now finding out his mother abandoned him should make billy just turn evil why doesnt he have billy join him #Shazam"
"12831","this movie was good; the meta jokes and humor really landed. it totally feels like wana be spiderman homecoming but DC needed something like this. I could pick it apart but overall it's fun for the whole family despite being full of cliches
90% #Shazam"
"12832","i still say this foster famly sucks at being parents i mean theyre good but they left those kids all alone and shit for hours #Shazam"
"12833","this kid some basic internet search and found his mom and kid doesn't even care or thank him like wasn't this your main goal? i  get it a kid is easily distracted but wasnt it night time a few mins ago? #Shazam"
"12834","actor playing shazam really makes this movie great; perfect charismaand everything
also they cant help but bring the snyder slow mo out once lol #Shazam"
"12835","yeah like wouldn't some government superhero response team be called in anytime a villain shows up? #Shazam"
"12836","also i dont  get why they have the hero and villain  have to fight each other, like just go elsewhere he doesnt know wtf to do? or just kil him as a kid, brother was just sayin his name #Shazam"
"12837","somehow his lightning bolt always works for whatever 
him using raiden is funny product placemenet too
also how did they get al lthat crap into the foster family home #Shazam"
"12838","like he's got the staff whocares if billy is alive like literally these demons foroced the plot into happening when they could've done their thing and nobody would've stopepd them
dogs playing poker? oh crocodiles #Shazam"
"12839","seriously i love this black girl if she dies im done w/ this movie #Shazam"
"12840","i like billy trying to figure out how to be a hero  but is a total idiot; that would so be me #Shazam"
"12841","right outta the comics, him jumping off the building yelling shazam; awesome
now it gets predictable #Shazam"
"12842","why is everyone around him is he pretending to be a big shot with lieabetes
wearing a superman shirt; I feel for this kid though #Shazam"
"12843","seriously whats up with these bullies?? #Shazam"
"12844","I mean they all have lunch at the same time?
and school is fine w/ this adult just walking in
WHERE ARE TEACHERS? 
#Shazam"
"12845","one of my super powers is name guessing #Shazam"
"12846","wait so billy can transport them away with a thought? is that a form of magic? #Shazam"
"12847","she did almost die by walking in front of the truck wtf
#Shazam"
"12848","also knows how to fight a little, maybe not on a super level but a super gut punch is nice #Shazam"
"12849","she's totally cool talking to this random guy who i guess she knows is a hero 
btw SHE JUST ALMOST DIED #Shazam"
"12850","problem is now every goddamn year we're gonna have #Shazam debate as is it a christmas movie or a movie that takes place AT christmas"
"12851","no one else pointed out that he caused the bus accident?? #Shazam"
"12852","so was that cavill as superman? it was dope af plus i guess this is post justice league? #Shazam"
"12853","and then bily just walks to wherever his mom is like wouldnt you immediatley power up and fly there? #Shazam"
"12854","you can clearly tell Billy and shazam are different characters because his teen form is a brooding little shit but the hero one is jubilant, charismatic and happy #Shazam"
"12855","honeslty this actors charisma sells the shazam character; makes you wonder why you'd even want to be in human form?
also the kids wearing an atlantean lifeguard shirt w/ aquaman logo !!!! wtf #Shazam"
"12856","this is why you don't livve in a city with superheroes man at any moment you could have your whole world destroyed
santa running makes sense tho #Shazam"
"12857","seriously where are his foster parents they just abandoned those kids? doesnt anyone check up? #Shazam"
"12858","super powers would be a narcotic #Shazam"
"12859","hero just flyin away from the villain but his lightning doesnt seem to affect him #Shazam"
"12860","the kid threw a batarang and i love LOVE how the family shows up
oh shit and it cut his head
so even billy and the audience see that when they leave him he's mortal
NICE! #Shazam"
"12861","right he's famous from youtube so he should've switched to his human form
then he does so derp #Shazam"
"12862","that lil girl is tough dude she's the mvp of this movie #Shazam"
"12863","all the batman toys
then he does the BIG piano walk to fully illustrate, yes this is a boy in a mans body #Shazam"
"12864","still love this little black girl she's the true star of the movie #Shazam"
"12865","@DT2ComicsChat watching #Shazam and if this took place in a real world, you were a teenager kid that could turn into this, would you ever revert back to your regular form?"
"12866","seriously the looking for a base and it sounds like batcave is pretty funny; plot doesnt move along but I'd rather  just them screwin around that would be a fun movie too #Shazam"
"12867","hero saves the villiain in the  nick of time #Shazam"
"12868","they write all the test video in russian too #Shazam"
"12869","see he turns into a dork when in hero form which is funny but the kid doesn't act that way at all #Shazam"
"12870","ok i get it they're kids I'd be uploading my youtube videos of me being a superhero that's funny
""locomotive? what are you an old prospector""
and he tries to jump a building thats funny #Shazam"
"12871","zappin the product placement #Shazam"
"12872","HAHAHAH he can't hear him tlaking okay that's super funny
wow way to undercut the vilain but perfect dude #Shazam"
"12873","why is he gonan call him a bully? he was just using him #Shazam"
"12874","maybe its swagger, knowing you're basically a god
also why do all these kids have lunch together? #Shazam"
"12875","pretty much just hold hishead underwater, this should be over in ten seconds #Shazam"
"12876","this is cute the family fighting the demons but doesnt that leave magic eye kinda powerless? #Shazam"
"12877","god im so sick of these bullies are they from the comic? theyre as useless as bulk and skull #Shazam"
"12878","these things that were so strong only wizard could seal them away but a bunch of suped up teenagers can handle them without stress

GET OUT OF A HERO CITY NOW #Shazam"
"12879","oh surprise she's still married/dating an asshole whos probably abusive #Shazam"
"12880","seriously just dont fight him dude you can unleash all the evil, this feels like a forced conflict #Shazam"
"12881","the black chick using bullet time to save heroes like she's quicksilver i love this dude i mean narratively they're basically unstoppable so there's no stakes but it makes the movie super fun #Shazam"
"12882","these two actors really aren't even on teh same page like theyre both good but HUGE tonal difference between the hero and the teen characters, very different people #Shazam"
"12883","also none of the kids look scared at the demons that were there a min ago they were screaming from #Shazam"
"12884","this montage is good for story purrposes, shows him learning powers &amp; its limits along with the audience
but why would you upload them online? #Shazam"
"12885","this villain is a discount Zod also h es wearing sunglasses at night to save costs? and santa has to yell run? why wouldnt you run from an evil dude floating
like wouldnt the city be on lockdown after that mall thing? #Shazam"
"12886","DAMN mom saw him and said, eh screw it #Shazam"
"12887","the testing hero powers montage is cute #Shazam"
"12888","these foster siblings sure bonded with him 
and they just abandon the kids right away?? #Shazam"
"12889","like if a super hero showed up in your hometown wouldn't you immediately want to move because a villain inevitably shows up and that means lots of collateral damage; insurance hikes and tons of paparazzi trying to get video of him @DT2ComicsChat #Shazam"
"12890","when he gives advice is he using the knowledge of solomon? #Shazam"
"12891","i like his lightnig basically almost killed some people, like this is why marvel had a civil war to prvent this shit #Shazam"
"12892","the tiger, cute, because mr tawny or whatever from the comics #Shazam"
"12893","why can they suddenly g rab the smoke demons btw? #Shazam"

"12895","Suicide Squad is the only movie Shazam is better than...."
"12896","im going to see shazam with my family hopefully i laugh at least a little because i havent smiled all day"
"12897","The movie #Shazam is better than the #Avengers ... #ChangeMyMind"
"12898","Dwayne Johnson looks so beautifully excited with being Black Adam, with his movie and Shazam, man... can't wait for him to shine in the DCEU."
"12899","@KelvinDetroit yup. It's nice out over here. I hope #WrestleMania can get me out of this funk. Oh, and Shazam was pretty cool, too."
"12900","@RTSnyderCut Sure glad this was brought up and that all intent was to have Henry Cavill there to do the cameo. Hopefully this will calm some fans that are still in uproar over this. Scheduling is a bitch! Oh and @WBHomeEnt #ReleaseTheSnyderCut !!!"
"12901","Shazam was solid but it mostly made me wish that Chuck was still on Netflix so I could watch more Zachary Levi playing somebody who magically gains a bunch of powers and has to learn how to use them"
"12902","My review of Shazam is that it's okay but it's just another movie that's praised more just because it isn't Suicide Squad."
"12903","@sSLaDe_WiLSoNn @ponysmasher No, the character that is the same in Lights Out and Shazam is the social worker, played by Andi Osho."
"12904","I’m happy DC was actually able to make Shazam a good movie"
"12905","@IMDBorg People will forget Shazam after three weeks? I'm still super fresh after two and don't see myself forgetting it in a few days.

Also the responders seem to live in an alternate reality where Affleck was replaced and didn't leave on his own accord."
"12906","I’ve already had THAT shazam cameo ruined for me bc people posted the pic without tagging it as a spoiler lol fuck this site"
"12907","@wbpictures make the right decision and #ReleaseTheSnyderCut . It means a lot for us the fans. @RTSnyderCut"
"12908","I saw #Shazam the other night and it was a pleasant surprise. The chemistry between the main characters was great. If only the villain wasn't so lame. Daddy issues are a very uninteresting motivating factor for creating an evil empire."
"12909","“Zach, a lot of us have known you were a superhero for a long time. I’m glad that now the rest of the world does too!”

DC actors supporting zachary levi is making me cry <U+0001F62D>"
"12910","#Shazam is good popcorn fluff. Nothing wrong with that. It may be a little too paint by the numbers for some but it knew what it was and didn’t try to be anything other than light hearted fun."
"12911","@ThatMissQuin @clowniegiggles @JaysusMcJaysus The film just looks eh to me but who knows. I thought Shazam would be a kids film and I was wrong."
"12912","@Luiz_Fernando_J Looks pretty decent. Hopefully more will flow in for Shazam. The next installment of this is gonna be Black Adam. Can't wait to hear more from that film. Rock finally playing a comicbook character. It just doesn't get any better than that <U+0001F60E>"
"12913","#Shazam! Was very good. Fun. Funny. Lots of heart. By far the most “Marvel” of the DC films. 

Best scene? The big “hell yah” moment in the climactic battle. 

Most emotional? The family dinners."
"12914","Also this my favourite so far of the recent DC films. More films like #Shazam!, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman and DC will have caught up to Marvel and be extremely strong competition."
"12915","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi This made me day <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FB>"
"12916","@MarkKolpack @ArcLightCinemas @ShazamMovie Stay to the VERY end, there are two post-credit scenes, one in the middle, the other at the end."
"12917","@doomcock Billy naturally takes time to build confidence. #Shazam is as it should be. Complete with piano homage to Big."
"12918","@JeanLucMeisel @TransformARO I do agree that the 3rd act could of used a bigger punch. But this is usually the case with most super hero origin stories. That they save bigger obstacles for later outings.

If all goes well, when Shazam finally faces Black Adam, is should be really amazing. <U+0001F91E><U+0001F91E>"
"12919","so i went to go see #ShazamMovie yesterday, and i loved it"
"12920","@EJ_Braithwaite This is so sweet! <U+0001F970><U+0001F970><U+0001F970> I bet his favorite superhero will be Shazam! From now on huh? <U+0001F970><U+0001F970> And Im glad you’re going to see it again. I’ve done it 4 times already and I’m planning on watching it some more this week"
"12921","I can’t decide who of the @ShazamMovie kids I like the most! I have a little bit of Mary and Darla inside of me. Pedro and Eugene are literally copies of my boys haha. And who wouldn’t love Billy and Freddy? I’m telling yo, I don’t know which kid I like the most! <U+0001F970><U+0001F970><U+0001F970><U+0001F970>"
"12922","My ratings for DCEU movies by far:
Man of Steel: 9/10
Batman v Superman: 10/10
Suicide Squad: 2/10
Wonder Woman: 6/10
Justice League: 2.5/10
Aquaman: 6/10
Shazam!: 4/10"
"12923","Sorry that I'm basically typing spoiler for Shazam at this point, but I have to say something about these fools"
"12924","todos  &lt;3
Playing With Fire"
"12925","Again, more common sense than a lot of people on the internet."
"12926","Well, I just muted half a dozen accounts for blatant Shazam spoilers. If you don’t want to see it, fine. Don’t. But don’t be a dick to those who do. Being courteous takes minimal effort. In this case, literally NO effort. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"12927","Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand I'm of to go see #Shazam with my 18 year old son! Will tell you what I tought about it when we get back. But by the trailers I'm betting it will be a ton of fun! See you later fam!"
"12928","@CapShower Yeah gramps whatever you say if it makes you feel better abt yourself. Now go away I have to go see Shazam with my son."
"12929","@Honey_Heidi360 @mellymovies @cineworld I think there was one girl in dumbo with flashing head bobbles.  Also had a baby in Shazam"
"12930","@AdamWolpert1 Interested in seeing the results. Shazam was my first DC movie"
"12931","Regardless of how you feel about the cameo in Shazam. Don’t ruin it for people by sharing the photo everywhere. #Shazam"
"12932","(Just to be clear, I enjoyed the movie. But...still.) #Shazam"
"12933","@Foenix Yep! Just a little late to the #Shazam party."
"12934","@dkMOMUS as i understand it there are two things at play -- 1) licensing or something whereby one company(?) had rights(?) to Capt. Marvel but called him Shazam, and 2) one of these companies making Captain Marvel into a woman in this movie that is coming out (is out?)"
"12935","@HackinTimSeeley Shazam was a lovely film. The creatives on the film understood the essence of the concept and translated it well."
"12936","got out of work and got ramen, went to prospect park, read on a bench for a while and now seeing shazam &amp; pet sematary back to back, wow!! what a big day!!"
"12937","@Danburden1138 last December up against The Last Jedi? If you look at the film calendar now it's really difficult to release a film in a prime spot without any competition. Even Disney is struggling - hence releasing Dumbo a week before Shazam, so killing off the 2nd weekend."
"12938","@NinjaArtWork When I went to go watch #Shazam homegirl that was sitting next to me was #asleep through the whole movie lmao <U+0001F4AF><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"12939","Now if I can make it to the theater to see Shazam &amp; Pet Sematary before EndGame I’ll be good to go."
"12940","@LordOfCheddar If i replace you as the #1 Shazam fan you need to give us the mcdonalds sauce video"
"12941","went to the movies today 50% to see shazam 50% to sit in the exact seat i'll be in for endgame so i could plan my escape route"
"12942","i’m going to try this again so don’t let me flop this time: rt/like to be added to a shazam groupchat
-must have seen the movie bc it won’t be spoiler free
-don’t have to be mutuals but have dms open
-IF this flops again i’ll die"
"12943","Hi. Shazam is the best DC movie I have seen. Please go see it."
"12944","I hope in a sequel Billy gets to fight alongside Superman. The team up we all need!"
"12945","@newsflxsh @Partizan_Niksic @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Lmao thats just silly

I'll just wait till she makes a post about justice l3ague Snyder cut to ask her."
"12946","@FloTownYaller @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Lol what why?

We just found out it exists."
"12947","I wanted to see the new @StephenKing adaptation #PetSematary after that INCREDIBLE TEASER that was dropped a few months ago!

But the reviews have been SOO BAAAAD! Is it worth it? <U+0001F610>

I'm gonna watch that super-hero movie #Shazam instead. <U+0001F612>"
"12948","Oh, Gee, I HOPE —I really, really HOPE— that this #Shazam movie is as good as everybody is raving about! <U+0001F644><U+0001F612>

Otherwise, I'm gonna be very ANGRY for waisting my money on overhyped movies... AGAIN! <U+0001F621><U+0001F624>"
"12949","Anyway, I keep my #hopesup.

#PetSematary is OUT <U+0001F44E> and #Shazam is IN. <U+0001F44D>

Hope I've made the right decision! <U+0001F91E><U+0001F91E>"
"12950","#ShazamMovie one of the best superhero movies ever!!!!!"
"12951","@ShazamMovie This and Aquaman should be the new direction for DC. Amazing!!"
"12952","Highly recommend this movie! Funny, family friendly and has a great heart. No political crap either!"
"12953","Shazam! <U+0001F389><U+0001F941><U+0001F3B6>

Great day of ministry with the remarkable Faith Alliance Church team for the Women’s Breakaway Conference. 

We welcomed new sisters in the Lord and 92 sisters rededicated their life to Jesus. 

Allelujah!"
"12954","I'll be on more later cause I'm about to go see Shazam with family."
"12955","#Shazam was a super fun movie! Loved everything about it! Great seeing some parts of #Toronto in it. #Shazammovie #amustsee"
"12956","@Peter_Hircock @mellymovies @cineworld Why would you take a baby to a film like Shazam? I mean that's why they have kids films ...movies for juniors! Or you could take them to animation films. I can't see any baby enjoying a loud action film! Not even a light-hearted comedy one like Shazam"
"12957","@superrino12 True. Kid version billy was acting very simple &amp; mature but when he transforms into shazam, its like a big idiot comes out."
"12958","@Ortiz_IX To me any dc film that warner choppers make from november 2017 onwards, even if they claim its serious or rated R, is a wait &amp; see or watch online thing for me, just like how i did with shazam. I rather give disney/sony my $$. I may peep BOP tho."
"12959","Probably will see Shazam later"
"12960","I hope they bring us the Shazam family traveling within the 7 realms in future movies #Shazam now that we have Mr Mind in the mix. The future is bright."
"12961","shazam was cool but they are cowards for NOT making any moves at all to show how a person with a disability can simultaneously be a superhero, k bye"
"12962","Shazam snapped. I was surprised that Meagan Good was in the movie. <U+0001F440>"
"12963","@QuantumCaza @ShazamMovie @DCComics @ODEONCinemas What! This is so sad bro. Why didn't you report it to police!"
"12964","Fantastic movie all around.  Toronto was represented well!!! Looking forward to the next one!!!!"
"12965","Shazam was actually pretty good. Its easily one of the better DC movies (not that hard to do but still)"
"12966","@ObsidianPal Thanks!<U+0001F917> Super happy people found joy in Shazam!"
"12967","On Thursday, we going to go the Shazam<U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"12968","Last night i saw Shazam and there was a little boy in the row behind me had some fantastic comments through the movie, here are some of them"
"12969","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover You and Mark Strong are bald brothers now."
"12970","Just saw #Shazam laughed ourselves silly. Definitely refreshing, light and fun."
"12971","Just saw #Shazam ! @ZacharyLevi and the whole cast freaking killed it!!!"
"12972","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover I agree with ALL of this. <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"12973","@DanielDunston @Nerds4Normal The stakes feel so real in this movie and setup Civil War So well.  It also illustrates how Marvel plays Chess and DC plays checkers movie wise-although Shazam was a nice step forward."
"12974","AND ANOTHER THING

@Twitter @TheDCUniverse how come #Shazam didn't get an emoji? Not cool, guys. <U+26A1>just doesn't cut it."
"12975","the kid reminds me so much of cara. I thought it's her when I scrolled fast"
"12976","@chrisdashrob @ShazamMovie @Doaly There's this shot that is literally exactly the same composition as his Batman V Superman poster. Same studio, can't be a coincidence"
"12977","going to see shazam, the movie adaptation of the popular song-identifying app"
"12978","I'm going to say it flat out. Shazam is now in my top three favorite superhero movies of all time. Maybe even number two just before The Avengers. And I actually want to go on a little tangent, as to why."
"12979","Shazam opts for small scope setting, and action sequences that aren't really all that bombastic, in favor of profoundly endearing characterization and fully realized internal and external conflicts in the main character, Billy."
"12980","@BrothersInLight Great review, for me I couldn't see Shazam portrayed any other way than this film.  Sandberg mixed up everything perfectly with humor being at the forefront as Shazam should be done in the DCEU.  Looking forward to the sequel."
"12981","Seeing #Shazam and there was no special #Godzilla trailer. I feel robbed."
"12982","Guys I just saw Shazam and it was frickin amazing you should see it it’s the best dc movie ever created just don’t set next to little kids who won’t shut up"
"12983","BTS as the villains in the next shazam movie"
"12984","okg there’s 7 in the shazam fam and 7 in bts it cancels out"
"12985","Saw #Shazam ...I liked it. I wouldn’t say it’s as funny as some of these critics are saying but I definitely enjoyed the movie. I would recommend it."
"12986","Never liked reading Shazam, was just too corny for me, but the movie  was far better than I expected"
"12987","Shazam, Green Arrow, Aquaman, just didn’t find any of those books spectacular. I have to say Mike Grell’s and Kevin Smith’s runs of Green Arrow are  terrific"
"12988","@ZacharyLevi I went to see @ShazamMovie today and I wanted to let you know how much I loved it! Such a feel good movie which made me laugh and cry. I already want to get my ass to see it again and I’m super proud of you man, well done <U+0001F970>"
"12989","@ZacharyLevi so I went to see @ShazamMovie today and I wanted to let you know how much I loved it. Such a feel good movie which made me laugh and cry. I already want to get my ass to see it again because it was insane! You should be proud of yourself man <U+0001F970>"
"12990","My favorite part of SHAZAM! is who they set up in the sequel because the DCMU of 5 yrs ago wouldn't have touched that character with a 50 foot pole."
"12991","Imagine constantly using this headline to get algorithms to bring up your Shazam articles"
"12992","#Shazam is a brilliant DC film, lighthearted and fun. Knows the type of cheesy comic book film it wants to be whilst also having a strong heart and emotional core. Well worth the watch, <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>/5"
"12993","#Shazam might be the best DC film since the Dark Knight. Man it was so good. @ZacharyLevi was insanely good."
"12994","#SHAZAM was so good. Funny, great action, oh and hilarious. @ZacharyLevi proved he was born for this role."
"12995","going to see shazam tonight, have any of u guys seen it?"
"12996","I hope this will be a lesson to Hollywood to not shove white male leads down our throats. Forced homogeneity is a losing strategy. Go based, go bankrupt"
"12997","@RealJohnGlover @michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi You made our lives.  &lt;3"
"12998","Really sad to see my fellow Snyder fans spoil #Shazam for others because WB won't release a cut.
Zack would be extremely dissapointed in you and he would never condone this toxic behavior"
"12999","Shazam movie is a bit longer than it should’ve been. Decent fun film to watch though. Zachary Levi. <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"13000","This is untrue. They have the fast one and the slow one."
"13001","My hot take of the day: The allure of Godzilla was that it was obviously a person in a suit. We loved Godzilla because of it, not in spite of it. And we all wanted to grow up to be that person. Realistic Godzilla is just a dragon, and dragons are boring."
"13002","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie This makes me so happy"
"13003","Saw @ShazamMovie today with my son and it was great! @ZacharyLevi is the perfect super hero!!"
"13004","(4/4) &amp; lighthearted &amp; his performance so full of joy that it nearly made me teary-eyed to see him up there on the big screen, leading a superhero movie and flying around. In short, Zach was born to play this role. Get out there and see it! #shazam #shazammovie #shazam<U+26A1> Shazam"
"13005","So what you guys think!? Was #shazam a box office win or whimper?"
"13006","@Planet__G @Only_Grey I don't think it's bland. It's just not something you like. Escapism is just as important as realism in cinema. Having one doesn't mean there's no room for the other. Neither does escapism remove real world consequences. Shazam proved that."
"13007","I haven’t listened yet, but I know the guy behind this and he’s a pretty well versed gent in all things nerd. <U+0001F913>"
"13008","DC definitely followed the Marvel template with Shazam but it works! Easily their best film since The Dark Knight Rises."
"13009","Shazam should have adapted the “The Power of Shazam” story."
"13010","“shazam” was actually very good. DC, I applaud you, everyone go see shazam in theater’s and show it some love!"
"13011","@Ken_DeMange Missing Link was excellent - my favourite film of 2019 to date. Properly laughed out loud on my own and had a little cry towards the end as well. Shazam was just OK. About 20 mins too long and I wanted to punch the living shit out of the little sister."
"13012","Never thought Batson and Diana would be carrying the DCU. Best DC film I’ve seen in abouuuut a decade. #Shazam"
"13013","Just got back from Shazam! and I really liked it! It's super fun, takes itself seriously when it has too, has some interesting themes. Third act is a bit overstuffed imho, but doesn't detract from the themes like Wonder Woman did. Would recommend!"
"13014","@retort_the There is a cameo appearance of superman but that’s all in that movie. But I think #Shazam will be a member of justice league"
"13015","I watched #Shazam twice and #CaptainMarvel not. My sons said CPt Marvel was “ok” but are enthusiastic with Shazam! Thank you #DC for still making great movies and stories!"
"13016","Shazam was definitely the most fun DCEU movie for me. Give this one a shot, even if you're not a fan DC's previous work."
"13017","Shazam may be the most touching superhero movie. Or perhaps I'm just particularly susceptible to crying today"
"13018","fuck now there's a solid month before we get this issue... eh, gives me time to go see the movie again"
"13019","@RealJohnGlover Back in the DCU where you belong - thank you for making Shazam! even more of a treat."
"13020","“In theater averages, “High Life” came out on top this week. The film made an average of $25K per location on its debut weekend. In comparison, “Shazam!” landed in second-place“ TALENTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"13021","tell me how my little sister told our lyft driver and the people next to us in the theater that we’re only seeing shazam because “her sister loves jack grazer” <U+0001F480><U+0001F62D>"
"13022","Is there a Gomer Pile reference in Shazam."
"13023","Just saw Shazam! I absolutely loved it!<U+26A1><U+0001F44D>"
"13024","@smilingldsgirl Luckily, with a $100 million budget (modest by superhero movie standards), Shazam doesn't need to pull in gargantuan numbers to turn a profit."
"13025","Yeah my recommendation go see Shazam instead of Pet Sematary."
"13026","@Josh2Gud4U @rightbackatya4 People are actually spoling Shazam for others because they’re upset after the snyder cut? Yikes."
"13027","@Charlies_London @KevinGregorioTF @EthanVanSciver That’s very true. The super speed effects in Shazam were also pretty bad. They need to spend more time on the visuals and improve their editing a lot."
"13028","@Movieym Yeah, I heard some mixed reviews about Aquaman. It does look gorgeously done though. Excited for this new direction. I haven't left a theater as happy as I did in a while after seeing Shazam."
"13029","@samueljbernal Yes but Shazam is a comic about the whole family. It starts off by introducing Billy and then once the whole family gets the powers it becomes a team comic. I’m pretty sure the sequel is going to do the same now that they all have their powers"
"13030","omg can these movie bitxhes just watch a movie and go im gonna go into shazam and get my whole fucking life and exit feeling happy do you all experience that? huh? do you ever let yourself just enjoy a movie?"
"13031","@nmundy @SmallHandStu Yeah I've heard of them, and this cinema also does child friendly screenings but SHAZAM is a 12A so? It cried a bit, can't be nice for them either being so loud"
"13032","I didn't mind other Snyder fans shit on the DCEU daily, bc that's their business, they are grown adults. But when you called others who likes Aquaman or Shazam, imbeciles, or spoiled the movie for them, That's cheap. You are in your right to not like these above,"
"13033","Jack Dylan Grazer (Freedy in Shazam) is such a great actor and smart af."
"13034","@gryphoenix1 shazam really flew so low many even forgot it exists"
"13035","Gotta love @TheRock taking credit for #Shazam being number one. Didn’t hear a word of promotion from you for the movie. “A producer” on the move, biiiiiiiiitch who u lie to? And also not a mention of mania.  We all know a movie isn’t #1 till it is in China <U+0001F60F>"
"13036","$158.6 million globally on it's opening weekend!! That's nuts but @ShazamMovie deserves that @ZacharyLevi put soul in this movie what performance #Shazam"
"13037","With some Original #Marvel superhero retiring after #AvengersEndgame and the way #DCEU building with back to back super hit I think future looks amazing for Comic Inspired movies #Shazam"
"13038","Just saw #Shazam &amp; just amazing, @ZacharyLevi you're brilliant. Potryal of superhero was classic, kept it clean and light hearted. #DCEU finally getting it"
"13039","Uploading my #shazam spoiler free review... Guys I look amazing on the facetime camera and ONLY the facetime camera. The struggle is real. Video coming in a bit it was so good!"
"13040","For those parents who took their 8-year old kids to see @ShazamMovie and then complained that it was too scary for them and had to leave. It's PG-13, of course it might be too much for them. Don't blame the filmmakers, it's your fault for not doing the research on the ratings!"
"13041","For those parents who took their 8-year old kids to see @ShazamMovie and then complained that it was too scary for them and had to leave. It's PG-13, of course it might be too much for them. Don't blame the filmmakers, it's yours for not doing the research on the ratings!"
"13042","Roosters and a movie with Ted and Emma.  They watched Shazam!  I watched Unplanned.  Sad movie."
"13043","Just saw Shazam! 90% of its charm was stolen straight out of Spider-Man: Homecoming and wasn’t executed nearly as well, but the movie is still a solid A. Go see it! Or if you don’t want to pay $4 for a movie ticket, then just watch Brie Larson’s Unicore Store on Netflix."
"13044","is that percy jackson?"
"13045","But the movie is AMAZING! Another win for DC!"
"13046","@RuhRoweRarin Nah it was never gonna be close in my eyes. A female lead movie that’s leading directly into Endgame is a license to print money. Shazam will be still be financially and critically successful"
"13047","@GetBizzyChrizzy People are saying the 5 minutes of footage they show before Shazam is incredible. They didn’t show it before mine <U+0001F62A>"
"13048","I really enjoyed it."
"13049","Honestly shocked that Shazam didn't come closer to Captain Marvel's opening weekend numbers. I think a lot of that is consumers faith in Marvel Studios as opposed to still being a bit gun shy on DC. Regarding lesser known characters that is."
"13050","Retracting what I originally said about Shazam bc I’ve been thinking about it more and more and I’m starting to find I really like it more and more"
"13051","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Hopefully; DC finally gets it right with Shazam. I just watched Aquaman; another bad DC movie."
"13052","@Certinfy Kids and I had a blast! We have been yelling Shazam since yesterday!"
"13053","@ashchanchlani @ponysmasher Well they are the marvels greatest competitor's and well if you compare @Marvel with @DCComics it is also a great universe for movies like #thedarkknight and @SuicideSquadWB, @aquamanmovie and @ShazamMovie is in the list don't you think so.Well I am a diehard fan of @Marvel"
"13054","@markhughesfilms @ShazamMovie @Forbes Excellent summary, as usual. Thanks for these details, Mark."
"13055","No, I Should Be Thanking You Guys. 
I saw #SHAZAM yesterday and if I had not known about the ""Headless Superman Cameo"" pic in advance. I would probably have a Nervous Breakdown in the theatre."
"13056","@DCComics @ShazamMovie ""Delightfully playful""?!!! That boardroom multiple murder, fratracide, monster massacre wasn't exactly ""playful.""
Walked out of the cinema with my kids at that point. Needlessly graphic scene. Trailer and tags like this are massively misleading. Aimed at kids, but not for kids."
"13057","To be fair, after not being impressed with the beginning of our first time experience at the new @CineplexParkRoyal the movie @Shazam made up for it and so did the theatre experience. Going to be hard to go any where else for the blockbusters!"
"13058","@EricDJuly I’m not even a huge captain marvel fan I’m just disagreeing on your previous assessment of her relationship with Supergirl and the Shazam family"
"13059","<U+0001F44D>  It exceeded all of my exceptions.  SHAZAM: The real Captain Marvel was totally awesome.  <U+0001F60E>"
"13060","The teeth completely breaks the aesthetic."
"13061","@Signs2323 @wbpictures I think your thoughts are the most logical way what WB will do next unfortunately. It's really a shame and disrespectful what happened with Superman in Shazam. Cavill loves to portray Superman and WB thanked him with spitting in his face to show a headless cameo it's disgusting."
"13062","@Signs2323 Shazam's box-office is struggling at the moment WB should make two things to fix this fiasco. First of make a new contract with Henry Cavill and the more importantly #ReleaseTheSndyerCut @wbpictures problems solved !"
"13063","Anticipated for Shazam and Endgame both are in the same month? it's like sophies choice lol"
"13064","@Cristian0esque @getFANDOM @BoxOffice Judging by that, Shazam will make more on the average of Ant man which is a success but Warner Bros should never do an ad campaign like this ever again. And they should do more then 2 trailers next time and do only 1 early release."
"13065","@ZacharyLevi My daughter and I saw Shazam today, it was (bleeping) awesome.<U+0001F600>"
"13066","Alyssa and I saws Shazam today, great movie, definitely recommend."
"13067","Saw #Shazam today and I really enjoyed it. It has a great cast, some funny moments and great action. It's a blast!"
"13068","Last day of vacation, but kicking off a pretty epic week. Seeing #PetSematary now. Recording an ep of @FilmGuff tomorrow. @Dumbo (with my son) then @BestEnemiesFilm Tuesday. @ShazamMovie wens and @HellboyMovie on Thursday. Thanks to @AMCTheatres and A-List/$5 Tuesdays! #Guffians"
"13069","So Shazam was fucking great. don't be fooled by the trailers if u think it's all light and suitable for really young kids. As I learnt...."
"13070","Shazam! is likely the best pure superhero movie I've ever seen. Take your kids. #philly #BigRedCheese @ShazamMovie"
"13071","@worldofmera @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Lol. You actually think wb have the guts to do such stories. No darlings. Its only 
Cheesy corny now."
"13072","@QuanFlix_ Game of Thrones? Shazam?"
"13073","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Wonder Woman's seal of approval is worth its weight in gold, adamantium, diamonds, and vibranium. <U+0001F60A>"
"13074","The [spoiler] in Shazam! makes it automatically the best [spoiler] movie this side of the millenium."
"13075","@ponysmasher just saw Shazam;I like the fact that you understood the billybatson-Shazam character though I think you rushed the introduction of him getting his powers. I also would’ve loved if a glimpse of Black Adam portrayed when the wizard was referring to his mistake of (1/2)"
"13076","When the wizard was referring to his mistake of picking the wrong champion. But then again you did a great job. @ZacharyLevi you owned the character, I felt like you been reading a lot on Shazam. I hope the sequel is a bit longer with a bit more action."
"13077","Shazam is an amazing movie. So many surprises i loved it. Must see!!! #Shazam"
"13078","Can y’all hop off of Zachary Levi’s dick? Y’all bring this up and call him a racist/sexist right around the time his movie is doing great? Half of the mcu actors have said and done racist/sexist things, but ZL talking about it is problematic? Don’t bring that bs here #shazam"
"13079","Hey, @geoffjohns and @DCComics: I know you have an explanation of #SHAZAM and his name, but have you considered ""Captain Champion"" for a day-to-day name? Alliterative, respectful of his creator, C.C. Beck, and exactly what a child would come up with."
"13080","@ZacharyLevi Just saw the @ShazamMovie with @ipacker0509 .  Loved it!!! <U+0001F923><U+0001F604><U+0001F61C>"
"13081","@brielarson @captainmarvel Men and Women are equal so it’s ok to give the guy heros a turn <U+0001F601> @MarvelStudios"
"13082","Congratulations on being #1 <U+0001F389>@ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @TheRock @DCComics"
"13083","Shazam was great. Funny and the action was great. Want to watch it again!"
"13084","Saw Shazam! aka Captain Marvel (long story there) and I liked it. Well most of it I got disinterested in it somewhere in middle. However, the final act was super good!"
"13085","@Complex I should of seen Shazam instead of pet sematary <U+0001F494>that movie wasn't scary &amp; it was average at best"
"13086","HOLY MOLY this movie was AMAZING! It’s already my all-time favorite DC movie. Heartwarming, hilarious, full of action and a ton of DC nods and references. I encourage you all to see it ASAP!"
"13087","I wanna try to hit replies on the other 2 accounts by the coming hour mark because I’ll be out later to have dinner and see Shazam with a friend. I’ll be doing an hour on each so you know where I’ll be at!"
"13088","I really wanted to like #Shazam , but the disability representation on a script level was just distractingly awful."
"13089","Kids and I enjoyed .@ShazamMovie way more than Captain Marvel (snooze). Loved the ending in #Shazam too!"
"13090","I swear, Shazam is still the most underrated app. definitely doesn’t get the love it deserves"
"13091","@ShazamMovie I thought it was okay.. saw it last night. Little too cheesy for my taste in an action movie but lots of comedic elements to it too. Was worth the watch tho"
"13092","I love Zachary so much omg, he even plays Arcade Gannon in Fallout new Vegas (my favourite companion in my favourite game) and here he is, blowing me away with another role! 

He probably won’t see this tweet but I can only dream! #shazam"
"13093","Seriously folks don’t let anybody spoil #Shazam for you. There’s an angle in this film that is entirely left out of all the trailers, kudos to Warner Brothers."
"13094","@ponysmasher any chance of #SHAZAM having the IMAX cut on blu-ray?"
"13095","@aDreamofHome hope you haven’t gotten hit with spoilers. Aquaman was awesome and theater-worthy for its visuals but the story didn’t have many twists, but Shazam! has a couple surprising things that should be really cool for anyone unfamiliar with the character’s origins"
"13096","// i just got home from watching Shazam! at the cinema and it was absolutely amazing omg"
"13097","That Shazam is one of the worst movies I've seen. DC need to give up. Also getting the rock to help produce it was just adding to how shit it was going to be <U+0001F602> watching Thor to get over how bad it was. #marveltilidie"
"13098","@ComicsinMotionP @DCComics @_DCWorld @ZacharyLevi @Jasper_Reviews @jdimaria124 @GeekVibesNation Shazam! Release was pushed back because of Aquaman release"
"13099","@vinaldo7 it also very easy to think about others. You all could just tweet ""hey i have a scene from shazam anyone who wants to see it and talk about it, like this tweet and we make a group chat"""
"13100","@therealeverton @17thomascrown @ScottMendelson @Forbes Family friendly films are just not popular in China at all.Most audience are young adults, Shazam is too childish for them.Good Story/Charming Characters/CGI/gay ships(non-canon),at least provide one of them.Due to cultural differences and low budgets,Shazam doesn’t have any."
"13101","@mellymovies @cineworld I went to see Shazam for a 2nd time yesterday  and there was a family brought their 3 year old and I thought myself oh god she will get sceard at the monsters scene and I was right."
"13102","Marvel and DC PETTYYYY"
"13103","I'm going to Shazam on Tuesday before work, you tryna go?"
"13104","Thought Shazam was basically Big crossed with Superman &amp; I really liked it's tone and pacing. The suit actually worked too which helped alot!!"
"13105","@ZacharyLevi over 50 million and the final #’s aren’t even in! Amazing to the job to the whole cast of #shazam"
"13106","@clungegoblin I had 3 people text me this who all went and saw shazam together. I told them about the big zilla trailer. But they still innocently rub it in my face. Pain"
"13107","@thwipstick I want a superman movie in the new Shazam version of the universe.

You know, hopeful

* spoiler sorry"
"13110","@AsherAngel Just saw Shazam! I loved it so much. I highly recommend to everyone of all ages! :) <U+0001F49C>"
"13111","istg if they showed ***** ****** at the end of shazam! i would have rated it 4/4,5 stars"
"13112","I went in thinking Shazam was not going to be good and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was it good, it was a better origin film, as far as heart and action, than Captain Marvel. For me, it wasn’t better than Aquaman, but still great."
"13113","Well they better hurry it up, because Black Adam in a Shazam movie and those kids aren't gonna be kids forever."
"13114","@fincherism @LunarArchivist Shazam shows that super hero flicks can be fun and silly and still have heart. :)"
"13115","|| Replies later. Going to see Shazam!"
"13116","There’s way more in the actual review so feel free to read it if you like"
"13117","Just left, and #SHAZAM was great! Easily the best superhero flick so far this year. Gimme more of this!"
"13118","About to watch Shazam... Super excited... Heard great things about this movie..."
"13119","I need to go see Shazam at the theater jsksjsksks i been waiting months for this movie"
"13120","Controversial opinion: Shazam is the best DC movie to come out"
"13121","it’s amazing how this kid has such a respectful and wise answer meanwhile adults in this website get a temper tantrum when DC has a successful movie lmao"
"13122","it’s amazing how this kid has such a respectful and wise answer meanwhile adults on this website get a temper tantrum when DC has a successful movie lmao"
"13123","Shazam was amazing! Everything I love in a superhero movie (funny, heartbreaking, good origin story) plus a super hot villain. Bless you for your ability to play evil, Mark Strong."
"13124","Is Shazam a good movie ? Asking so I can go see it later <U+0001F9D0>"
"13125","My parents' friend: Yo quiero ver #Shazam!
Me: *materializes out of thin air*"
"13126","@its_johnc It is kind of a comedy, but I feel like that was always going to be the obvious route for the film adaption. There are legit moments of mild horror tho, everything venom was meant to do is done in shazam lol. I preferred Shazam to Cap Marvel. Let me know what you think"
"13127","With Aquaman and now Shazam, I think @TheDCUniverse has finally exited the dark times....a.k.a the Snyderverse. @ShazamMovie is really good!"
"13128","solid superhero origin with a lot of heart at the center of it. starts off kind of slow, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole ride. also love how close it is to the new 52 comic run. Zachary Levi as Shazam is great"
"13129","Y'all, I just saw SHAZAM and I'm love??? Oh my gosh????? I've been wanting to see this movie for AT LEAST a year and a half, whenever it was that images of the filming started circulating, and it did not disappoint altho that could just be me the easily impressed Fool Child."
"13130","Wow! A positive review from Your Movie Sucks <U+0001F642>"
"13131","lol YouTube starting to recommend the cutscene of Shazam's fate in Injustice 1.

Good. More people can be mad about that. Probably the shittiest thing Injustice did."

"13133","Well I just finished filming my #ShazamMovie review and there’s NO SPOILERS!!! I’m so proud of myself <U+0001F602><U+0001F605>"
"13134","Just got out of Shazam! I loved it. #SHAZAM"
"13135","The best thing about Shazam is that it no longer makes me look like some weird contrarian when I say I prefer DC to Marvel."
"13136","henry post something about shazam... we’re waiting"
"13137","@shelbiie Nope it not on my watch list, I may watch it if I really have nothing else to watch. Katy needs to see #SHAZAM so that will be watched again before Dumbo. But some good films coming out around April!! A couple walked out of the cinema when it started to heat up tonighta"
"13138","Okay so I watched Shazam!

Enjoyable. Wouldn't go to see it again. Given how much darker the other DC movies have been, I'm not show how he will fit into the bigger picture. Shazam was far more humour and comic booky."
"13139","@davemacladd They’re the Shazam of the animal kingdom."
"13140","@ZacharyLevi just wanted to congratulate you on the superb job done in #Shazam. What an absolute treat. Very well worth the wait! #Epic #fantastic #great #welldone"
"13141","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Finally a Gal Godot post...<U+0001F64F><U+0001F64F> Hail to the queen..."
"13142","Everyones comments on Shazam has been getting me so excited. Is it really that good?

Disappointed I might not get to watch it at the cinema."
"13143","If you haven’t seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for?"
"13144","Movies tonight is the move #Shazam"
"13145","@CritRoleFaces @matthewmercer I had a dream that this happened once and I played a ranger named Shazam. So obviously that’s what I’d do."
"13146","@jonathanhealy @ShazamMovie Guess they just want to get a good run at it."
"13147","@Hanxx That's it, not watching the movie then. :D I really don't wanna think of Shazam when I'm watching Tangled. <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"13148","@neilofski @1moreGaryFrank @geoffjohns Well, Johns was quite involved in the film. This is New 52 Shazam all the way and it’s fantastic."
"13149","@waywardcalvert the original name of shazam was captain marvel, hence the debate about carol “stealing” his name"
"13150","The marketing for @ShazamMovie is so fucking bad that I don’t care if the movie is any good. It can wait until it’s free on Netflix. I don’t wanna look at his overacted surprised derp face on the big screen."
"13151","Some say #Shazam wasn't edgy enough for 'em? Perhaps the #DCEU writers should take after their dctv cousins &amp; go to tumblr for ideas on which super important character to axe off. After all dc comics should always listen to those fans instead of doing their own thing... right?"
"13152","Shazam pulled from the New 52 but was so true to the spirit of classic Captain Marvel that I can’t blame them. A fun movie full of heart. Strong recommendation."
"13153","How did I miss this when I watched this movie? LOVE this! That man sure was fine when he “SHAZAMED”."
"13154","#Shazam was fun, had a lot of the problems that many marvel origins do, and a couple of my pet peeves, but overall In terms of a course correction it was good. I loved the unexpected villain that showed up in the post credits and hope we see more from him, overall maybe 7/10"
"13155","I really hope Shazam beats Josstice at BO."
"13156","shazam is just as amazing the second time <U+0001F970>"
"13157","people who hate shazam must hate fun"
"13158","Off to see @ShazamMovie with the family for my bday and my husband keeps yelling “Shazam” randomly.@ZacharyLevi"
"13159","Continue the dc story as so much changes, I’m not able to invest, Shazam has no appeal to me, no promotion has grabbed me even though x-men had issues and continuity errors I was and still am so invested and can’t wait to see dark Phoenix as Fox’s swan song. My view is that"
"13160","Shazam was the best recent DC movie and I'd have to say it's just as good or better as a lot of marvel movies"
"13161","I really loved Shazam! Super fun and touching. So did my 8yo son."
"13162","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Looking forward to you two teaming up soon"
"13163","Glad I saw Shazam but probably built it up bc I laughed so much at the trailers. Was glad they made certain story choices and was moved by the foster care “new family” concept. Maybe 3 out of 4 stars. I’d say Wonder Woman &gt;Shazam&gt; the rest of DCU but only bc DCU isn’t great."
"13164","Asher Angel's performance as Billy Batson convinced me more and also the Shazam family were good too. And the interraction between them felt often quite genuine and real. Sivana had a good backstory, but his performance could have been also more powerful as a villain."
"13165","I didn't like that much Zachary's performance as Shazam. He was acting pretty cheesy even at some points of the film, where I expected a more mature turn of him. That's why maybe his transforming into a superhero didn't convince me that much, than what I expected."
"13166","Again, it's a thread of my opinions, but you can only make up your mind, whether you like the movie or not by watching Shazam at theaters. <U+0001F60A>"
"13167","We don't even talk about the outlook of the movie (like CGI, costumes etc.), 'cuz I know it had a low budget, so it's like......yeah idk<U+0001F914> I thought I would e.g. love the Shazam costume more in the movie, but unfortunately the feelings remained the same - negative."
"13168","Loved #Shazam - like a cross between Kickass, Spiderman and Big Hero 6.

Audience of all ages was laughing at possibly the best DC live action movie since The Dark Knight and continues this new tradition of them actually making FUN movies!"
"13169","Just got back from seeing #Shazam and it was a great movie"
"13170","@MarkKolpack @ArcLightCinemas @ShazamMovie Yes and my friend reminded me it was paired with Isis too!"
"13171","J-Critic: SHAZAM!  I love the spectacle of a superhero movie because it's so eminent, incredible, and fascinating. It takes us to new heights with invigorating lightning and mind-blowing action. This is completely enhanced with its budget. #Shazamfilm #DC #WarnerBrosPIctures"
"13172","My DCEU ranking now: 
Aquaman
Shazam
Wonder Woman
Man of Steel

Suicide Squad

that's it. that's the list."
"13173","@RuhRoweRarin As a fan of the genre, Shazam just isn't speaking to me. I'm gonna see it, and more than likely love it. idk if it's the marketing or what, but there's no spark there initially."
"13174","Sooo Shazam rekindled my excitement for DC movies <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"13175","@MarkKolpack @ArcLightCinemas @ShazamMovie I really enjoyed this movie, I wasn’t sure what to expect so it was a relief to go see a movie with no expectations and walk out impressed. I thought they did a excellent job and will see it again. #Shazam!"
"13176","some lady really just got a refund for Shazam because it was too scary wtf lmao mamadas"
"13177","Shazam! took place in the middle of December in Philadelphia and not a single character wore an Eagles beanie. 

Need my money back @DCComics @CEOAdam"
"13178","Someone brought their kids &amp; baby to the cinema to watch Shazam
Then the kids started talking and laughing unnecessarily {you know that fake laugh kids do for attention} 

Then the scary scene happened &amp; they went quiet

Then I laughed alone"
"13179","pretty excited to see Shazam tonight i've heard good things <U+0001F973>"
"13180","About to watch SHAZAM. Will have a reaction video later."
"13181","My best friend would have the ability to stop time (or at least create more of it in a day!)."
"13182","@SuperSuitShow @DCComics @UpToTASK @artbyatlas0 @MrNiceGuy18_58 @JamesGavsie @3BlackGeeks @BThanBTI @ZacharyLevi @CBNostalgia @RandyS0725 wow, that's not good. I think like a lot of people, I came outta the movie a bigger Shazam fan than I was before going in. There should be merch to buy!"
"13183","Finally saw #Shazam today and I loved it. Refreshingly fun effort from DC and I was laughing so much throughout. Plus, the cameos actually made my day <U+0001F917>"
"13184","Going to watch Shazam! With my parents like the thug I am"
"13185","Took tomorrow off got invited to the Cubs game and then they backed out at the last minute, might go see Shazam! instead"

"13188","So Fugly went to see #Shazam! today. Some funny parts, but I ended up looking forward to it being over. Critics suck tho."
"13189","Really hoping the success of @ShazamMovie and @ZacharyLevi will lead to more people discovering Chuck so we can get the other movie we so wholeheartedly want."
"13190","@AMCTheatres you guys suck ass, went to see Shazam yesterday with the kids and was promised free Shazam comic book and they wouldn’t give us any. My kids are autistic and you guys couldn’t even give them just that, smh <U+0001F44E> wackboys"
"13191","I wish I could get paid for finding music for people cause I’m really good at that, I’m like a living Shazam."
"13192","Shazam was meh. Really no need to see it. It wasn't bad but wasn't good. Most DC filler vilians have shit character design (seven sins). Had no ties to other DC movies or heroes. Fight scenes could have been more. Orphan story was touching. Didn't resolve next step"
"13193","@StreetYNWA I only ranked these in terms of enjoyment. Story wise it will be different. And I saw all of these twice except for Shazam but I really enjoyed JL both times I watched it."
"13194","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover Aww...giving props to your pops! <U+0001F60A>"
"13195","I want to see Shazam! It looks funny. But I’ll probably wait until it goes out on VHS #Shazam"
"13196","byee going to see shazam now, in the same day that asher!!! love y'all"
"13197","Shazam was good, didn’t really have expectations but DC been on a good wave lately with the movies"
"13198","@GeekVibesNation @hwatford It's brilliant ...hope everyone watches it . #Shazam"
"13199","@ponysmasher #Shazam is one of the best superhero films ever made"
"13200","Dudes in their 20s/30s still bringing up the Shazam/Captain Marvel thing are losers. Like I’m sorry, but what else can you call them? Shazam, under DC Comics specifically, has always been Shazam. It’s a stupid fight to pick anyway, because DC was super shitty to the creators."
"13201","People like to talk about how Marvel are some assholes for something that happened in the late 60s with a lawsuit that didn’t even have to do with Shazam nor the original brand. Meanwhile, DC straight up sued the creators to try and squash a competitor to their Superman comics."
"13202","I can’t wait to see @ShazamMovie again and I never thought I’d say that about a DC movie tbh <U+0001F62D> @ZacharyLevi is a NATIONAL TREASURE <U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"13203","Took my children to this and there is a scene where Shazam pulls out his erect penis and says ""woah, bigger than before."" Absolutely horrible. Hoping Joker is better"
"13204","Shazam was by far the best DC movie I’ve ever seen. Super funny and well rounded, plus Zachary Levi is always hilarious <U+0001F602>"
"13205","Ah. Do you know how good it feels to say we have the first good, no, GREAT live action DC movie since 2012? @ShazamMovie is a total blast of a film. Please go see it. It deserves every penny."
"13206","Shazam was definitely the best movie that the DCEU has ever put out. I am shocked"
"13207","You guys - @ShazamMovie was SO great. A fantastic blend of comedy and action, nice pacing so I didn't feel a lull, and casting was ideal. But of course, it wouldn't make one of my tops of the year if it didn't have a spark of heart in it to leave me in tears.<U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"13208","@chrisb895 Shazam in general is kind of goofy. After all he is really a 15 year old kid. Me and my wife and brother and his wife laughed through the whole thing"

"13211","Shazam is actually a really good movie lol"
"13212","A large portion of the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut group are massive losers

Love Zack Snyder, but not all the DC films have to have his touch, especially not Shazam. The film fit his character perfectly"
"13213","Loved @ZacharyLevi in @ShazamMovie!  Hope to see him again in future DC movies.  Would love to see him and Henry Cavill team up.  Very fun origin story and a solid addition to the DC Universe."

"13217","@Luiz_Fernando_J I'm actually curious to see how Shazam does in Japan since some of the dubbing cast is pretty well known, no? Overall its doing well besides China unfortunately, but NA seems to be picking up on the slack."

"13219","Very impressed with Shazam!!! Definitely the best movie DC has made."

"13246","It’s great to revisit 80’s films like Back To The Future and The Goonies with my kids, but with directors emerging who grew up in the same era, we’re now getting films like Shazam and Bumblebee. Films that are directly drawing on those influences, but making something new."
"13247","I really enjoyed Shazam btw it’s very good definitely check it out"
"13248","#Shazam is doing well overseas and the movie deserves it"

glad you loved it.@ScottDC27 
will see it again tomorrow, thanks for the easter egg hint, Scott

"13253","Shazam is by far the best DC movie. absolutely amazing movie"
"13254","#Shazam Was poorly written, managed to be somehow really rushed while feeling too long and very predictable. The family stuff was cheesy, the dark stuff was trying to hard and it had serious tone issues.. but it was really fun, the humour was amazing and action was great. See it!"
"13255","@Browntable_Ent Yay! By the time the Shazam vids out I’d probs have already watched it cause I’m going on Wednesday. The hentai better have tentacles tho..."
"13256","@Nullh Meh still a champion.
I did this yesterday. 

Today, I went to see Shazam! and then read email and blogs. Up and down days mate <U+0001F44D>"

"13259","Might be the funniest joke to come from an Android phone"
"13260","@ponysmasher I do support the new Shazam movie 100% but it needs to be based on the original Captain Marvel storyline from the Detectives Comics storyline with of course the Family."
"13261","@ponysmasher . I said this once to you, and I'll say it again.  More people would rather have the original Captain Marvel and not the new 52 Shazam for the movie debut but you didn't listen."
"13262","@ShazamMovie is THE BEST DCEU movie. Go see it. The credits are rolling right now and I already want to see it again. #Shazam @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel"
"13263","Just got done watching #MovieMath @GraceRandolph she talking about shazam box office why people did not like the movie from the people who saw it two weeks ago"
"13264","@RUDUMB8 @HeavyWeather97 I would think they have to with the ages of the kids get Shazam 2 out in 2021 and if this films in 2020 then that's out in 2021 so I would guess shazam vs black adam 2023"
"13265","I fuck with this."
"13266","@TheNerd_Society Tho his suit is very very ugly in Shazam"
"13267","1. My answer is Superman.

2. Why the hell did you put Catwoman on there? <U+0001F602>"
"13268","Shazam is so special man. It gave me that feeling I used to get when I was a kid and I’d watch movies like E.T and home alone. I haven’t felt as totally caught up in the pure joy and excitement of a movie since I was like 9."
"13269","~He said it would have been hard to focus on two different characters' origins on a singular script, and asked Toby to split the two movies. 
~He also said he was working on Black Adam/Shazam! for over a decade now."
"13270","@DavidAFrench Shazam is just a fun, good movie. Its not upper echelon Marvel (10+ films) and its nowhere near Nolan's Batman movies."
"13271","The perfect superhero movie for all ages."
"13272","@smilingldsgirl Next weekend I think it should have a decent hold while all three of the movies do you have something that Shazam does have like Missing Link is a family comedy and little is a comedy I don't think those are going to be enough to hurt it next weekend"
"13273","@ilabachrn , you have to go see it now <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"13274","@Wecknerd I guess it’s better to let the movies exist kind of on their own-while in the same universe-than try to force team-ups. But I would love to see Shazam interact with the other heroes. It’s always a good dynamic in the comics/cartoons."
"13275","@Wecknerd Interesting trivia...two members of the Shazam Family were supposed to be in the George Miller Justice League movie"
"13276","Shazam does exist in a fantasy world. Where a toy store is full of DC comics merch."
"13277","@ponysmasher Saw Shazam twice now. I'm completely blown away! This is my favorite DC movie by a mile since Christopher Reeve played supes in Superman II!! Thank you for such an amazing film."

"13283","need to shazam that one song jisun played"
"13284","Gonna take a stab and say the not mentioned disability Freddy has in Shazam is cerebral palsy. I’m 96.3% sure. Which if that’s the case, good for you Hollywood. You have my appreciation."
"13285","In case you needed a reminder that, in spite of his overall intelligence and general good guy-ness, Mr. French has simply terrible taste in superhero movies."
"13286","Fuming! I pay a monthly fee to go to @cineworld I wanted to watch #Shazam but all screening were an additional charge? Why when I already pay a lot for the monthly subscription? It’s a joke! I am furious."

"13298","Just got out of the theater saw #Shazam it was really fun. I don't think I've had that much fun at a modern DC movie before. I'd highly recommend seeing it."
"13299","#Shazam was pretty neat stuff. Had a lotta good laughs and personally did not expect the end.

I still hope that this genre of comedic superhero DC movies will open up the way for a Booster Gold movie x3"
"13300","@JuddWinick One of the booths at the Christmas carnival had ""Hi-Lo"" written on it and I thought it might be a nod to you since your Superman/Shazam was one of the best stories?"
"13301","Shazam! was such a fun ride, I highly recommend this movie to everyone who's a bit tired of overdramatic Superhero movies and enjoys 90th family flicks!"

"13306","@ShayneTIF I’m gonna try to see US this month if I can.

I figured SHAZAM! would be overhyped, given how low the bar the DCEU has gone."
"13307","@Little_Goji @gmkgoji Before Shazam if you go to an IMAX theater it was showing for the weeknd, idk if it still is."
"13308","Don’t let his looks fool you, this little fucker is one of the most monsteously evil forces in the entire DCU"
"13309","@GalGadot @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie AFAIK the comics have rarely if ever addressed some of the shared mythology behind both characters (Greek pantheon) - maybe a future movie can?...
Then again, that's how we got ""Martha""..."
"13310","I'm part of the Kazaam/Shazaam Mandela effect so imagine my confusion upon the release of Shazam."
"13311","There is some accidental shade being thrown here. I'm going to see Shazam tonight but my guess is these end up being the only DC titles in their ""universe"" worth a damn."
"13312","SHAZAM REVIEW: what if the new 52 comic but good"
"13313","@UpToTASK Doesn't help its wedged between Shazam! and Endgame also here in australia it's got rated hard r for intense violence and gore.

Rated R movies here don't usually succeed here with a few oddities unfortunately"
"13314","Just saw Shazam. Definitely one of the best DCEU movies. A great beginning with strong character building for all characters, unfortunately followed by a much weaker ending with some pretty glaring editing issues. Overall still an enjoyable movie."
"13315","I just saw Shazam, definetly one of the best DCEU movies. Great begining that really captured the characters and made them very interesting, unfortunatly followed by a much weaker ending and some pretty glaring edditing issues. Still a enjoyable movie."
"13316","@jorel1876 zach levi did such a good job with the character. i would love to see how his shazam interacts with aquaman or ww."

"13324","Shazam in the house BITCH"
"13325","@GraceRandolph I loved the movie, it was fun, watched the early screening but even as a hardcore DC fan I didn't go see it again when it officially opened. My budget is usually 2 cinema movies in a month and with Avengers in a few weeks I don't know about a second viewing of Shazam<U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"13326","@BobDigi69 @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie I get your excitement, but I thought it was poor taste to try and use this tweet congratulating a current film’s success, as a means to focus on the past. I don’t think WB will release it, b/c if they do, and it’s better than what we got, they’re going to eat crow."
"13327","Should I post this Shazam spoiler? I mean like...if you know about the New 52 it’s not really a spoiler but it kinda is..."
"13328","So at the end credits of Shazam one of the cast members last name is Brody"
"13329","Just saw @ShazamMovie and it was great. Prime example of what a heartwarming and enjoyable comic book film is supposed to be. The movie felt like the reason why I started reading comic books in the first place 20+ years ago. @ZacharyLevi thank you so much for being a part of that"
"13330","@ponysmasher thank you for making this brilliant film.
Tomorrow I will be posting a review of Shazam! on my blog.

"13333","@ShazamMovie takes place in Philadelphia which is awesome. Only tourist eat cheesesteaks from Geno’s"
"13334","@steven030182 @1moreGaryFrank @BittrScrptReadr But the rest of the movie didn't need to be PG 13. Plus, Shazam is not Venom. However, my point wasn't that dark is bad for kids. My point was certain scenes felt way out of touch for 80% of the movie. They felt like scenes from a different movie."
"13335","@steven030182 @1moreGaryFrank @BittrScrptReadr For me personally, I just didn't think you needed it. I couldn't tell the 7 Deadly Sins apart. I didn't think they needed to be generic demon creatures. Something that fit Shazam's tone would have worked better for me."
"13336","This is common?

Why? Neither Captain Marvel or Shazam are real! You’re fighting over fiction!"
"13337","@ZacharyLevi my family and I went to see SHAZAM last night and I’ve never seen my kids so quiet at the movie theatre                     Great movie!! We all Loved it"

  He said in a calm voice as he sat down."
"13356","@PooWithEyes We're off to the Highlands tomorrow for a wee holiday, so we'll likely pay a visit to Inverness cinema while we are there. Quite fancy seeing Pet Cemetery, Shazam or Missing Link. What about you?"
"13357","Just saw Shazam,, and honestly I really enjoyed it. The cinematics were wonderful and the end credits were actually really funny! And lemme tell ya,, I truly have a 15 yr olds sense of humor,, so I lost it"
"13358","@zandook They don't fit in the Shazam world and they don't make the gritty attempt at a cinematic universe any more palatable. They didn't save Justice league. I don't feel they help anything to be honest , they don't stand alone and they don't fix anything."
"13359","I would made billy younger. What happens when they drop the Shazam sequel in 4 years and the kid is 18? Now it’s just weird. He goes from 18 to 30?"
"13360","Where can I buy that giant #batman from the #shazam trailer <U+0001F62D> I really want one. Never have I seen one so big in any store. Ever. #batmanfangirl"
"13361","I really can't work out whether or not I want to see Shazam! 

On the one hand, I love a superhero film, and it has fairly good reviews. On the other hand, that exclamation mark is really annoying."

"13363","@mr__prolifik__ Which be shazam?"
"13364","Hey, @ZacharyLevi #Shazam is fantastic. @TheDCUniverse should take note, more films like this and they'll definitely be giving @Marvel a run for their money. I saw the movie with a packed theater. A lot of little kids were shouting, ""Shazam!"" on their way out. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"13365","@_CoffeeClub Sadly haven’t watched Shazam yet, so I’ll listen to it after"
"13366","#SHAZAM was WAY better than I thought it would be. Yes, despite the very positive word of mouth and people I trust saying it was good, I still had my doubts. That said, I enjoyed the hell of it."
"13367","When I read my first Shazam comic I immediately fell in love. In concept alone, the character is an all time great. 

Seeing @ponysmasher deliver an instant classic was more than I possibly could’ve hoped for."
"13368","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover I couldn’t get past the ultra padded look of the suit.  #Shazam was like that ultra forgettable appetizer till the killer main course comes out.  At least WB is trying"

"13378","Just watched #SHAZAM It was wonderful! My favorite part was when Philadelphians pelted him with snowballs after he saved them."
"13379","Seriously though, #SHAZAM was wonderful. Everyone should go and see it. Sincere, charming, and balances terrifying monsters with childhood adventure. It shares DNA with Donner’s Superman and 80s Spielberg."
"13380","@aspiringkrypto @ShazamMovieUK @WarnerBrosUK @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher Saw #Shazam last night with the family and we loved it!! Probably go check it out again next weekend."

"13386","about to pop a painkiller that puts me in a trance like state so shazam is gonna be super fun"
"13387","After seeing #shazamlefilm I have to say. They should have stuck with calling him Captain Marvel. You probably don’t want to be turning your powers off each time you introduce yourself. “Who are you?” “I’m Shazam... aw dang it dropped another criminal.”"
"13388","I'm surely not the only one who found #ShazamMovie to be a little bit mediocre. While sufficiently entertaining, the movie simply couldn't make up its mind between being too goofy at times and wanting to be taken really, really seriously. *Loved* the Mortal Kombat references tho!"
"13389","@letstalkaquaman I personally feel that if Shazam came out before BvS, we’d have a different outlook for DC films, with Wonder Woman and Aquaman to make it even better."
"13390","Just saw #Shazam for the second time and loved it just as much as the first. My SO was seeing it for the first time and probably loved it more than I did."
"13391","Looks like #Shazam will make around $160 million worldwide its opening weekend. Pretty good for a property that is largely unknown to the vast majority of movie goers."
"13392","@mn85054 My 16 year old daughter and her friends saw Us yesterday and they all thought it was really good. 
I think some of the DC movies have been too bleak (Not the fault of the actors) so I hope Shazam is a change of pace from that."
"13393","@mn85054 Thanks for the review. I still haven't seen Us yet, nor Shazam. So, I can probably wait till Netflix or HBO for this one. I'm still behind on first run movies."
"13394","I hope we get a #SnyderCut of Shazam where Billy Batson has to kill his family by hitting them with a lightning bolt. Doesn't that sound like a great movie?"
"13395","#Shazam was good! Legitimately funny throughout. Definitely was trying too hard in some places with the ""quirky"" characters. It feels like a movie specifically aimed towards kids, with more adult elements just kind of shoved into it? Liked it a lot overall, just some weird tone."
"13396","@iNabberTV <U+0001F49C> gonna have 2 spoil shazam for myself just 2 listen 2 this (will do it anyway)"
"13397","@MarkKolpack @ArcLightCinemas @ShazamMovie It's not the worst movie of the DCEU, but I wouldn't call it great though. It is nowhere near great."
"13398","@KingofQueens13 Both are good movies and funny, Shazam is more silly funny though."
"13399","Tamking about collaboration will never forget how we discovered the nicki one through shazam and we were like ""noooo way"" but big hit this bitch was like ""yes."" One hour before the actual comeback"
"13400","Since I last watched this, I have seen Infinity War do this idea a million times better and Shazam prove that a DCEU can work. Looking at this now just makes it come across as even worse"
"13401","I’m watching Shazam and all the lights go off. Coincidence I think not"

"13410","@SuperSuitShow But they gotta make Black Adam their version of Black Panther in tone as well as setting. As Shazam’s Reverse-Flash, the studio needs to show their contrast early on."
"13411","@SuperSuitShow Yeah and his main conflict with Shazam is that kids don’t understand what great responsibility costs"
"13412","@NewJeffCT For a cheap matinee it’s fine. I have no desire to see Shazam. Looks dumb. Us though, I’ll see this week."
"13413","""Shazam!"" is another really good DC film. A strong villain, really great dynamic between Billy and his foster family that also feeds beautifully into the film's exploration of foster families, good humour, basic filmmaking competence, with some nicely composed shots (sic!) 1/2"
"13414","@ShazamMovie I loved it. A spectacular job by the cast, top to bottom. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"

Oh the irony"
"13416","@SA_Drafthouse Shout out to the Westlake location . Remodel is amazing! Adam one of the servers for Shazam was out of this world &amp; the burger was on point! I. Any wait for my am showing of Endgame in a couple weeks. #SelfCareSunday #momadventure"

"13419","basically 90% of superheroes"
"13420","I saw three movies this weekend: Us, Shazam, and Pet Sematary.  PS was disappointing, but not horrible. And who takes their kids to see Pet Sematary?"
"13421","Just got out of Shazam. I thought it was fantastic! There's a few things that could've been improved on, like the visual effects, but overall I thought the movie was super good, really funny and heartwarming. 

Go see it please."
"13422","@justsomeguycc Agree. It was great, fun and put feminist Captain Marvel to shame. Billy had growth and changed throughout the move. Carol just boasted how good she was. Billy got his ass kicked and learned lessons. #CaptainMarvel #Shazam"

@Marvel. Thanks for taking his title so now he’s called Shazam. He should be Captain Marvel. Doh. #shazam"

I’M ALREADY EXCITED I DON’T NEED REMINDING"

"13432","Have I mentioned how much I’ve enjoyed Shazam? <U+0001F60D>"
"13433","@MrKenShabby Needed something proving his heroism, maybe in midpoint of movie. And why is the streetwise orphan kid who can hack a police laptop and operate independently, suddenly behaving like Homer Simpson on steroids as ‘Shazam’? Gave more of a superhero feel than ‘Man of steel’ though!"
"13434","didn't see that coming from SHAZAM <U+0001F602>"
"13435","@mistwhisper117 @GraceRandolph Shazam is a great movie.  Go see it."

"13438","Damian and I went to go watch Shazam. It was not bad, definitely a lot of comedy. All I got to say is Megan Good <U+0001F60D>"
"13439","Can somebody go see Shazam with me? What if I'm treating?"
"13440","@MrKenShabby Liked it but, throughout, Shazam acts like an adult acting like a kid but the kid acts like a kid acting like an adult. Why aren’t they the same if they are the same person?"
"13441","About to see Shazam! in 40 minutes excited"
"13442","@AwesomEmergency After seeing Shazam, I'd rather he just played a proper villain"
"13443","@ZacharyLevi you and the team in Shazam! were amazing. It is the best movie in the DC franchise. Also, the best movie I have seen this year. Everyone check it out! #ShazamMovie"
"13444","Off to see #Shazam!"
"13445","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie I wish you could have been the one to join Freddie and his family at the school lunch table. Maybe next time."

"13448","wait I just realized that the DC intro didn't play in front of Shazam"
"13449","I also watched #Shazam today and how the fuck is this the best DC movie? Really enjoyable to watch. Good script, good comedy! More of that please"
"13450","#3 is understated.   I would place the M. Night Shyamalan trilogy as 2nd tier."
"13451","Thoroughly impressed by Shazam. Not as good as Aquaman but definitely a solid movie."
"13452","Wow!!! I’ve been a DC Comics fan since the 70’s and @ShazamMovie was amazing!!! It definitely wasn’t what I expected. My kids loved it and wifey wants to see it again. I will definitely be adding #Shazam to my collection."

"13454","Shazam surpassed my expectations by a country mile. Well done @ponysmasher"
"13455","I hope shazam good. It sounds interesting"
"13456","@CinemaScore @ShazamMovie It should get an F for screwing up some of most basic parts of the character"
"13457","ok i think it’s kinda unfair for dc to not put any of the scary/dark stuff in shazam’s trailer. i went into it thinking it was a lighthearted comedy and parents are bringing children to it when it’s low key a horror movie (still amazing tho don’t get me wrong)"
"13458","Excellent review of Shazam.  
Such a fun and thoughtful movie in several levels. 

wtg @DCComics !!"
"13459","@robjhump Nope... at the movies now tho... seeing Shazam"
"13460","@AdamWolpert1 I haven't seen Aquaman or Shazam yet so maybe I'm behind the times on this

but the way I see it is that the DCEU is visually way cooler than marvel movies, but don't really have any depth, marvel movies for the most part all look fairly same, and have good stories and characters"
"13461","@Briefslayer Second movie of the day. Went to Shazam before"
"13462","Finally seeing @UsMovie today after checking out @ShazamMovie last night!  Shazam was fun/cute movie! Perfect for kids with some 90’s pop culture references for the adults."
"13463","@KingMaciass Went and saw Shazam last night and holy shit it was amazing!!"
"13464","@phillyhawk Funny... we were watching Shazam last night and they were showing the different places in Philly that we used to go to."

"13467","@FilmCritHULK Would you consider #SHAZAM! to be Man of Steel done right?"
"13468","Captain Marvel was decent Shazam was funny and had a good story line. Bruh made his whole squad have powers you can’t top that"
"13469","#Shazam is effing funny. Notice how the three best DC movies, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam, are all actually fun to watch. Novel idea."
"13470","Going into Shazam! I was really skeptical because of DC’s movie quality recently, but coming out of it I think it’s one of my favorite movies of all time"
"13471","@NerdWeaponX No they aren’t saying that about Antman, only because Shazam is getting positive reviews from everyone Marvel never had that problem"
"13472","Yo MCU fans need to chill,"
"13473","Blessed art"
"13474","how freaking great would it have been if we had all gone to see SHAZAM opening night and it turned out to be a stealth reboot of Gomer Pyle for the big screen?"

"13482","...while Zach Levi's Shazam/Billy was about as cartoonish and charmingly kid appropriate as could be.

I was never convinced that they were the same person, because Billy Batson was NEVER charming for funny in any of his scenes. Not once. Even their DIALOGUE was different."
"13483","Got back from SHAZAM!

It was...good. Better than I expected. It's still got that DC aesthetic though; it's show very dark, there's almost no color in the movie, and they swear a LOT; which is at contrast with stuff that is otherwise extremely charming and played well with the..."
"13484","Still! It was better than I expected it to be, and Zach Levi managed to win me over by the end of the movie, though his portrayal of Shazam VS Asher Angel's portrayal of Billy Batson was also my biggest disconnect with the movie. -__-

Asher Angel's Billy was a brooding bummer..."
"13485","So wait.....there ISN'T a Shazam movie from the 90's with Sinbad????????????????"

"13490","Unpopular opinion from what I see, but Shazam wasn't as good as everyone is making out. Its a generic superhero movie that would have been better coming out in like 2006. But the amount of superhero movies we have today its forgettable in comparison to others..."

"13528","@ZacharyLevi I know you're probably getting a million of these right now, but I've just watched @ShazamMovie and I really liked it, the fact that you're still a kid under it all gives it a fun innocence not seen in other comic book movies, and boy is it funny!

Most superhero movies are dreck, either self important, trying too hard to be woke, or just plain boring.  Shazam was just fun. Liked all the allusions, from the Shining to Big. Excellent."
"13563","Just got back from #Shazam! It was really good and wholesome movie. 10/10 would recommend."
"13564","SHAZAM! was fun and all, but... Why did the old wizard give Jimmy Fallon superpowers?

Seriously though, I think the ideas in this movie wanted just a little more room to breath, like a 6-12 hour Netflix series."

"13575","This scene was “This is my gift. My curse” level of quality. The more I think about Shazam the more thankful I am for it. 

Thank you @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel"

I honestly feel so fucking burnt out on movies PERIOD

May not even bother to see Shazam or Endgame in theatres at this point

The inconvenience of the theatre vs my rig at home (or Netflix making shit nobody demanded) made me just buy Aquaman and rip to Plex"
"13600","@ZacharyLevi did you see @TheRock give you and the crew of #ShazamMovie some big time love on Instagram. Check it out if you haven’t. Congrats on the film and its success. Loved it!"
"13601","Shazam: *does the floss* 

Me: That’s the joke"

"13608","Thoughts and prayers. <U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FD>"
"13609","Okay, so Shazam is probably my favorite DC movie thus far. It’s just got so much joy. It’s genuine in a way a lot of other cape movies haven’t really felt. Also, there wasn’t any unnecessary action scenes and the fights don’t drag, which is a big issue I’ve had with cape movies."
"13610","Just saw Shazam for the first time. Man now I understand where @LordOfCheddar is coming from, the movie is really good! Probably my favorite DCEU movie yet."
"13611","@ShazamMovie Brilliant film with plenty of laugh at moments too"
"13612","After the film, I went to the men's room, shouted #Shazam and peed for like an hour.
#superpower"
"13613","Billy continually disrespects the Doctor. 

     Actions have consequences. 

          Though the boy is safe, that is until Sivana can figure out how to transfer his power without the staff of Shazam."
"13614","WB is so dumb!!! I don't know why I'm still surprised. The headless superman, besides being unnecessary, overshadowed the entire film. One or two are talking about Shazam and co, but most of people are only talking about the cameo. DUMB BUSINESS COMPANY IN THE WORLD."
"13615","@PatrickZircher The cast makes Shazam special."
"13616","@Willh1985 @kenpanthers I’ve messaged him before about tracks but that’s been at the game. Did you try Shazam? Kids constantly using that to find out stuff"
"13617","Shazam is a two hour movie.
And Filmhouse is allowing us in 30 minutes after the scheduled time.

That meinsssssssss"
"13618","@ZBrag101 @BlackMajikMan90 @SHAAN87989064 @GiteshPandya Lol you're just offended by a stupid dance move which kids do all the time and intact it's done by a character who's 14... Deadpool is self aware and 4th wall breaker... There's absolutely no way Deadpool can be compared to Shazam. Deadpool is Rated R character Lol."

Way more violent then I thought it'd be tho...."

Really great character writing and humor. I had some issues with it, but overall I really enjoyed it"
"13629","@ShazamMovie was definitely a great movie, and I love the backstory as well"
"13630","@fluffyman85 Shazam was (in my opinion) One of the best things to come out of DC in years. Fuck all the way off with that noise."

From what I hear of Shazam from friends they really enjoyed it"

"13633","Okay #Shazam was pretty good. Fight scenes weren’t as great as #Aquaman but the story was better. This was also my formal introduction to his story so I’m impressed.

And LOL at Smallville’s Lionel Luthor getting a role in the film."

"13636","@AngryBlackLady I didn’t enjoy WW. It was hyped as all about women, but didn’t deliver (Marvel did a way better job). After leaving the island it barely passed the Bechdel test (which I understand is arbitrary, but still). I just didn’t love it. Shazam was lots of fun, I really enjoyed it."

When the devils were inside of Sivana, he became stronger(all of parts of his body, not just his eye). For the eye,it's just where the parasite attached to your body, but your entire body is sick."
"13645","@BoboDc76 @SEN1227 @dc_jp @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @geoffjohns @1moreGaryFrank I agree.  The CGI could've been better."

If the door is not there, how did you get in? I get your point, but if it was made like how you said it, shazam would become a horror movie; the devil possed a human being, and shazam would look like a priest trying to get the devil out."
"13647","@BoboDc76 @SEN1227 @dc_jp @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @geoffjohns @1moreGaryFrank And the problem is not solved yet.  The sins are still there,  in Sivana's heart.  Envy,  greed, lust (of power and recognition), all of them.  Only the devils are out, but the sins are still sticking to Sivana's heart. That's why we get the credit scene in prison."
"13648","@Caleb_Bravo99 This is the discourse I'm here for. I can see Shazam being right up there with Die Hard as movies people argue about every holiday season."
"13649","So, Shazam! was better than expected. Brighter, funnier and well suited for families. But consequently featuring less grit and seriousness than you might want if unaccompanied by kids.  I'll mull it over a bit. Felt a bit like a superhero spin on Big crossed with SuperTed."

me: :(

me: :)"
"13652","@grayghost84 @dcumoviepage Also #Shazam is a good movie, yeah the Superman thing pisses me off but the movie is fine in itself man"

Also DC: And we can throw in a dozen or so gruesome murders to desensitize children to gruesome murders... expanding the audience for our Joker movie debacle..."
"13654","Hey guys, Shazam was pretty great.  You should go see it and encourage the DC movie universe to keep putting in the effort."
"13655","@JetGrindFuture Wait, a Black Adam centered movie without Shazam? That seems a really strange choice.

Also, changing villains powers around is fine (removing Hank Pym from the Ultron equation for example), but swapping powers entirely with another character feels pointless."
"13656","Hello, I went to see the shazam movie, it was really mediocre, the shots were okay, some jokes, the okay part of the movie is the costume of shazam and I think DC is finally okay.

"13672","@friarzero yeah the Black Adam movie was even announced way BEFORE the Shazam movie,  it's a whole weird thing

"13673","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover They should give you a role in one of these movies."

"13675","@AmazonChique Ghostbusters opening weekend was fine. It's legs were mediocre and it completely bombed overseas. It would have been fine if it's budget weren't 146mil. I like Ghostbusters 16 but it wasn't a box office success. Shazam had a solid opening for it's budget but it's not a hit yet."
"13676","Also here's an idea. Instead of WB using Henry Cavill's contract to put him in couple of dire Team Up movies that fucked over his character, maybe they should have made a fucking solo Superman movie that had charm like Shazam, Aquaman and Wonder Woman?"
"13677","WB is so dumb!!! I don't know why I'm still surprised. The headless superman, besides being unnecessary, overshadowed the entire film. One or two are talking about Shazam and co, but most of people are only talking about the cameo. DUMBEST BUSINESS COMPANY IN THE WORLD."

"13692","Black Adam would be a great villain to “retcon” or “soft reboot” the Justice League. Give him an anti-hero, Egyptian mythology based origin story and then have him arrive in the present, uniting Shazam, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and hopefully Cavill’s Superman and a new Batman."
"13693","Shazam is good. Fantastic compared to other DC films."

"13710","gripping narration. Well, #WonderWoman &amp; #Aquaman were exceptions where it did lose a bit of its darkness. Justice League was a bad job altogether. But why do we get #Shazam? It was neither the #DC way of narration nor that of #MCU. It was just trying hard to be a kid (2/n)"
"13711","#Shazam has a great nod to Tom Hanks’ Big and I let out an audible “well done!” during this scene lol"
"13712","Nitpicks about #SHAZAM:  Villain suffers from super villain syndrome in that his motivation is nonexistent. Also the final battle went on a tad too long. But other then that I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Might take the top favorite spot from Wonder Woman but I need to think about that."
"13713","Also, I don't understand why a lot of these big blockbusters are being made for upwards of $200 million when #Shazam was reportedly made for $80-100 million and is just as much of a spectacle as those movies."
"13714","About to watch #SHAZAM!!"

"13725","Honest opinion #CaptainMarvel was better then #Shazam. Shazam had a bad final fight that pretty much ruined a lot of the movie. Not that funny of a movie like it was suppose to be. At some points it was really dumb. 6/10"

"13741","@SwampTalking @AceKiddoInReal @fincherism @SwampTalking dude with all due respect, the diversity was the only reason why I saw captain marvel. That and the fact that it was required.

Alan Moore has a book called Miracleman which is like a Twilight Zone version of the concept and is good"

"13762","@ShinGokaiRed @lmldias ^this.
It's the difference between show vs tell. Shazam didn't make a big deal out of it which is how diversity should be. Other movies would and have done made a big deal all while the people behind them stroked their egos."

Sorry for the negativity, but genuine heroism is not something that the DC Universe should lack.
But I’m really happy Shazam seemed to be getting good reviews."
"13771","@DerfelMacGuffin Very true, hopefully Shazam ! will get WB thinking they need to play ball. Suicide Squad having many characters and actors returning along with Deadshot not being recast is also a good sign that they’re being smarter lately"

"13773","@TheCraftingMuse @satinephoenix @kylevogt Shazam! was a lot of fun! A little grim at the beginning, but a good film for kids 10/11 and up. Like Into The Spiderverse this movie spoke to kids/tweens/teens directly - bullies, what family means, and choices."

"13778","@SwampTalking @gamingmentor101 @fincherism Exactly. They sold Shazam as what it is, a fun superhero comedy. They didn't focus on the diversity because that's not the point of the movie. It's just a natural feeling thing, like in real life, and in the comics. Not some studio-mandated decision."

"13783","I almost cried from happiness at “Shazam!”"

"13787","#Shazam was decent, not impressed, but not overly disappointed. I really wish DC could use their characters to patch something together like Marvel."
"13788","@AmazonChique Shazam cost half as much to make as Ghostbusters, hence it didn’t need as big of an opening to be a success"
"13789","@TepidSharkTake2 His motivation was envy. He wanted Shazam’s powers because he was not deemed worthy by the wizard yet Billy was. That was very clearly explained"
"13790","@AngryJoeShow Justice League was so cool. Not a perfect film, but to see all those cool heroes fight next to each other was incredible! I just love these films! I hope Shazam shows up in Justice League 2!"
"13791","About a certain cameo in #Shazam. Didn't like it when I heard about it, didn't like it when actually saw it. It's... depressing."

"13810","I know I’m not the only one who will say it, but #Shazam is the SUPERIOR #CaptainMarvel. Better written, flawed hero who is inspiring and we want to see succeed, better villain, better supporting cast and a wholesome universal message that isn’t jammed down our throats. FACTS!"
"13811","I’ll try and do a #Shazam review video when my phone’s fully charged. Either today or tomorrow. And hopefully I will be able to do it because apparently @YouTube has gone and flutzed around with how its users are able to make content, again."

"13822","@SimmerJonny @Iron_Cgull It's really worth it. I expected a super hero parody with a silly kind of humor, but it turns out the movie is funny and surprisingly touching. <U+0001F62E> Oh, and stay there until the very end, because there are two additional scenes. ;)#ShazamMovie"
"13823","There's plenty of time this month for Shazam, Pet Sematary, Hellboy, and the Curse of La Llarona to make good money before Endgame.

Two Things:
1- Some of my friends watched Shazam and they said they liked it, but didn’t love it because there were most like kids in the audience.
2- Shazam was going up against Dumbo, Us, and Captain Marvel and I think many people rewatched Captain Marvel again because..."
"13825","@kirkneverdied @smilingldsgirl I think the problem was the advanced screening two weeks ago.
Many people who are fans of #Shazam saw it early and I think didn’t bother to show up when it was released.
I think the final domestic take for Shazam will be 190$ million and 557$ Million worldwide."

"13834","@LiveUrTruthLars @ZacharyLevi Ha ha!!!  We got to see it a couple weeks ago at an early sneak peek preview and the audience was so fun. Friday night there were people shouting “don’t go in there” to all the kids going into the door after Dr. Sivana and Shazam. Sooooo funny."

"13899","@VueYork just been to watch Shazam, disappointed the lights where left on to distract us from the film, give us eye strain and a banging headache for the hour drive home!"
"13900","Getting ready to watch #Shazam !!! Bring it!"
"13901","@ZacharyLevi Just saw #Shazam and loved it. My favorite DC movie yet :) My 12 year old daughter yelled Shazam as she used her ""super speed"" to run to the car afterward. I have a feeling we will be hearing it a lot."
"13902","i love them omg"
"13903","Bruh I gotta see Shazam, Hellboy comes out this week and Endgame at the end of the month..... #broke"
"13904","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover @RealJohnGlover was awesome in it"
"13905","Ok get ready for spoilers. Shazam has Shazams and Superman."
"13906","Shazam 150% met all of my expectations. I said it would be DC’s best movie and I was definitely right. 9/10"
"13907","Going to see ""Shazam!"" tonight. Hopefully this Captain Marvel will be better than the other one. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed Marvel's Captain Marvel, but it all seemed like someone getting out of an abusive relationship. I need some joy in my moves everyone once in a while."

"13909","@snarkknight01 I know the new Shazam run that’s going on right now is all about the Shazam kids discovering the other realms"
"13910","Shazam looks so bad I really want it to be good but I..... I can’t."
"13911","@DFF_Shane @DFFMemphis Yes he is but I don’t even remember who the villain of Shazam was nor do I know who this caterpillar is"
"13912","After reading a lot of post release Shazam! reviews I feel like people might be exaggerating Sivana’s purpose as a “foil” as though it’s a real, heavy, flaw with the plot."
"13913","I’m not sure how I’d rank Shazam, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman in terms of excellence — but I’d put all three at the top of a list and BvS, Justice League, MoS, and Suicide Squad at the bottom. 

Big difference when each movie gets to be its own thing."
"13914","Just watched #Shazam today and I totally loved it. It was really a great movie, although I didn't get to watch the post-credit scenes <U+0001F629>, definitely going to watch again, missed the first 20 mins or so, nevertheless, it was a great and fun movie. Will rate it 8.5/10"
"13915","Shazam was incredible, don’t even put it in the same sentence as that slow mo fest Wonder Woman"
"13916","Comics Update
JLD and Daredevil are great
JL and GL and Shazam also great
MM and Spidey and Venom those too are great
Tec also pretty great
Don't forget GOTG bc thats great as well
So what I'm saying is....
Comics are great"
"13917","In the past 20 hours I've watched #Dumbo , #PetSematary and #Shazam lol ..."
"13918","Pet Sematary was a disappointment yesterday.  Hopefully, #SHAZAM will be better.  <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"13919","Pet Sematary was kind of a disappointment yesterday.  Hopefully, #Shazam will be better."
"13920","Just got home from seeing #Shazam in the theaters. Talk about a great film to see with the kids."
"13921","Evan talking to celebrities like they are casual friends is the most Evan thing imaginable"
"13922","@victorlavalle My son and I loved Captain Marvel; looking forward to Shazam!"
"13923","Brother never saw the Joker trailer because he thought it would be connected to Suicide Squad and be retarded.

I'm really hopin they show the Joker trailer before Shazam now cuz I wanna see the look on his face"
"13924","@AqeelDC I thought Aquaman could take the 1st place but, I can’t do it. Man Of Steel is still my favorite! Though, from all of these I think a sequel of Shazam including Black Adam could be easily number #1. Had to say that. Shazam was awesome!"
"13925","Shazam was well done. Interesting how the lesser known heroes at DC have done better than the top two, Batman and Superman. It could be that Batman and Superman already have such iconic film histories that it’s tough to live up to break any new ground."
"13926","Well -- As I sigh a huge relief.

@ShazamMovie is terrific. Loved the story, performances by @ZacharyLevi, who is fantastic as Zhazam. Thank you for making him work!!!  To the entire cast and crew  that is just as wonderful. You all killed it."
"13927","I loved it.  Loads of fun and that's what I wanted from it."
"13928","You didnt put much thought into this tweet. Think about that."
"13929","Shazam actually came out pretty damn good."
"13930","Had a great time with my kids at #Shazam today. One of the best movies ever and made even better when my Ellie said, “Mom! Chuck’s a super hero!” We hope to see more of this hero soon @ZacharyLevi"
"13931","I'm bored and I just caught up to the new Shazam run. Any comic reading recommendations like Iron Man or something?"
"13932","Really loved how they handled [REDACTED] it was super true to the comics. And honestly looking forward to if they make more Shazam movies."
"13933","Surprised and overjoyed to see @MeaganGood in #Shazam. Soooo happy for her!"
"13934","@fandomreactions Have you seen Shazam yet?"
"13935","@_SilverKrystel_ @juandoomin @shenanigansen Nope

Now a TRADEMARK is more likely

It's ENTIRELY why Captain Marvel has existed

Otherwise DC would have the audacity to refer to Shazam by his OG name"
"13936","@ZacharyLevi as Shazam was awesome. I thought you were awesome as Chuck, dude, you just stole the DC Universe..."
"13937","Shazam was fun. Some of the best laughs in any superhero movie ever. Next week: Game of Thrones!!!!!"
"13938","@CyrusShepard @jroakes I watched Shazam by myself and wished I had taken my wife and kids. It is a lot of fun"
"13939","@DudesofCinema I agree. They've lost their fucking minds and it's getting tiresome. JL was a god awful movie and we need to move on from that bullshit. Aquaman was fantastic, Shazam was dope, and I can't wait for that Black Adam movie"
"13940","@nomedval_ literally the wizard in shazam"
"13941","Toronto's film, television and digital media industry employs more than 30,000 of your talented neighbours. Films like #SHAZAM are #MadeHereSeenEverywhere. #xoTO"
"13942","By not using tokens and just having developed characters....you know that thing we keep asking for you call racist...."
"13943","Gonna try and go back to not tweeting now at least, my next tweet will probably be my Shazam review yeee"
"13944","#SHAZAM is #1 in the world this weekend.

That’s it.
That’s the tweet."
"13945","About to watch Shazam! I love Zachery Levi so I’m excited. 

Fun fact this is the first DCU movie I’ve paid to see in theaters lol."
"13946","Oh ya'll posting Shazam spoilers? That's a unfollow."
"13947","I love @ZacharyLevi and @AsherAngel in @ShazamMovie are incredible actors <U+0001F49C>"
"13948","lesson learned from Shazam: daddy issues make you evil and mommy issues make you a hero"
"13949","@JacksonBrittsny Wonder Woman is my fave DC movie but Shazam is a close second."
"13950","And if I forgot to mention, my B, I suffer from CRS (can’t remember shit). Really had a blast and am looking forward to seeing Shazam! #rectumvondectum"
"13951","Saw #SHAZAM today. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not all that excited to see Dark Phoenix, they still haven't sold me on that one yet. But I am totally jazzed to see Detective Pikachu!"
"13952","Seeing Shazam in an hour. Kinda pumped"
"13953","I would love this!"
"13954","Hey @ZacharyLevi which intersect version is this?"
"13955","Not sure about this, but my new thing is shouting 'shazam' just at the time I bust my nut."
"13956","Best weekend in a long time, got to saw shazam which was the best super hero movie in a while, caught up on rest, and now WrestleMania."
"13957","@Jeans_Stream I recommend Superman/Shazam First Thunder its so good."
"13958","What the hell is at all appealing to make anyone want to see this? I can't be the only one that thinks it looks worse than the 90s Disney Channel movies"
"13959","Thought I should mention. Shazam! Was amazing, and Zachary Levi is my favorite actor <U+0001F49B>"
"13960","Sorry for no streams the past two days. Friday I went to a local play, Saturday I saw #Shazam, and today I was celebrating friends birthday!

There will be no stream today as I havent had a brake and I'm exhausted! 
I will be live tomorrow!"
"13961","@ZacharyLevi Thank you got Shazam! It is the Superhero movie everyone deserves. It’s the best DCEU movie ever. #SHAZAM"
"13962","I’d agree! And the same goes for Bob Dylan! But every other coffee shop I’ve worked at has played the entire discography of both artists and there’s a reason why you never hear them in movies. Not pretentious enough <U+0001F604>"
"13963","Just out of the theater from watching Shazam and it’s one of the most comic accurate comic films which is great! (SLIGHT SPOILERS) The movie plays out just like the comic the only difference is that Black Adam was the one who wants Shazam’s power in the comic not Dr. Sivana."
"13964","I ran out of space for Pops... and I still want the Shazam! ones <U+0001F97A> (PSA don’t look them up, the collection itself is a spoiler)"
"13965","I ran out of space for Pops... and I still want the Shazam! ones <U+0001F97A> (PSA don’t look them up if you haven’t seen the movie, the collection itself is a spoiler)"
"13966","Just finished watching Shazam. Really sweet film. I can see so many kids relating and enjoying the hell out of it. Loved the foster family aspect of the film that is often overlooked and misrepresented in media. Watching this reminded me of my first time watching Spider-Man"
"13967","The first DC movie I’ve seen in theaters from a die hard marvel girl. Absolutely loved it #shazam"
"13968","#SHAZAM! Is the best movie by far in the DCEU, it had a great family message and it was just a great fun superhero movie 9.5/10! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"13969","I’m glad people love #Shazam. A rare high RT score too for a DC movie. But I’d rather DC focussed on making more mature content. Shazam has it’s place in the universe, don’t get me wrong. But it’s only a one time watch for me &amp; possibly for most others too."
"13970","For a 100m budget, the movie is missing alot of spectacle. Deadpool cost 58m &amp; the action was fucking insane. Shazam had excellent VFX &amp; CGI but it was very very basic. The comedy quiffs were more memorable than any action scene. That’s not what I’m looking for in a DC movie."
"13971","I can’t sit here &amp; be hypocritical about Shazam. I’ve called out numerous Marvel movies for over the top comedy &amp; the use of humour in serious situations, so I can’t just do a 180 &amp; say I liked Shazam doing the same. I enjoyed it, but only that one time. On repeat viewing..."
"13972","#Shazam was so good that I am already planning to see it again a few more times."
"13973","One of the many things that I loved about #Shazam is the diversity. #Shazamily"
"13974","Operation Shazam? Promo? #TheFlash"
"13975","@ZacharyLevi Congralutation! @ShazamMovie is a great movie. Fun and exciting #DCrises thank you @wbpictures"
"13976","#Shazam is perfectly fine. Lots of heart and it’s legitimately funny. Great cast. Overstays its welcome (not uncommon for superhero movies); “too cute” at points. It did give me something I never thought I’d see, even in today’s movies, which made me very happy. I liked it."
"13977","My sis went to watch Shazam in Seoul and in one scene they say ""I'm bulletproof"" and the Korean subtitles translate it as ""<U+BC29><U+D0C4><U+C774><U+C57C>"" I think is the proper translation but still it's super funny <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>

"13978","@SinemiaSupport I'm trying to watch Shazam and it keeps erroring out with no explanation."
"13979","We also give our spoiler-free review of Shazam! Even though it’s not #Disney, we share our thoughts on #DC’s newest superhero. We wrap it all up with a discussion of the Disney Stories of the Week, including major #Marvel milestones and #DisneyParks news!"

"13982","What we learn from Shazam is that: blood doesn’t equal family. 

Rather, family is defined by those you choose to keep in your life, who love you just as much."
"13983","@ZacharyLevi I’ve seen Shazam three times. 

Once in 4D, once in 3D, and once in 2D. 

I have to say, 4D was a blast. #SHAZAM"
"13984","See Shazam in theaters for eternal youth"
"13985","#Shazam was fun. DC and WB are moving in the right direction."
"13986","the guy that i yelled at while driving to dinner is now in the same showing of shazam LOL"
"13987","Shazam=actually good"
"13988","What was the goal of the villain in Shazam, incidentally? Not the monsters but the man. I feel like maybe he forgot to have a goal about halfway through the movie."
"13989","watching shazam with your friends and they ended up loving zachary levi and the whole cast &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"
"13990","@DesertGamer5000 Tough. Shazam (Captain Marvel still fits him better) has matched Superman in strength and Thor has shifted Yggdrasil and the world engine back into place.

I'll go with Thor though. Can't think of anything Shazam can throw at him that he can't handle"
"13991","@TheOnlyJamesMan Black Adam will begin filming next March, so it would be so hard to release it on 2020, probably 2021, although I also doubt 2021 as they're already releasing 3 DC movies that year, The Batman, Super Pets, and The Suicide Squad. So, probably 2022 and Shazam! 2023, unless"
"13992","@CheapyD are you talking about after the first 40 minutes into the movie when you finally hear Shazam spoken?   I bet @NewWombat and @Shipwreck differ with you on the movie."
"13993","@J_Friendly @JohnnySobczak @AmazonChique And #Shazam has already grossed over 150 Mil. It'll do fine."
"13994","@Kevfeige @Russo_Brothers  @RobertDowneyJr (I’ve not seen Shazam.) I think DC uses character challenges as defining trigger events to thrust forward a dramatic choice for heroism. Development from that point is less inward focused… &amp; more reactions to big booms. 2/5"
"13995","@realalextalking @kirkneverdied @RealGunnarJames Hey, some of us caught Shazam during the Fandango preview a couple of weeks ago. Lol"
"13996","I was wondering why Dwayne Johnson’s name was in the credits. This explains it."
"13997","Catching the @ShazamMovie right now!!! Popcorn <U+2705> Beverage <U+2705>. Now give me some @ZacharyLevi !!! #SHAZAM"
"13998","@ShazamMovie Saw this today very entertaining movie funny"
"13999","I just saw Shazam and it's just so much fun"
"14000","Shazam is a fun and wholesome movie to watch, definitely something I recommend for a family outing"
"14001","Lady its not that simple"
"14002","@RottenTomatoes This might just might be a movie <U+0001F3A5> to watch out for... Shazam!!! You never know?? It could be a franchise????"
"14003","Just saw #ShazamMovie and I don’t think they are going to@come out with a part two.. not that it’s not a good movie but the part of Silvana was basically @TheRock ‘s part. Should they make a part two with Black Adam now? Some guy with the same powers?"
"14004","Had lots of fun watching Shazam. Thanks for the fun performance!"

"14006","The SHAZAM movie was aight. Decent origin flick. 6.95/10"
"14007","Shazam is a ton of fun!"
"14008","i’m about to see shazam x"
"14009","Shazam is pretty wholesome. Went in for Zachary Levi (remember Chuck?) and it was a good time. <U+26A1><U+FE0F> Glad they still do hero movies that you don't have to see other 361 ones to understand ha <U+0001F605>"
"14010","Shazam is the best Superhero movie since Infinity War"
"14011","Shazam literally showed my worst fear: finding my birth mom and having her not want me and y’all can’t even IMAGINE how bad I cried."
"14012","Most films don't do well domestically, because they are not made to serve the country that made them."
"14013","Shazam was a fantastic superhero movie. The acting was great, the script was well written and the characters were very great. Some scenes felt cliche, but that didn’t matter when the movie gives you everything you wanted. Props to @ponysmasher for an amazing film. 8.5/10"
"14014","@jhammer4975 @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi I'm hoping to watch that movie soon. There are so many good films being released right now but I don't want to spend away all my money on them."
"14015","My new favourite thing to go around shouting is “Shazam!” <U+26A1><U+FE0F> #ShazamMovie #awesome"
"14016","@RaymondArroyo @ShazamMovie I thought, that they could have left out the bad swearing and strip club stuff for the family viewing. Now some parents will have to explain what that was about, and why men were there. Not a prude, just sayin’"
"14017","So #Shazam was a lot of fun - something that DC movies (and Captain Marvel) have sorely missed. The cinematography, however, is not great. So don't fret if you can't go to the theater to see it."
"14018","Thinking of watching US and Shazam back to back on tuesday <U+0001F636>"
"14019","Now that #Shazam is in the books, which upcoming DC universe film are you most excited about?

(excluding JOKER since it’s not canon)"
"14020","@RottenTomatoes Good for #Shazam , I was entertained from start to finish.
Also a decent opening for #PetSematary , looking forward to see it.
Always happy when movies do good at the box office."
"14021","@MakeMineAmalgam Isn't he STILL Captain Marvel? In Earth-S where he has been Captain Marvel ever since and New-52 Shazam was never CM and from Earth 0? They're two different iterations from two different Earths. Like Supergirl and Power Girl. 

Correct me if I'm wrong though."
"14022","@saintwalker98 @ProfofEvil By the way, I was a little surprised to find that Shazam! is still pretty solidly part of the larger DCCU, even if it's just a few Easter eggs. He's one character I think works better in his own little bubble universe (as, indeed, he originally was)"
"14023","DC is on a roll. Starting with Justice League (ignore critics; it was a great movie), then Wonder Woman and Aquaman, and now Shazam (solidly good movie); they’ve had a run of four successful movies in a row. Hope they can keep momentum going. Need a strong DC and a strong Marvel."
"14024","@TheItalianPole that is very good, i have always like shazam"
"14025","Loved #Shazam A really strong film with heart &amp; a lovely message. Shame about the one cameo..... &amp; once again another one could have been used..... 

Will be really interesting to see where the DCEU is going."
"14026","taking my brother to see shazam today so he can support his favorite actor... JACK DYLAN GRAZER..."
"14027","@ShazamMovie DCEU finally going in the right direction"
"14028","Why is this #Shazam movie so fucking bad Jesus Christ"
"14029","We saw Shazam and it was very entertaining, would recommend XD"
"14030","@mzcutedimplez Id have to see it to relate sha.saw the trailer and I felt like Get out was better. You should see Shazam too, best DC movie in a while in my opinion,"
"14031","@mzcutedimplez Twitter people beg to differ, someone made a whole thread about the movie being overrated. Shazam was fire tho..i made the right choice it seems"
"14032","I’m old so I wonder if anybody walked into #CaptainMarvel expecting to see #ShazamMovie @DcComicsUnited @MarvelStudios"
"14033","Im glad that DC seems to be wanting to dip into really weirdass villains (if Shazam's post credits is any indication)"
"14034","@dc_connections Shazam determines the future of the Snyder cast"
"14035","Just saw #Shazam <U+2607> It was so fun! The trailers don't tell the full story. It's nice to still be surprised at the movies."
"14036","After watching Us and Shazam! I found a new film cliché which is having a film begin in the past where they state a specific year and flash forward to the year the film takes place but instead of saying that year it just says the present or today. Seriously a lot of films do it."
"14037","Shazam! truly shows that DC has got movies down well now. That was the best superhero movie since Thor Ragnarok! <U+0001F60A>"
"14038","Shazam review: I wasn’t ready for all these feelings."
"14039","@MarkKolpack @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi I think we had the same reaction. I was worried it would be to immature and to cheesy so to speak. The trailer actually worried me. In the end, I walked out pleased and satisfied. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a very good movie and will see it again."
"14040","I just finished watching Shazam and I highly recommend it!"
"14041","Shazam is on a $85-100 million budget and is total opening was $158+ million. 

If $53 million of that total is just domestic, I'd be damn proud.

BO is RELATIVE."

"14046","Ok... Shazam was AWESOME... Really well done, funny and entertaining.
DC seems to finally be stepping up their game."
"14047","Shazam! really is that great. Three times in and still utterly delighted."
"14048","@MartinJGallegos I saw Shazam today it’s better I didn’t sit through the As obligatory sweep by the astros"
"14049","Shazam was great. Glad to see the DC universe putting their shit together."
"14050","I just saw #Shazam. The thing that struck me most about it was the sheer tonal contrast between the hero and the villain. The hero is a goofball kid and the villain is a super creepy demonic guy. That was...interesting."
"14051","@tvaher94 @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi I totally agree! April is crammed with great films!"
"14052","Got back from seeing #Shazam. Honest opinion... Its fucking hilarious, it has a great evil character, Its caught up to date, it has touching parts. 

I loved it. I recommend you guys see it as well in your spare time. <U+0001F499>"
"14053","Both Captain Marvel and Shazam were fun."

"14059","Just saw #Shazam yesterday with my friends, it was such an amazing experience!!! Thanks @ZacharyLevi !!!! We love the movie!!!!"
"14060","@Allenfire Hmm nice. Didn't know there were 7 movies.. 

MoS
BvS
WW
Aquaman
Shazam!
Suicide Squad

Pretty close to yours, MoS and BvS are basically a coin flip for me and I have to give Shazam the edge over Squad bc it's more solid as a film even though I really enjoy Squad."
"14061","guys I saw #Shazam and HOLY shit do I have a lot of thoughts"
"14062","After seeing @ZacharyLevi ‘s SHAZAM! , I can’t believe how amazing it was. I mean my little bro and I don’t always get along but after watching it, we literally couldn’t stop shouting SHAZAM! and hoping we’d get powers too. Shazam lives in all of us <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14063","I deal a lot with issues with my mother and regarding mental health like depression and PTSD. Shazam really made me feel like I could do anything, that I WAS Shazam. Thank you @ZacharyLevi for making me feel like I had hope once more <U+0001F49C>"
"14064","Just finished watching #Shazam It's an incredibly fun movie, it's refreshing and funny and quite light hearted compared the rest of the DCEU. It's a great watch and highly recommend it. 

It's a very very fun watch!"
"14065","Shazam was good film. I hope DC can keep the momentum going with their next production."
"14066","Ain’t heard no type of reviews about Shazam. Let’s see how this goes"
"14067","About to see the movie Shazam, where I really hope the character Shazam says the word Shazam to turn into Shazam so he can Shazam some villains. Will report if this happens after watching the film."
"14068","@ponysmasher Hard to say how I'm impressed since you've made the short ""Lights Out"", then your first movies and now ""Shazam"". It was a blast and I need more. You rock! Greetings from France <U+0001F919>"

"14071","Just got back from #Shazam. Just go see it-- well worth the hype and SO well done. I knew very little about this franchise and I've been made a new fan. I can't write a glowing enough review. Loved it! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

"14078","@AlphaOmegaSin Hopefully not 58 hours I gotta go watch Shazam tomorrow morning"
"14079","I will say this, it’s disappointing that Marvel and DC (or Disney &amp; WB) don’t promote their comic books prior to the film b/c the current Shazam book by Johns and Eaglesham is the perfect comic for people who want more of Shazam! So similar in tone &amp; it’s just as fun if not more!"
"14080","Now, I didn’t get up and cheer like my 10 year old self while watching Shazam!, but I really wanted to! This movie was so much fun! Probably the most fun I have had in a theater. We got the ****** ****** in LIVE-ACTION! I won’t say what b/c spoiler (atleast I think it was?) AHH!!"
"14081","Bout to watch #SHAZAM"
"14082","I really hope this is the new direction going forward with the DCEU. Wonder Woman was good, Shazam was fantastic &amp; Aquaman was okay with a promising future. 

I’ll be very excited for Flash if they get rid of Ezra."
"14083","Super excited to see @ShazamMovie tomorrow #Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14084","i’m going to see shazam today even if i go by myself"
"14085","this is currently me rn about to watch shazam"
"14086","I liked the Ghostbusters reboot and MRAs are terrible, but this is not an apples-to-apples comparison; productions budgets, marketing budgets, brand value and timing are among the necessary context when comparing performance."
"14087","@IDPwithBEE I haven’t seen aquaman yet... I know some people like Shazam and the fact that it cost $90 million and made almost $60 million opening weekend is gonna be a win for them considering it’s all lesser known actors..."
"14088","@calystarose Shazam was so good!! I was not expecting it to be that good!!"
"14089","Shazam is the best DC Comics movie by a mile."
"14090","PC wholeheartedly recommends Shazam!"
"14091","Totally dig late night movies at the cinema <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FE>.. 

Shazam was lit haha"
"14092","rn it's between shazam and ww, but man of steel will forever be that bitch"
"14093","Whose taking me to watch Shazam???"
"14094","Shazam! Was super fun. I bet if it were a marvel movie the role of Santa would’ve gone to Stan Lee."
"14095","Just watched Shazam in Rochester MN. The crowd was very excited about about both these things."
"14096","Shazam is good

Unicorn Store is good

Things are good"
"14097","Yo #Shazam was actually fantastic. The film... not the app. Although the app is pretty impressive, too."
"14098","SHAZAM is shockingly good. I had a genuine blast in the theater, totally didn't expect how much fun I'd have."
"14099","Shazam! was great. Predictable and simple but great. Complete tonal shift for the DCEU but it worked for this movie at least. I’d definitely put it behind Aquaman in the number 3 spot. 86 I’m thinking"
"14100","shazam hands down no discussion I love all of y’all but shazam is on that new new shit"
"14101","Bryce and Chuck I felt things"
"14102","Yall... he’s going to kick each and every one of those kids ass"
"14103","@AdeelofSteel I saw it last month! It was hilariously good with a lot of heart. 

#Shazam will have you crying with laughter, plenty of emotional scenes and great surprises too."
"14104","Shazam tells us that 'envy' is the most toxic-heart thing that should we shallowed as fast as we can"
"14105","Finally watching Shazam tonight"
"14106","enjoyed Shazam, and really enjoyed the new Godzilla footage I got to see before that, can't wait for that movie"
"14107","@ZacharyLevi has done such a stellar job bringing #Shazam to life. A perfect balance of cute silliness and dark monster mayhem. Definitely refreshing to see @The_DCEU bring the character to life and I absolutely cannot wait for the sequels. Captain Sparkle Fingers for the win!!!"
"14108","I had no interest in seeing SHAZAM until I read Zachary Levi’s twitter. Now I rlly rlly want to see SHAZAM"
"14109","Shazam knew exactly what movie it was, didn’t take itself too seriously, didn’t talk down to its audience, had a big-ass heart! Was it perfect? Absolutely not. Was it fun? Double absolutely."
"14110","I just want to talk about Shazam. 1st Aquaman and now this? Joy has been liberally injected into the WB/DC-Verse!"
"14111","Welp, watched Shazam and yeah...it’s not for me. I really love the idea of some 11-year-old using this as their venture into their first “dark” movie, but it didn’t click with me. 

Things I loved though:
Billy Batson &amp; his family
Mark Strong existing
The mid-credit scene"
"14112","@Marvel Your Captain Marvel made over a BILLION dollars, but THEIR Captain Marvel is about to IGNITE!!"
"14113","So initial Shazam thoughts: It was overall a good movie. Another One! From DC! It really nailed the 14 year old getting super powers thing."
"14114","That new Jesus movie previewed before Shazam and everyone in the theater audibly groaned. Good to know there are some people left in Clackamas I can trust"
"14115","Okay. So I grew up reading SHAZAM! comics. Also, loved @Handlebrody in The O.C., Grind, In the Land of Women, and more. At a matinee this afternoon, Christmas came early for me. #CaptainMarvelJr"
"14116","@Handlebrody, I saw SHAZAM! today at a matinee with friends. Your appearance onscreen was one of the best surprises I've enjoyed at the movies in recent memory. THANK-YOU for so flawlessly bringing one of my childhood heroes to life."
"14117","@Dumbo Actually #1 is Shazam... but nice try"
"14118","So is John Glover just going to play every DC Comics supervillain's dad from now on? #ShazamMovie #Smallville"
"14119","Sitting down waiting for #Shazam. So excited for this movie. 

#cinemark #DCUNIVERSE"
"14120","Saw Shazam!
Bad news: apparently bouncing back from this depressive episode means having anxiety attacks during and after movies
Good news: I did watch nearly all of the movie and it is super good"
"14121","I know I've said I'm tired of superhero movies, but damn Shazam was freaking great"
"14122","@velvetlegend Really you are one of my fav mutuals
Did you see my Shazam review?"
"14123","I just found out that Ross Butler is in Shazam. OK, time to watch."
"14124","Just finished watching Shazam. I give it a 7/10. If it was a Marvel film I'd give it a 5/10. Missed opportunity imo I actually liked the guy that played Shazam by the end of the movie though. But it's one of the weakest origin movies I've ever seen. Didn't really explain much"
"14125","Can someone please be my bodyguard when I go to rewatch Shazam in theaters today? I dont want to be beat up again."
"14126","@RumpleFugs Oooh! I haven't seen it yet, me and my SO went and saw Cpt Marvel today though. Dunno what all the fuss is about, @brielarson fit the character perfectly fine IMHO

How did Chuck as Shazam work out? <U+0001F92D>"
"14127","Why is it that once a new DC movie comes out people automatically start shitting on BvS? I really like Shazam and BvS but then you get so many others that use liking one to take shots at the other. It gets exhausting after a while.<U+0001F613>"
"14128","Shazam was actually an amazing movie <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>@ShazamMovie"
"14129","Thoughts on #Shazam"
"14130","@Wei_z_Mei @jumbogumbo4 @ShazamMovie The only things they find funny in English movies are gay jokes
No seriously, the theaters are dead silent during most movies until someone makes a gay joke, then there’s riotous laughter for 5 seconds then silence again"
"14131","@UberKryptonian So does this mean we have @TheRock to thank for making #Shazam a solo film and not combining it with #BlackAdam? Nice"
"14132","I hope people go support @ShazamMovie. It’s deserving - a film with something for all ages. The foster family beats are on point. I was smiling nearly the entire runtime. Credit the cast &amp; don’t ignore the talented @ponysmasher, who continues to make satisfying films each outing."
"14133","Justice vs Doom movie idea @DCCinematicU @DCComics hero's #Wonderwoman #Shazam #aquaman recast  batman or introduced  #nightwing take up the mantel of #batman as for #Superman recast or have him turn into #bizarro"
"14134","I finally watched Shazam! today. such a heartful movie, definitely joins chrismukkah movie list. 

the o.c. reference for THAT appearance"
"14135","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover Can’t wait to see it."
"14136","And while Wonder Woman will still be the best live action female superhero film out at the moment, the sequel has a run for it's money when it comes to #Shazam"
"14137","So a few bit of a SPOILERS to #Shazam 

1. Sounds like they've already laid down the foundations for a Black Atom opponent. He will most likely the final boss to Shazam or the next one

2. Sounds like Sivana is going to come back as some kind of minor villain in the next movie"
"14138","So I just saw #Shazam and I must say that this movie is clearly the best DCEU movie of the bunch. What makes this movie stick out is the fact that it's written like one of those coming of age storylines from something like the Goonies first and then a Superhero movie second."
"14139","I was doubtful but just saw #Shazam and can understand now why it’s been getting great reviews. Perfect amount of action, humor, and wit! Highly recommend it and really appeals to all ages."
"14140","Went to see #Shazam expecting to be disappointed AND I was wrong! Excited to see the DC universe bring in more comedy and wit into their storylines. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"14141","Man, SHAZAM! Is a hecking great movie. Best Superman movie we’ve ever gotten especially."
"14142","If your a democrat it’s all good I guess. Sorry to hear that"
"14143","Shoutout to the older lady who asked my friends as credits rolled: “did that have anything to do with Power Rangers?” #SHAZAM"
"14144","Anyways I'm about to go see Shazam with my family and I'll try to work on the updates afterwards. I'm a mess I KNOW"
"14145","@ClassyUlysses @TheFliteCast What people have not realized that Shazam is the last child of the universe designed'prsnyder,as architect of DCU,  he was active in the great successes,  MEn of steel, writer of Wonder woman (also filmed scenes) and consulted by jes wan by request of this and producer of both"
"14146","I impressed with the villain on Shazam tbh"
"14147","Oooo Shazam tonight with all the baessss"
"14148","So in summary, it's an amazing N52 Shazam movie which has to only be looked from the perspective of that version. And I don't like to think ""it's not good enough"" just because of that, so I try to enjoy it as it is and I absolutely did.
It can't be denied that it's SO FUN."
"14149","I always say I'm gonna talk spoilers, but I never end doing so lol 
I prefer talking about it directly to a person or a group."
"14150","That being said, I loved it because of its magical elements and the Shazam family (or family in general) aspects. I'd totally recommend it to everyone. It's full of fun and lovely scenes and characters. David Sandberg did an amazing job along with the cast and crew!"
"14151","Ad the thing is, this version still has some Capt. Marvel bits inside, but it loses some essential part of the previous version. But I also think this one has some great elements, like the current Shazam family."
"14152","@ZacharyLevi Just saw Shazam! and as someone who suffers from severe depression, who is often on the verge of giving up, this movie....I was overcome with positive emotions I haven't experienced in a long time. Zach, Mr. Sandberg, you are both menschs."
"14153","Saw @ShazamMovie today and it was great @ZacharyLevi was awesome and so was the whole cast and @ponysmasher also did a great job"
"14154","I’m getting impatient waiting for Silver Age. My four hard cover are waiting too."
"14155","I just watched it again and LOVED IT EVEN MORE"
"14156","I can't pronounce SHAZAM properly <U+0001F602>"
"14157","I made this joke to my coworkers a couple weeks ago and no one cared"
"14158","#Shazam was freaking amazing, relatable villian, neat plot and some cool / terrifying beats thrown in there! 9/10 for sure! only problem was minor tonal issues and a random monsters inc cave. (i might have missed out on the reasoning) solid movie though."
"14159","(Sees on Twitter that WWE carted out Hogan) 

I think I made the right choice with Shazam followed by Joshi.

Thinking maybe I'll watch I think I'd rather keep catching up on TJPW and maybe a Arsion show for a change of pace."
"14160","Hey if anyone in the twitterverse knows who did the Shazam end credit title sequence please send them my way so I can shower them with compliments"
"14161","So #Shazam....I have a new favorite DCU movie. This movie is just as much about family and what family really means as it is a “Superhero” movie. Go and see it. Trust me #DCU #Movies"
"14162","@DCComics @ShazamMovie I really enjoyed the movie, every detail  was placed perfectly, was way better tan expected<U+26A1>"
"14163","Genuinely surprised by how good #Shazam is. And one of the funniest films that's come out recently."
"14164","Is anyone else gonna make the joke that Fandrel didn't die in #Ragnarok, he just faked his death and came back as #Shazam ? Because that's my theory and I'm sticking to it! @ZacharyLevi"
"14165","Just saw @ShazamMovie at @RegalMovies. It's a pretty funny movie and continues a new direction for the DCEU, which is welcomed."
"14166","Shazam! is officially my second favorite Christmas movie!"
"14167","And the little boys that just jumped off a fence outside the theater and yelled Shazam and then ate shit are a mood"
"14168","i was very skeptical about #Shazam but you know what? it turned out great! it's actually quite a fun movie"
"14169","Goddamnit, there were some REALLY satisfying moments in Shazam!"
"14170","They went to see #Shazam and are now arguing about whether it’s a biopic or just a whole lot of made up horseshit. Maggie thinks it’s bs, but Alex keeps hinting she’s seen a secret DEO file. #SanversAlways"
"14171","@ZacharyLevi just watched shazam! I have to say you did an amazing job. It was spectacular and very funny. Watching it made me wanna rewatch chuck."
"14172","Should've went to see Shazam <U+0001F611>"
"14173","I had to go through the whole movie pretty much with dad complaining <U+0001F612>, but I still enjoyed it."
"14174","@ArianaKarenina Couch potato weekend mostly since plans to see Shazam! fell through. I’m rewatching Carnivàle on HBO."
"14175","Just saw Shazam. Kind of shocked how good it is. He’s a very convoluted and messy character from the comics, but they found the heart. Nice to see DC hit one out of the park."
"14176","Shazam was real good, just way to much bad language. I know dc wants to be edgy but that’s how it felt like: they were trying to be."
"14177","Sure; a superhero movie that spends the majority of its time dealing with non-hero related material. This is the kind of thing people have told me they would be willing to see for a while now; superhero movies that have the superheros doing something other than superheroing."
"14178","y’all pls go and watch shazam!! awesome movie"
"14179","anyway now that shazam is out its time for the discussion of whether its okay to ship two 14 year old foster siblings [fandom moms do not interact]"
"14180","Shazam was amazing, holy shit, I wasn't expecting that"
"14181","At #PhoenixTheatersLakeWorth to see #Shazam"
"14182","At #PhoenixTheatersLakeWorth to see # Shazam"
"14183","We’re going to look at Shazam! and know that this was the moment the powers that be decided “fuck it, we’ll just follow the Marvel model.” @ManaByte"
"14184","@OtherJoe_AJS Im about  done with the video: Ok gotta say: What i said before stands. You gave shazam a 8/10 and described why but joe gave it a 9/10 which is close to near perfect i felt theres a little too much passionate influence on that as alex and joe really i felt argued well for 8/10"
"14185","So just got out of Shazam. Solid 8 out of 10 for me. Laughed in a few places. Bit predictable, but still fun.

I'd say go see it."
"14186","Can you say ""Shazam!"" and become @ZacharyLevi ?

Asking for a friend..."
"14187","I actually really enjoyed Shazam. Was a nice, light hearted super hero movie from the DC universe."
"14188","@kimfaul I’m excited for seeing this tomorrow! I played the new Shazam DLC in LEGO DC Villains last night in preparation."
"14189","Talent right here<U+0001F447><U+0001F60D>"
"14190","Just saw Dwayne Johnson’s Shazam! thank you video on Instagram. I might be reading entirely too much into the video, but did he potentially reveal that Black Adam (he confirmed the solo movie begins filming next year) will be in a DC event movie?"

"14195","After seeing Shazam! my gf's immediate worry would be that people would write/draw/make porn of the characters just because they were child with powers that gave them an adult body. And it's a genuine worry. So please don't do that, jfc."

"14204","@DementedMinx @ToddHagopian @nickgillespie @morganisawizard @BradThor @justinamash @MarkRPellegrino @LarrySharpe @TRHLofficial @AOC @adamkokesh Well then as an aside, Shazam is REALLY good. Like no joke. The DCEU may finally be on the right track with this one."
"14205","my review of Shazam (2019) is that there was a guy in the row in front of me that said “bruh” during every suspenseful moment in the film so I don’t know what the f u c k is expected of me"
"14206","Decided to go watch Shazam since they sponsored @Aric_Almirola and I’ve got to say that was a really awesome movie. 10/10 would definitely recommend it."

"14209","Had a great time watching Shazam with the kids today. Fun movie. 

It’s nice to see a superhero movie where the fate of the entire world/universe/galaxy isn’t at stake."
"14210","Beau wrote up a great list of content warnings for Shazam!"

#petsemetary #PetSemetary #PetSematarymovie #smallyoutuber #youtuber #smallyoutubers"
"14214","Watched #Shazam and did I enjoyed the hell out of it. Easily the best of recent DC movies. Glad to see DC Films back on track. Major props to @ponysmasher and @ZacharyLevi for a great job on this one."
"14215","See!! RT @justcallmeMS: Shazam had me dying laughing at some shit I know is gonna send me to hell"
"14216","Speaking of which go see #SHAZAM"
"14217","No reference to him being called Captain Marvel #shazam"
"14218","#Shazam is as good as the hype claims. There were several scenes that had me rolling with laughter, an incredible third act that they have somehow kept out of the trailers, and an emotional heart to tie it all together."
"14219","@dc_connections I'm still open to watch it around week 3. getting mixed reviews/recommendations, though. Need to check for myself. For me it's important, how much Shazam is in line with the Man of Steel and BvS continuity. If it is, I'm fine."
"14220","The thing I liked the most is that it didn’t take itself too seriously. So many of the Zak Snyder monstrosities were just so unintentionally hilarious."
"14221","@TestKitchen211 Most of it. And that’s why I was so happy about Shazam."
"14222","SHAZAM is really fun"

The air completely left my chest when you-know-who showed up, even though I already knew he was gonna be in the movie.

Like I dunno it felt really good t'see him on the silver screen again and by God WB better start putting him in good movies."
"14224","@DCComics @ShazamMovie They were stupid for releasing it now, because even of it's a good movie, when Endgame rolls around, it'll be done for them."
"14225","Well i overall liked #Shazam , it was funny, some very good moments like the crocodiles on suits and the dialogue in the sky.

But it also was too much like a typical superhero movie for my taste"
"14226","@ZacharyLevi Shazam was amazing!!! So proud. I remember watching ‘Less Than Perfect’ and loving everything you did. So cool to see you from there to a Disney prince to a FREAKING SUPERHERO. Love you dude"
"14227","just saw shazam it was really good, i was exited the whole movie and the only reason i wanted to leave was to pee

(I held it in the while movie and took a phat piss after)"
"14228","Is #Shazam really a Christmas movie. Just watched it. Definitely felt that way to me. Loved it"
"14229","@nikgeerken @ponysmasher Hmm. I assumed it was an oblique reference to Mike Moran, the secret identity of Marvelman/Miracleman, a character that was essentially a rip-off of Captain Mavel/Shazam, but famously written by Alan Moore."
"14230","Does the movie ""Shazam"" work because it defines good &amp; evil AND portrays the power of sanctifying grace over evil?"
"14231","@ZacharyLevi just finished watching #Shazam for the 2nd time In less than 24 hours and it was just as fun the second time around <U+2764><U+FE0F>"

"14233","@csszrr @AllbrightNFL Original Captain Marvel lost trademark because infringed on copyright of Superman so Marvel comics claimed the name. Then DC bought Fawcett and could no longer call the comic captain marvel but it was still his name until they changed it officially to Shazam in 2011"
"14234","Shazam was everything I wanted and more. I loved it so much. It’s the best DC movie since the Dark Knight. Drop whatever you’re doing and go see this movie"
"14235","Check out ""Ep 45: Shazam movie review "" on #spotify, #stitcher, and #applepodcasts"
"14236","@DeeCeeGrayson With comic book characters that went through revisions over the decades, I get it when one of those versions is your most relateable.

Studios having to pick a version for film portrayal can lose some of those fans. Or leave some slightly conflicted. #Shazam is that for you.

"14250","turns out my friends cancelled on me to just go see shazam without me <U+0001F60C><U+2728><U+2728> all my irls hate me streaks"
"14251","Love your Teesside cinema but the 10PM showing of Shazam! was empty but it must have been well over 30 degrees in there! Uncomfortable viewing! @ShowcaseCinemas"
"14252","The Captain Marvel Shazam IP Litigation Wars #MakeASequelInteresting"
"14253","@thatstarwarsgrl Yeah... After Endgame and Far From Home i’ll just watch the DC movies if they are as good as Shazam, Aquaman and Wonder Women."
"14254","@ZacharyLevi shazam is very good, I'm really proud of all the work, you're young and this is incredible. I love you because of this. @ZacharyLevi"
"14255","watched Shazam! with my family today and enjoyed it!!"
"14256","We are outchea, me and my guy watching #shazam at @vivacinemas Enugu. Lo n behold, his babe just entered holding hand with another guy. Somebody that we just took to peace park. @Coal_City is too small.

We want to call her after the movie to see if she arrived safely."
"14257","Mid-air fighting talk scene is the best scene i’ve ever saw since first ironman. Shazam mock entire superhero culture, both japan and US superhero. Damn. That was so good."
"14258","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Wonder Woman :weeww today is a beautiful day 
Shazam :we dont hav to fight the vilians

"14259","good actors make a good movie   <U+2764><U+FE0F> admiring them from argentina  <U+0001F1E6><U+0001F1F7> @ZacharyLevi  @Jgrazerofficial  #Shazam"

"14261","Every time someone mentions Shazam, I’m just thinking 80’s and @Schofe"
"14262","@ZacharyLevi u the man. Loved the movie. You are great in it #Shazam"
"14263","I hope the movie #Shazam encourages more people to become foster parents"
"14264","Shazam! was great. It had a lot of heart and blended the dumb and the serious very well. It was a damn good time."
"14265","Shazam! was perfect as a SHAZAM movie. The character is light hearted, but not every DC character has that tone. I hope DC takes away that representing characters correctly equals good movie, not light-hearted equals good movie."
"14266","@ZacharyLevi you did a great job with #ShazamMovie #Shazam I have been a fan of your work before this and you have made alot of new fans with this movie"
"14267","@ZacharyLevi geez all I had growing up with a towel with yellow flowers along the fringe and a safety pin to hold it around my neck! But my imagination worked great! Shout SHAZAM and you're instantly a superhero, flying around the yard, saving the day."
"14268","I accidently wrote Captain Marvel instead of Shazam lol. Overall I thought the movie was great. Alot of funny moments,good action scenes,and has heart. Highly recommend it"
"14269","@wishuponavlog87 I hope Shazam is as good as you hope it is for your birthday to be as perfect as you want."
"14270","A power set I'll call Pigsty. Turns anything they want into bacon. Who could say no to free bacon?"
"14271","I’m finally moving out under a rock and watching Shazam today. God."
"14272","what the god damn fuck did yms just give shazam a 7/10 (I could care less about other people’s reviews but usually he’s massively critical so holy shit)"
"14273","Shazam was SO GOOD. I have so many emotions and already want to watch it again."
"14274","So next up in the DCEU is Birds of Prey in 2020(got to nothing to say at the moment until I see a full trailer), Wonder Woman 1984 in 2020 (cool :) ), The Batman in 2021 (Trailer first), The Suicide Squad ( it in the right hands ;) ) and the Flash (please be fun like Shazam)"
"14275","@ZacharyLevi This movie is amazing. On seeing it the second time, I got even more joy out of it. It is a film with a positive message which is needed. I can’t wait for a sequel to happen. Every other year we need a Shazam movie."
"14276","@ZacharyLevi If Matt was Superman to your Shazam that would be amazing."
"14277","@ZacharyLevi That is too cute. Halloween is going to be filled with little Shazam’s running all over the place."
"14278","@ZacharyLevi I would love to see a Shazam and Wonder Woman movie. It would be epic."
"14279","@ZacharyLevi I work at a trampoline park and these boys came up to our slide yesterday to do ""Shazam moves"" as they flew into the foam pit."
"14280","do y’all think it’s ok for me to edit shazam ?? i have the entire movie saved and i wanna edit freddy but i don’t want wb to be angry"
"14281","@BVP_23 Shazam has the advantage of sticking the landing in an awesome third act."
"14282","@BVP_23 Last act of Wonder Woman threw out the message of the film. Shazam’s follows through with its message and has a great surprise with the Batson Family."
"14283","@ZacharyLevi you absolutely killed it as Shazam. Aside from the first trailer I went into it almost blind and what happened in the final act, figured that would be reserved for a sequel. Excited to see what’s next! Congrats!"
"14284","And so my 6 and 3/4 little guy is now obsessed with #Shazam and has decided .. he is saving up his pocket money for a @ZacharyLevi Shazam Thunder Punch <U+0001F91B> action figure and He needs the costume too .. <U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FB><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F> you’re his new hero Zach"

"14287","@ZacharyLevi Just got home from Shazam and have to say it was a great movie!!! My family said it was the best movie they ever seen <U+0001F441>"
"14288","@ZacharyLevi I just got home from Shazam and it was such a great movie! I definitely teared up more than once! <U+0001F602>"
"14289","Shazam is a really good movie and I recommend you watch it."
"14290","Ok Shazam is actually pretty good"
"14291","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie We love a supportive queen. Welcome to the dceu @ZacharyLevi. Shazam really is amazing"
"14292","Loved this film!! It was so much fun!!
<U+26A1><U+FE0F>#Shazam! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>
Can’t wait to see the whole DC team together!!"
"14293","@GeekGumptionVF @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Better come sooner than later I tell you."
"14294","@ZacharyLevi I completely understand Louie. I also have depression and  when it's bad Chuck is my go to, I even have it downloaded on my phone. Seeing Shazam I now have another go to. Thank you and God bless you!!!!"
"14295","@AmazonChique @boymonster Shazam had a lot less expectations to live up to (and two fewer prior movies)."
"14296","@ZacharyLevi okay I'm pointing out i loved shazam it's one of my fav dc super hero film even with all the references to other dc heroes in it so much fun, u were made to play the role of SHAZAM! ~The Docor"
"14297","@ZacharyLevi okay I'm pointing out i loved shazam it's one of my fav dc super hero film even with all the references to other dc heroes in it so much fun, u were made to play the role of SHAZAM! Sorry retweet ~The Doctor"
"14298","Shazam with the big bro @SimonEspinoza1"
"14299","Shazam! is really charming! This film leans into having a Chosen Family. It has serious Big vibes which is a given. At times, it hits you over the head with the DCEU references. Overall a good addition to the franchise."
"14300","Loved #chuck and love #ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi"
"14301","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @GalGadot Haha I remember your line in Justice League:

""Children. I work with children.""

Now you can actually say that you are working with a child if ever there is a crossover in the works. :D"
"14302","@ZacharyLevi I just came out from the cinema and #Shazam was perfect! I love it with all my hearth! Even my mom who doesn't care about superheros loved you and love the movie, You and everyone in the cast and crew deserve all the success! Congrats!!!!"
"14303","DC actually DID THAT. #SHAZAM"
"14304","Just got back home after watching both #Shazam and #CaptainMavel and they were both good films. I really hope DC continues this trend of solid contained films. Also not understanding the Brie Larson hate in CapMarvel. I thought she was great."
"14305","the only thing keeping me going is that I’m gonna watch shazam next weekend and I’m really excited for it"
"14306","I was really expecting shazam to the the antman of DC pero it was actually pretty good"
"14307","@ZacharyLevi He needs to be in Shazam 2 if there’s one! Bryce and Chuck together again!"
"14308","@Beth_Reader @ZacharyLevi The Shazam off the roof &gt; any superhero landing. Sorry @VancityReynolds"
"14309","Golly, maybe @DCComics can have nice things after all!  Thank you not ruining my favorite character &amp; restoring my hope in the movies.  #SHAZAM!  
 <U+0001F495><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14310","@Cassius335 @AmazonChique I call BS on that. Shazam had a whole raft of DC movies before it that were critical failures apart from Wonder Woman, so it was on shaky ground to begin with."
"14311","Just saw @ShazamMovie and I would definitely rate it a 10/10 best DC movie."
"14312","#Shazam movie was so awesome I want to watch it again omg<U+0001F60D><U+2764><U+0001F60D>"
"14313","This was the man that drew the New 52 origin of Shazam comic back in 2011, I think. Over 150 pages . If Gary Frank says Shazam movie was. Then it was good and all these bad ratings don’t count"
"14314","I finally got to watch Shazam! last night and I just have to say @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher and everyone that helped make this movie, thank you so much, for bringing my favourite superhero of all time to the big screen. I love this movie so much <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14315","I will say: I went into #Shazam knowing absolutely *nothing* about it (it's in the DCEU, I guess?), and I really, truly fell in love with it. @ZacharyLevi, Jack Grazer, and Asher Angel are all great and have wonderful camaraderie. And NOBODY TOLD ME Mark Strong was in it!!"
"14316","I left the movie theater feeling completely prouder of you and an unexplainable peace inside. Congratulations, my hero from much before Shazam. Any signs of #Shazam 2 ? @ZacharyLevi"
"14317","It would be fantastic if my husband could yell @Shazam and turn into Zachary Levi#Chuckgrewup!@ZacharyLevi"
"14318","Shazam was charming as shit. The villain and action were weak, but it's clear that wasn't the main focus. It was about Billy growing and learning to accept his family. It's a character focused coming of age film, and it does that well."
"14319","freddy <U+0001F499><U+0001F4AB>: superheroes are his escape, disabled and feels completely forgotten and isolated
me: superheroes are my escape, has a disability and feels completely forgotten and isolated

freddy is the <U+0001F493>heart of shazam and i have never watched a character portrayed so amazingly"
"14320","Easily  RT @_vidabella: Shazam was super cute .. definitely the best of the DC movies"
"14321","@DCComics @ShazamMovie I loved this movie, it is the perfect encapsulation of what I imagined a Captain Marvel (Shazam) movie could be; he's my fav DC hero after Batman."
"14322","Just got out of Shazam now time to get home for #WrestleMania"
"14323","@RichardEpcar @2ne1problems ....could Raiden redirect the Shazam lightning bolt I wonder?"
"14324","Damn that’s a no go in Shazam then"
"14325","time to"
"14326","Just watched ‘Shazam!’ &amp; I thought it was really great <U+0001F44D> probably the most fun I had watching a DC comic book movie. It actually felt like a superhero, it was fun, it was corny &amp; the effects didn’t hurt my eyes"
"14327","who wants to watch Shazam w me rn"
"14328","#ShazamMovie <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE> go see it. @DCComics hot right now"
"14329","Might go out and see Shazam tomorrow."
"14330","So Shazam was okay. Freddy reminded me of Mishima P5 and also he is my son now"
"14331","Shazam! review: you guys should follow me on Instagram @papilomeli it offers pretty decent content once in awhile. Just like this movie. 5/10"
"14332","Or it is that Hoseok makes everything look good. cus we can't pull some of his fits without looking like the uncaped version of the superhero Shazam with Balenciagas"
"14333","@michaelalfox Also, I just got out of Shazam! and uh, the main character looks almost exactly like you. It's freakin uncanny."
"14334","@michaelalfox No joke, the whole time I was thinking that Shazam! is really just a reboot of Dragonslayer Doppleganger. @michaelalfox @NorthernlionLP"
"14335","@ZacharyLevi thanks for making the most enjoyable DC film I’ve ever seen! The whole #Shazam cast and crew are awesome!"
"14336","@Only_Grey I certainly can and will agree with you on that topic. But let's be consistent with this one. A lot of CBMs have superheroes doing something other than superheroing. That's pretty fine if done good or when we're dealing with origin stories. Shazam is both, IMO."
"14337","@gratefulmaggzzz They're different I agree but I ate 70% of this bag during Shazam! Yesterday and I'm still alive"
"14338","Brock is trying to make that 8 o'clock showing of shazam. I can dig it lol#WrestleMania35"
"14339","@hqtrivia #marvelgamenight, Eric from Volo, IL.  And favorite superhero?  SHAZAM!!!  GREAT movie!"
"14340","Seeing everyone love #Shazam and Zachary Levi as much as I do, gives me butterflies <U+0001F917><U+0001F98B>"
"14341","The Rock produced Shazam! (The movie) wow."
"14342","Shazam is probably my favorite DC movie. Had no real expectations but overall it was a dope movie! #Shazam"
"14343","@superrino12 I like Zachary Levi as Shazam though I understand when you’re 15 year old kid and transforming into Shazam you will like act like a child and being so clumsy at times.Maybe in the next movie they will make Shazam mature and will be more confident at times."
"14344","@superrino12 I like Zachary Levi as Shazam though I understand when you’re 15 year old kid and transforming into Shazam you will like a child and being clumsy."
"14345","Tbh felt a bit low with my self-esteem and my recent breakup wasn't helping. But seeing one of my eternal faves @ZacharyLevi killing it on Shazam! made me so proud and happy! Stay being you, Zac!"
"14346","About to watch Shazam y'all fuck with it ?"
"14347",";; seeing shazam, i’ll be active after ! #bearthur"
"14348","which movie should I watch later? Shazam!, Eerie, or Captain Marvel? @SM_Cinema <U+0001F60A>"
"14349","Wow #Shazam is amazing!!! It's got it all heart, humor and heroics!"
"14350","im so fucking excited bro i love shazam"
"14351","With all the darkness in we live in right now, it's kind of cool that there are two great Captain Marvel movies with heart out right now. Shazam is sweet and fun, and Captain Marvel is awesome!! :)"
"14352","I saw the Endgame trailer (<U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>) before Shazam! today, which is DC. Is that allowed?"
"14353","I went into #Shazam thinking it could turn the tides for @DCComics movies. But I was wrong. 

IMO it suffers from poor CGI for the villains, poor continuity and what many superhero movies suffer from at first: inconsistent awareness of powers. 

Don't @ me"
"14354","Finally about to see Shazam."
"14355","I cant be the only one that was secretly hoping that @ZacharyLevi would say ""guys, I know Kung Fu!"" When he first turns into Shazam right? <U+0001F602>"
"14356","Oh no, I suck! I should have said ""So I loved #SHAZAM"""
"14357","Absolutely loved Shazam! @ZacharyLevi has been one of our family’s favorites for a long time!"
"14358","@ZacharyLevi Holy crap! Thanks Zachary! He wore the Billy Batson hat, hoodie, and coat to the movie Friday afternoon and begged me to make the Shazam costume as soon as the lights came up in the theater afterward. 19 hours later and he’s the happiest boy on earth. You’re the man!"
"14359","i would DIE for Freddy Freeman in Shazam without hesitation"
"14360","@LouieGreen4 I also suffer severe depression . I’ve been needing a reason to go out thanks for the Shazam recommendation"
"14361","@Justin_Buschman I’m so happy Warner Brothers waited for the AQUAMAN AND SHAZAM movies to get their shit together. Not, idk, Superman, Batman, and the Justice League"
"14362","without me"
"14363","The ""fans"" create divisions, I LOVE that the studios don't. In my (limited) experience with the bts peeps on both sides. They are by and far non competitive, friendly people who build each other up."
"14364","Damn I offered to pay for everyones tickets to go watch Shazam and they all tell me no. Im hurt"
"14365","Just imagine: Shazam &amp; Superman: The Return Of Black Adam....

End of the Act One battle between our heroes and Teth: Billy's foster parents get caught in the crossfire.

Billy, broken by the price paid...comes clean:

#Shazam
#ShazamMovie
#HenryCavillIsOurSuperman
#DeusVult"
"14366","So Twitter took the lightning bolt away from #Shazam and #ShazamMovie ...the weekend of the wide release.

...

You got something to say about this, Dorsey?"
"14367","@ZacharyLevi ive also been suffering from depression for years. ive seen shazam three times now and it just makes me feel so... happy. it makes me feel like a kid again. im glad this movie brings joy to a lot of people as it does to me. i love this movie."
"14368","Just saw Shazam!  So excited to hear @twentyonepilots on the soundtrack!  <U+0001F60E>"
"14369","@Steele131 @TheFliteCast Shazam has to earn it's money as fast as it can cause after 25th this it won't get another chance"
"14370","i wanna go watch Shazam or Five Feet Apart but all my friends are studying tonight...

I know there’s no shame in going to the movies on my own but I honestly feel kind of lame"
"14371","so your telling me there’s still a chance henry is staying???"
"14372","If you’re ever in a really crowded place, just randomly shout Shazam!! And see what everyone’s reaction is. Most are going to either jump out of their skin, or run."
"14373","We saw #shazam earlier today, and there's one question that is still bothering me.  Who owns the rights to Batman and Superman inside the movie universe?"
"14374","@RegalMovies My son would love this, he absolutely loved the movie!! @Nerd4Sale  #Shazam #RegalChoosesYou"
"14375","Dawg I am crying right now because
These damn marvel fans at it again <U+0001F602>"
"14376","The dog dies in the end"
"14377","Shazam was great fun. I was just desperate for the credits by the beginning of the third act because I needed to pee so fucking bad.

Giant cup of coffee followed by a heavily discounted large drink. Like two cycles of people came and went while I was using the restroom after."
"14378","Bunch of fucking boring parents are still hanging out in the lobby talking about how crazy some of the adult-oriented references were in Shazam.

Your kids will be okay after seeing some big dumb cg monsters eat people and hearing a few bad words."
"14379","@noobde Ed! I just finished watching Shazam in the theaters! It was an amazing movie! Is there anything that could be done about Shazam being in Injustice 2! Any glimmer of hope?"
"14380","@Browntable_Ent They have so much potential! If the keep making movies like Shazam and Aquaman marvel may actually have some competition. Which will give us better films from both companies"
"14381","Just got out of #Shazam and my first thought was-""y'all ever found-family trope just to flex on marvel?"""
"14382","@UberKryptonian Cavill and levi teaming up? That's badass. Have the MoS theme and shazam theme in the movie and it's even better"
"14383","The tone in shazam was cool. With the civilians liking him but it would be interesting if a tragic event happened in a sequel causing half of the people to hate him and the other half to still trust him. Similar to MoS."
"14384","@screenrant Shazam brings new life into the DCEU! Black Adam, Mr. Mind and now these Crocodile Men? Bring on the sequels!"
"14385","@ZacharyLevi going to see #Shazam on holiday in South Korea! very excited to see it so can't wait til we get home!"
"14386","Only criticism of an otherwise awesome movie"
"14387","Went and seen @ShazamMovie (aka #TheRealCaptainMarvel ) with my son today.  Great movie.  We both fully enjoyed it.  Really appreciated that it didn't try to make political statements."
"14388","@Boibluu1 @Nation__7 Yeah I don’t think any other franchise has made that much in their first 7 movies. I mean Shazam hasn’t even started yet. It’s going to 5.5 Billion."
"14389","I’m so glad Shazam/billy has entered the dceu and I’m super pumped to see what’s next for them"
"14390","shazam is probably one of my favourite heroes now even though I haven’t read a single comic!! I may be going to a comic store soon tho so it’s <U+0001F44C>"
"14391","Shazam was literally so good I can’t stop thinking of it!!!! The power of one (1) word! Gives me CHILLS! and I never saw THAT scene coming..."
"14392","Fucking beautiful. My heart is filled with happinesses and bursting with joy! Loved it from the start to the last second! #SHAZAM <U+0001F499><U+0001F499><U+0001F499>"
"14393","Came to watch Shazam by myself. In imax too. Large popcorn and Mr. Pibb!"
"14394","@ZacharyLevi how does it feel that your some kids favorite superhero now? 

Next time a kid is going to say they’re shazam when they are pretending to be heroes. 

That has to feel pretty bad ass."
"14395","@ZacharyLevi took in a little something called Shazam! They could not have picked a better person for this gem. Loved it!"
"14396","@ErnieMac10 Need to hear your thoughts on Shazam and US."
"14397","y’all should download shazam and stream #KILLTHISLOVE"
"14398","@Dolarpo I liked #Shazam for what it was... a fun movie about a kid suddenly blessed with Superpowers, it doesnt take itself too serious and its pretty funny. The CGI in some scenes seem unprofessional sometimes but they make up for it with how funny the situations and characters are."
"14399","Wtf shazam already came out <U+0001F62D> idk if I should see it today or Tuesday"
"14400","Imma try and see this movie on Tuesday:)"
"14401","@GalGadot @TheMarySue @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Now bring on the next Justice League movie for this magic..."
"14402","Saw #Shazam , laughed a lot, really recommend it. But like always happens, GF and I had to endure two blessings in the front row: one girl that shook her head all the time, like a Stevie Wonder impersonation, and another that made IG stories ALL THE FUCKING TIME."
"14403","I'll be watching Shazam tomorrow since it's holiday haha. No dutyyyyy!!!"
"14404","@ZacharyLevi One of my favorite things about #Shazam being out now is that we get to watch tons of interviews of you. This may sound super corny, but you are a delight to watch. Can't help but be happy when you're geeking out over the movie and the fact that you're in it."
"14405","@Iokified ur literally why i’d go and see shazam btw just letting u know lol, why haven’t they paid u to promote them????"
"14406","@Niaa_x Wanted to watch Shazam today but #laziness. Us was TRASSSSHHHH"
"14407","Haven’t seen Shazam but hope to next weekend. Captain America movies might have something to do with the writers and @Russo_Brothers as I’ve been watching the trilogy this weekend preparing for #Endgame"
"14408","Man they really need to work on their cgi. Seven deadly sins damn near looked like the monsters from that live action Scooby-Doo movie"
"14409","@MattBHafen @wolf9walker @ShazamMovie The Wisdom of Solomon is pretty much saying he has the potential to find the answers from within him. In the Comics and the animated films he is not all knowing, he needs context!

He is not like Dr. Fate’s helmet who can transfer his knowledge to the host."
"14410","@ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi <U+26A1><U+FE0F>Shazam!<U+26A1><U+FE0F> <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC> More Horror directors need to tackle superhero movies. Genuinely heart warming, funny, some truly scary moments, and totally badass from start to finish. Easily restored my faith in the DCEU!"
"14411","@smugorange I've been sad all week thinking about no @WalkingDead_AMC tonight but then I left the theatre with a big smile after seeing you in #Shazam this afternoon <U+0001F601>"
"14412","My bestie would have the ability of mind reading... They always know my thoughts <U+0001F62E>"
"14413","what it deserves"
"14414","shazam was such a fun experience. never thought i would be this pumped for a DC movie."
"14415","Seeing Shazam with @_Qapla was the best decision cause she laughed for a minute straight after one joke"
"14416","""The movie is called Shazam!"" 

Okay, but I will continue to call the character in which the movie is loosely based on Captain Marvel."
"14417","I loved Shazam so much that I'd go so far as to say: if this represents the new era of DCEU films, than they may just finally be ready to take on the MCU toe-to-toe. It's that great!"
"14418","@RichardDawkins Why not play it and use  Shazam app to identify it <U+0001F60E>"
"14419","Before Shazam! I finished the first Borderlands 1 DLC and started the third (Skiped the Moxxi one since it's a horde mode) and after that's done it's onto the 4th and final one. Then next on the agenda is starting Presequel and continuing Trails of Cold Steel by alternating days."
"14420","i handed out w my twin and we watched shazam <U+0001F614><U+270A>"
"14421","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie can u tell henry to post his congratulations already we’re stoked to see what he’s come up with"
"14422","@dk_munro  SHAZAM ..great family movie."
"14423","I might have to go just to see Faithe."

April is too good to me <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"14425","#ShazamMovie was meh. Like #Aquaman it knew exactly what type of film it was but I couldn’t fully dig it.  Fight scenes/ visuals were very “superhero-y” &amp; bleh. Funny moments in film were genuine &amp; natural, &amp; Zachary Levi was good but overall film was not that great. 5.3/10"
"14426","Couldn’t you technically have a crossover with him since you’re Negative man?"
"14427","Love this"
"14428","There’s a Shazam! Movie. Once again, 4 year old me is delighted. Make them all."
"14429","Someone PLEASE go with this man to the movies, any of the 50 people in Maine please"
"14430","My sleep schedule is all messed up again, so I had to skip seeing Shazam today. Hope I can find the time to see it sometime in the next week."
"14431","But, let me be clear. I love all these characters. An awesome history. No strife from me. Shazam<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14432","I just reread @geoffjohns and @1moreGaryFrank's New 52 reboot of #Shazam and yes, HUGE influence on the movie. A lot of scenes taken directly from it.

I miss mad scientist Sivana, but I get why they changed it in New 52"
"14433","@ZacharyLevi i totally loved Shazam! The story,the cast, YOUR ACTING!! You really make magic everytime you act! Love you Shazam! <U+0001F970><U+270C><U+FE0F>"
"14434","“But you liked Wonder Woman!”

Liking that was an obligation. Shazam was the first time a DC film was *fun* and didn’t have to leverage hope as an emotional fulcrum."
"14435","Shazam...

First DC movie that hasn’t sucked since Burton was making Batman films. (No, I’ve not seen Aquaman yet)

So next film...Tawky Tawny, right? ;)"
"14436","Sponsors need to understand that race fans are extremely brand loyal and will buy products, or in this case watch a film, simply because they are supporting NASCAR

Real stat: 70% of racing fans admit to buying a product just because it was on a car"
"14437","y'know, I saw some people complain about Shazam flossing and i have to ask

what did you expect?
the character is literally a child of course he would do that"
"14438","Shazam was very fun especially the dancing gingerbread costume"
"14439","@ShazamMovie I loved this movie so much. I can’t wait to watch it over and over"
"14440","@AqeelDC This is a HARD question to answer. Well, I haven't seen Shazam yet... so I'm going to say:
MOS
AQM-WW
SHZ (?)"
"14441","@Chris_Stevens77 Ohhhh boy. I cannot wait!!!
My older son is at a school trip so I'm going to wait for him to return.
I had two movies that I cannot wait to see: Shazam and Godzilla King of Monsters."

I have to say though that this is an inspiring casting and I'm sure that if it happens, he will do a great job."
"14443","Shazam was pretty good, still think the concept is super dumb but it was good."
"14444","These covers bring me such joy. LOOK AT MARY!"
"14445","Loved that the villain of Shazam is the seven deadly sins. High time we had a superhero movie for Catholics."
"14446","Finally got the chance to watch Shazam! What a great movie, it has a good storyline, good music, great acting and very good casting. Congrats to the cast of @ShazamMovie

"14447","I've seen it twice, now, and feel the same."
"14448","I missed our 30th anniversary high school reunion, only because it’s set last Sunday. I skipped having spent the weekend with kids, puppers, Mexican dinner, Shazam lfs, Spider-verse on usb, and zeroing laundry."
"14449","Well I guess I'm going to see shazam"
"14450","Saw shazam and had a damn good time. Highly recommend. There was a fewwwwwww specific dumb moments but otherwise loved it."
"14451","Shazam’s ending is so perfect"
"14452","It’s always go watch this and never come watch this with me"
"14453","@AdeelofSteel I was disappointed. DC Comics continues their approach with making a mockery of Shazam. A ""teenager"" in an adult body-BULLSHIT !!! The powers/characteristics of 6 Greek deities and the silver-screen insult is behaving like comic-relief !?"
"14454","@SOVIETASHA you’re so pr*tty you remind me of mary from shazam"
"14455","I am here to Rave about Shazam. Pls go watch it DC did something very right with this movie!!!! It’s awesome and wholesome and I loved it so much!!"
"14456","I never watched a hero movie that gave the audience so much space to interact with the scenes like Shazam!, yes, still shocked."
"14457","Shazam! is my new favorite DCU movie, basically an outright comedy that really works."
"14458","Just remembered that I still haven't seen Justice League vs. The Fatal Five yet. I’ll probably watch it tomorrow after I also see Shazam! in theaters."
"14459","Shazam needs to be the blueprint for every other DC film coming out."
"14460","Oml we watched shazam and the whole time my mom thought it was a marvel movie and at the end she said: “dn dun tanday iron man hay?” HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH DPOTA I CANT"
"14461","DC's definitely going in the right direction. Shazam was awesome."
"14462","Shazam was everything I could have hoped for and more. Like Aquaman they dove head first into the rich history and mythos not apologizing for any of it. Most joy I’ve seen out of a comic book movie in ages and I can’t wait to see it again. #Shazam"
"14463","@kirkneverdied I've only seen four new releases this year. I'd say Shazam &amp; Us were the really good ones. Captain Marvel &amp; Triple Frontier not so much. Not exactly bad, but not great either."
"14464","@ZacharyLevi absolutely killed it as #Shazam. Probably my most favourite DC movie to date."
"14465","#Shazam with my son today. Let me tell you it’s best DC movie in a Long time. #Marvel still rules though."
"14466","@spideymemoir Captain Marvel was always a bland name for a character so steeped in magic and awe. Shazam though? That's great. On the other hand CM perfectly fits a dedicated soldier in the military."
"14467","@spideymemoir I saw Captain Marvel and dug it. Seeing Shazam tuesday and expect the same."
"14468","Weird, but I actually enjoyed #Shazam a whole lot more on my second viewing, compared to my first."
"14469","I’ve decided to buckle down and watch Shazam, thanks YMS"
"14470","OMG they used (spoiler) oooooo"
"14471","I'm going to movies alone to watch shazam  because I can't stop thinking about popcorn."
"14472","I saw Shazam, and I think the DC Universe is finally starting to figure out what fun looks like."
"14473","My birthday was last Friday and to celebrate we went to see 
#Shazam and I wanted to see the post credits scenes and my friend and his sister be like: no way, and they left me alone in the movie theater, and we didn't celebrate my birthday, any words to cheer up @ZacharyLevi ?"
"14474","@ZacharyLevi dude... i just found out that you where in the Marvelous Mrs Maisel... i didn’t recognise you! I discovered you thanks to tangled, and i fell in love with your voice! You literally blew my mind in Shazam... Best movie of 2019<U+0001F929><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14475","I keep seeing people bashing Shazam, and I totally do not understand it at all?! It was a pretty decent movie."
"14476","only February 2018 niggas will get this"
"14477","I just......wanna have the funds to take all my friends out to see Shazam........."
"14478","@trilliaventuras just got out of pet sematary going to the drive in for Shazam. How was that movie by the way? Did you stay for both credit scenes"
"14479","Nobody:

"14480","#Shazam was a really good and funny movie. I like the new direction the DCU is heading with their movies."
"14481","The Shazam! movie is amazing go see it."
"14482","so so sad because if shazam (person) wants to talk about seeing shazam (movie), every time they say shazam (movie), they will turn into shazam (person) :( :( :("
"14483","#Shazam was very cute but the most memorable moment was when a subway car gets hijacked and, in the silence before it spits the lead into a magic cave, a child loudly moaned, “I don’t like this movie!!!”"
"14484","I watched Shazam on Friday with my girlfriend. Loved the movie: intimate, enjoyable and fun! Thank you, DC! #SHAZAM #ShazamFilme"
"14485","It's good to be the youngest in the family yes. My brother carrying me to watch Shazam"
"14486","@danbenjamin I only remember the early 70s Shazam. Loved it. Can’t wait to see the new one."
"14487","After seeing @ShazamMovie at @AMCTheatres @IMAX today. Bring on @Avengers @AMCTheatres @IMAX #AvengersEndgame #WhateverItTakes I got my ticket. How about you?"
"14488","@johnnyjl96 @Nation__7 Damn it was a joke but look at the time frame these movies came out in after another franchise *cough* paved the way and made superhero movies popular to where the dceu can get to this point now (no shade at all because I saw Shazam twice and aquaman 7 times)"
"14489","I am still in utter fucking disbelief that of all the movies YMS gave higher than a 6 or 5/10, it was a DC Superhero Movie, of all things.

I guess I need to see Shazam then."
"14490","@Aric_Almirola @ShazamMovie @SmithfieldBrand @FordPerformance @StewartHaasRcng The reason the seats aren’t full is because of crap like what happened to you today.  That just sucked!"
"14491","I’m going to say it again.....

Shazam was a great movie. 
The trailer did it no justice AT ALL. I was expecting it to be another corny, bad DC movie but it wasn’t. <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>"
"14492","I'm probably going to spend the rest of my life arguing about Black Adam with bland white dudes who've only seen Superman/Shazam"

"14495","Spent my Sunday watching @jackdgrazer  @AsherAngel and @ZacharyLevi in #Shazam and I was definitely not disappointed! Shazam was GREAT!! Easily my favorite DC movie. Though I do have one question: Zachary, how did you keep your cape so white and clean?! <U+2764><U+26A1>"
"14496","@DCComics marketed @ShazamMovie as a funny kid-friendly-super-hero film.  It wasn’t.  Why all the cuss words?  What do u get out of scandalizing kids? A scary movie with satanic-looking creatures. Parents, don’t take your children. @CommonSense #ShazamMovie"

"14498","Shazam! is actually good! Like REALLY good! Go and see it."
"14499","Ghostbusters had a total budget (production + marketing) around $250-$300 million. It only grossed $229m worldwide. So yes, it was a complete flop. 

Shazam! has a total budget of probably $200m and has (already) grossed $160m+. So yes, it should be celebrated as a success."
"14500","Shazam had no business being as good as it is but here we are"

"14502","@GalGadot @momoaloki @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie this is too cute <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"14503","i’m in the theatre about to see shazam but i’m stressed about some other stuff"
"14504","The more I think about it, #Shazam might be the most faithful adaptation of the source material. And Zachary Levi is Michael-Keaton caliber as far as surprise casting. He is to Shazam what Keaton was to Batman."
"14505","Shazam movie was so much fun! Congratulations to the cast and crew. So excited to see Michelle Borth.  Love her!!"
"14506","Shazam! is a great movie. Might be a bit better than Wonder Woman (though the special effects may have been slightly worse). Only one plot hole that I saw, and it was just a small, unimportant writing thing. Comedy was on-point throughout the film. Also, legit surprising climax!"
"14507","Thomas gets to stay up late as I was lax at looking at showtimes for shazam! which meant we had to rush out the door. The lyft driver is amused as thomas says how soft and gigantic and perfect my tummy is as a pillow. I guess dad bod pays off in some way. — watching Shazam! Movie"
"14508","people be switching up faster than you can say SHAZAM"

"14510","Shazam was pretty great. Loved how they brought in the Marvel Family, and even more excited for Mister Mind. Now, all we need is Sivana to throw down some scientific formulas, and open a path through the fourth dimension."
"14511","Saw #ShazamMovie today.  It was great!
@ZacharyLevi killed it!
Also the whole supporting cast was amazing as well, which is super important in a movie like this."
"14512","@NickMenakos Shazam might have cost evel less,with a 80M production budget I doubt they spent more than 50M marketing it. So this hall comparison is pure nonsense."
"14513","they didnt want to pay him so he didnt do it. Totally fine with his decision tbh"
"14514","my family saw shazam today and i kind of regret not going w them but..too late now"
"14515","@shurato2099 @DCComics @ShazamMovie It's a generational shift. The generation of comic book writers in the DC stable who felt a compelling, emotional need to atone for the Adam West 'Batman' TV series back in the 60s &amp; to show that post-Comics Code superhero stories could be adult have passed on to retirement"
"14516","Ok...

1 - #Shazam really was a great movie!! So many “ok, but in real life” moments happened where they addressed the outlandishness of superhero movies!

2- why was I sleeping on #JackRyan?! This show is AMAZING!"
"14517","Y'know that scene in every superhero movie where the costume is finally revealed and it does that slow motion zoom to hype you up? Shazam is two hours of that."
"14518","Shazam is a shite film and nobody has the balls to say it."
"14519","@DCComics @ShazamMovie Incredibly entertaining! #ZacharyLevi did a great job of balancing teen angst,humor and youthful exuberance in his performance! @ShazamMovie is like a Superhero version of #Big"
"14520","@ZacharyLevi awesome portrail of #Shazam dude, thank you very much and see you on the next"
"14521","Shazam! .... woah..... haven't had so much fun at the cinema since mamma mia! here we go again"

"14528","After watching #SHAZAM I have one question;
Is Black Adams canon transformation phrase still “Chocolate egg cream”?"

"14531","#shazam 
2019: Finally the year that DC made a better film than Marvel. Not perfect by any means, but vastly more entertaining than the OTHER Captain Marvel. Mark Strong is now the best villain in the DCUniverse. Language is a bit too salty for a kids film"
"14532","@garethlpowell Watch Shazam and loved it."
"14533","Shazam was the best. I felt for all the characters, laughed at the right times and was impressed by the story. No superhero movie has done that for me since, The Dark Knight.

i love Zachary Levi sm

"14536","@redrabbu #Shazam was awesome and very funny as well. And getting excited for part 2 lol"
"14537","@empiremagazine @jamescdyer #empirepodcast primary criticism by my 6 &amp; 8 year olds was disconnect between Batson and Shazam, having prescreened it I was concerned about tone of board room scene etc but they didn't even pause popcorn consumption, they were all in for sweary Santa"
"14538","@Aric_Almirola @ShazamMovie @SmithfieldBrand @FordPerformance @StewartHaasRcng Yep, turned it off after your exit."
"14539","Just got out of Shazam and honestly loved it so much. Probably my favorite movie I’ve seen this year. Everyone should go see it!"
"14540",".@ZacharyLevi #ShazamMovie was the most fun I have had at the movies in a LONG time!!! Thank you for making a great film and showing that family is what you make it"
"14541",".@ZacharyLevi loved you in Shazam!  You did the role Justice!"
"14542","Just getting outta Shazam and gotta day Final fight was pretty awesome!"
"14543","There’s a Twenty One Pilots song in the Shazam movie! I screamed."
"14544","I didn't get to see #ShazamMovie this weekend because I was traveling but it is high on my To Do list for next weekend. And it's nice to see actors in the DC films get in on a little of that in-universe solidarity. :)"
"14545","@ShinGokaiRed @kungfuman316 Shazam! proves WB could've made a traditional Superman movie and it could've worked. They never had to be like The Dark Knight trilogy and be dark and ""realistic"". They just had to make good movies."
"14546","Shazam! Was amazing. 
Hopefully this is the beginning to better DC movies. 
I’m tired of Marvel."
"14547","@AnthDougherty To be fair, it was only part of the day for us. They saw Shazam today and I got my nails done. So I can only half relate."
"14548","@ArtbyAthena1 @TheRogueFangirl ""Couldn't call the COMIC"" Captain Marvel. Open the comic, they call him Captain Marvel. Also those 70s Shazam stories are fun. Art is fantastic too."
"14549","@Fishbowl_Film @martynozz @MakeMineAmalgam Then DC got the character later but by new their legal assholery had come back to bite them in the ass. They called him Cap Marvel IN the book, but ""Shazam"" as the title of the book but they considered that too confusing for lay audiences so in 2011 they just made his name Shazam"
"14550","@MetallicaTalk Agreed. And I could totally buy a Shazam movie figure. And I might still. But that classic look is my favorite. Replacements ain't cheap though for DCUC Captain Marvel."
"14551","We all went out tonight in #Floripa and watched #Shazammovie it’s funny, we loved it :) @ShazamMovie"
"14552","I'm seeing Shazam next weekend, but for the record I think it should be called Captain Marvel 2: The Hero Formerly Known as Such."
"14553","Hopefully, Shazam will be every kids favorite Christmas movie for years to come."
"14554","I’ve finished the video, but I gotta get the sponsor segment done!

"14558","@SHAAN87989064 @the_snarkmaster @shazamflop it hasnt opened in Japan yet and given the fact no other competition for Shazam will arise for the next 3 weeks until endgame, its not going to be a smashing home run but it will be alright"
"14559","in the bathroom post shazam and an instrumental of somewhere only we know is playing"
"14560","#PetSematary - i’ve never read the book or saw any adaptation before this but i liked this a lot. great pacing and performances. some cheap jump scares but mostly genuine thrills. with this and shazam, it’s a great weekend for the movies!"
"14561","@Bernard52869427 I think they'll stay faithful to his original origin as an Egyptian ruler. It would only be fitting if they stuck with it since that is who he is. Though i kinda feel bad for Black Adam because if he were to say SHAZAM now, he would wither into dust."
"14562","Shazam is pretty fucking good. Maybe DC is finally learning from there mistakes."
"14563","@FreddyInSpace Take Shazam out, put four guys with proton packs in and it's a fucking Ghostbusters movie! <U+0001F601>"
"14564","Finally saw Shazam yesterday with fam and its fucking hilarious light film. NakakaGood vibes siya <U+0001F495> The lightest feel good superhero film I've watched so far."
"14565","Finally got around to watching Aquaman, and I’m happy there’s finally a DCEU film I actually really enjoy. Wonder Woman was fine, but I didn’t love it. Pretty much everything else has been trash, so hopefully Shazam continues the positive trend."
"14566","Great movie!"
"14567","Btw slow hands was in the Shazam movie no wonder I keep hearing it everywhere at the mall and the movie theater For you could never"
"14568","@celebitchy @ShazamMovie I respect your reviews, and will definitely see this!  Thanks CB!  Hope you're feeling better!"
"14569","@CBMHype @UberKryptonian Yeah and Shazam knocks out Superman. This is where Superman learns he's vulnerable against magic."
"14570","Also, if I get this job, I'm going to see Shazam!"
"14571","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Is Shazam! Seriously doing the Dreamworks eyebrow thing?"
"14572","You couldn't have told me Shazam hasn't been in theaters for 3 weeks."
"14573","Not to be extra but Niall playing in the background in one of the Shazam scenes made me silently fangirl in the cinema"
"14574","@brie_sparkles @MakeMineAmalgam Exactly. I've always felt the name Shazam is awesome. Remember one of my first Mego toys, Shazam. This need to refer to this character as Captain Marvel seems silly. Move on."
"14575","I expect Barry’s trail to look 10x better now considering how Shazam’s looked amazing @WBHomeEnt @wbpictures"
"14576","Wishing to be able to be another person by saying their name like Shazam is just like the movie get out."
"14577","Dragging my mom to see Shazam :) excited to watch it again"
"14578","Billy embracing his family and working to embrace others is what mattered, beating the big bads simply happened as an afterthought.
Good job.
#SHAZAM"
"14579","I want to acknowledge how #SHAZAM did right by making sure the kid, Billy wasn't presented as being 'pure' or 'good' as being without fault. He had hangups and issues with abandonment and feeling like he betrayed his Mom if he showed anyone else love"
"14580","@FlaminHotMilf I mean, I consider myself a Marvel fanboy, but even I didn't think Captain Marvel was that good. Hell, I'd be willing to see Shazam"
"14581","@ZacharyLevi #Shazam is a great movie!!! Just saw it this evening and it really is one of the best superhero movies I’ve seen. Really hope to see more of Shazam in the future."
"14582","im very happy rn, i went to see Shazam,, didnt expect to like it very much, but it was actually good. i got to get out of the house for the first time since i moved here, i was excited. spring break was boring, but the end was worth the long wait. i got to take pictures too i-"
"14583","I really liked Shazam. It was nice to see a superhero movie that wasn't trying too hard to be a superhero movie with crazy action. It was a good time"
"14584","Three good things about today: 1. I watched Shazam. It's not the best superhero movie out there, or even the most idiosyncratic (plus, it's easily about 15 minutes too long), but it was fun."
"14585","So it’s finally happening?"
"14586","Okay so first of all: I love my angry bald dad Mark Strong"
"14587","I’m glad Shazam exists bc I finally have a DC movie that actually reflects what I like about DC."
"14588","I cried about 10 times more than I did with Roma holy shit that was phenomenal.. 9/10"
"14589","The Godzilla 5 minute trailer is absolutely godly, my only nitpick is that Ghidorah’s awakening is almost literally exactly like the male Muto’s from 2014 but they’re both really well done, also the shots of the fighting look absolutely gorgeous. Shazam was ok lol"
"14590","James Wan will singlehandedly deliver the DC universe I've needed for the last 20 years. All down to the Annabelle doll in SHAZAM may God bless his soul"
"14591","Went to see Shazam in IMAX with two friends today, really great experience.
Now I feel a bit spoiled, watching movies in IMAX is so much better of an experience than a regular screen."
"14592","@ConradTerminus I believe there was a comic where Superman finds out that Captain Marvel is a kid and goes to Shazam's lair to kick his ass."
"14593","Bruh DC made back to back badass movies with Aquaman and Shazam smh... I’m telling you they’re doing something great here.."
"14594","Saw Shazam and I’m legit surprised how much i enjoyed it. Sincerely so much fun, yet competently made and is something a lot of Marvel films have been lacking for a while. Better Captain Marvel movie."
"14595","Shazam is a really amazing movie!!!! Loved it so much!!!!!!! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F49B><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"14596","That part in Shazam when “Don’t Stop Me Now” came on I was immediately like “UMBRELLA ACADEMY”"
"14597","I think I’m obsessed with Shazam now too OOPS"
"14598","Also I thought Shazam! wouldn’t be so good considering DC’s track record, but no. That ending left me purely satisfied in a “This is exactly what I wanted and I didn’t even know or expect it” kind of way."
"14599","the biggest plot hole of shazam is the part where they bought  alcohol in a philly supermarket instead of a state store"
"14600","That boy from Shazam is really cute omg"
"14601","Shazam is fun and wholesome and cute and INCREDIBLE please go see it

Zachary Levi is as fun as I’d hoped and then some and it’ll be a new Christmas staple for me FOR SURE"
"14602","Just finished watching #Shazam and 3 things are absolutely true: 1. It’s the best Super movie of 2019 so far 2. @ZacharyLevi is everything I never knew I needed and 3. Shazam is a Christmas movie. I will not entertain arguments against the latter"
"14603","I took my father in law to see Shazam today. I sort of enjoyed it. If you want to unfollow me (or deny the fact we ever talked) I totally understand"
"14604","My favorit part of #ShazamMovie was Sinbad's genie character. Very memorable!"
"14605","@Putsky88 That was Saturdays at noon, right? I recall watching Shazam and the female superhero, Isis. Of course, Isis back then was not the Isis of today . . ."
"14606","My son and I enjoyed Shazam this weekend AND Captain Marvel a couple weeks back. Imagine that."
"14607","Just finished seeing #SHAZAM and wow!!!  One of the best superhero movies I’ve seen in a LONG time!"
"14608","@ZacharyLevi Shazam was awsome, just saw it and your where great in it. Hope your doing a second part to it."
"14609","Shazam is really, REALLY well plotted. A lot of credit is being given to how well the core concept is executed, but for me it was all about the subtle things, like Billy's combat tactics and the way the wizard wins as a direct result of his champion-choosing mechanic collapsing."
"14610",".@Alex8Calvert did you watch shazam? it's a really good movie, i think you would like it. take @jenna_berman to the movies with you. have a nice day(<U+2661><U+02D8> <U+1D55> <U+02D8>)"
"14611","@tonyinbloom DCEU is actually looking in better shape with WW, Aquaman, and now Shazam. We'll get a new Batman and Superman and they'll be better connected with how the universe is currently going. Joker is separate from DCEU but will be great"
"14612","• alright xD Amon seems a nice character but he's scary -"
"14613","Shazam is really good and all the child actors do an incredible job! Check it out if you want :0"
"14614","@RealJohnGlover @michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie You were awesome in the film, which I really enjoyed. And my daughter loved it."
"14615","@CelestriJohn I’m reading it in a reprint included in Shazam #13 (1974) so I’m not sure what issue the story was originally published in during the Golden Age."
"14616","@kaiju_kam I need to watch Aquaman actually...but Shazam was a fun and enjoyable ride"
"14617","The Pasifika community needs to watch Shazam and show @smugorange some love! We’ve got a half Samoan brother in the movie!!!"
"14618","So I saw Shazam! last night.
The movie is good, Levi was a great casting choice, the history has two great key points when the entire cinema yelled.
However, I left the cinema with a bitter taste in my mouth. Shame on @wbpictures"
"14619","@MoviesSilently @oldfilmsflicker @SabinaStent Ooph, those prices.  Still, I did like #Shazam so it will entertain..."
"14620","@TheUnrealPeterG @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Yes it would."
"14621","I’m really excited about watching Shazam tomorrow! I really want it to be good cos he’s actually one of my fave ever"
"14622","when you have to shazam songs that everyone sings along too since you don't know them bc you go to art school."
"14623","@kennymc787 That Roma slander <U+0001F629> but I forgive you bc Shazam is great <U+0001F920>"
"14624","@Linkara19 Hey Linkara, I have two questions.  One, do you plan on doing a vlog about Shazam?  And two, if I were to be one of the lucky few to get a Patreon review slot sometime in the future, would doing Jeff Smith's Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil miniseries be feasible?"
"14625","@Lost789Boy @dcumoviepage Yes what about green screen? Ezra's was shot in front of green screen right? And in Shazam it's not a very complicated shot at all. They would have easily nailed it."
"14626","Saw @ShazamMovie and loved it! Good fun, simple story, great message! Nice blend of Big, 80’s movies and  touch of Richard Donner’s Superman! Overall, a great time at the movies."
"14627","Good to see @RealJohnGlover in Shazam today!  Is it DC’s MO to typecast you to be the father of bald super villains?  Just sayin!"
"14628","I was watching Shazam and missed Marvel hq :(((("
"14629","@RealJohnGlover Really enjoyed seeing your performance in #Shazam.  You're the kind of actor that anytime you appear on screen, I get happy to see you.  We need more, nay, we demand more of you!  <U+0001F61C>"
"14630","@RedRipull_RBX @Darkflames1979 I loved brave and the bold but it was a bit too goofy though it introduced me to so many awesome characters. I found out about Shazam/captain marvel because of that show."
"14631","@CaptainApper It is. There are somethings casual fans wouldn’t understand that I loved as well. Shazam nailed it imo, it’s hard to fail when you’re making a superhero comedy that usually works, it reminded me of homecoming, a high school film featuring a superhero."
"14632","Just saw Shazam! I thought the end was dragged out a bit but overall, a really funny and overall p good movie! I’d give it like a 7.5/10 or something like that"
"14633","Man, I really loved #Shazam"
"14634","@HKHIPSTER @AMCTheatres @ShazamMovie @dc @WarnerBrosEnt How is this person filming the ending of the movie not violating pirate laws or copyright infringement? When are people going to let people go to the movies and enjoy the film without spoilers? If I were the accountant or lawyer I'd take legal action."
"14635","Gotta say.... Shazam....

Best DC movie as of late.

Solid movie 

Solid acting

Overall a good decision."
"14636","Now that I’ve watch the movie I can go and watch all the video review of it and all the other thing Shazam related  #Shazam"
"14637","Honestly, I'm really convinced Shazam isn't the best name for him. He can't even introduce himself properly, given how he has to skip his name every time.

""Hi, my name's Sha- umm... Bill-- no, not that... *sigh* Holy moley!"""
"14638","@TalkingDCMarvel Yes. Precisely today I saw Shazam and I kept the ticket! I have a collection basically <U+0001F602>"
"14639","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie The universe? A universe without @BenAffleck, Henry Cavill and Ezra  Miller? Too bad @wbpictures did not have the guts to let what was started to be finished. You know there is something wrong when a studio wants the Flashpoint events to be funny. Oh and #ReleaseTheSnyderCut <U+0001F44A>"
"14640","@kanyedailyquote @Variety I guess so Gal Gadot tweeted him Congratulating him on Shazam"
"14641","Shazam was amazing, I loved everything about it"
"14642","The black foster care girl was definitely the best part of Shazam"
"14643","@pedroangelnsc @AntravisBisou He also doesn’t have to be asked about Batman 1000 times, waste hours on hours working out, stressing out bout pleasing a fan base. Y’all are toxic and make it worse for everyone. 

I’m glad you didn’t watch shazam. No one needs to be around your negativity and sour puss mood"
"14644","At IMAX screening for Shazam.

Got the Godzilla King of the Monsters footage.

Holy.

Fucking.

Shit.

"14648","Shazam had like the most innacurate depiction of Philly ever"
"14649","@jan90067 @ShazamMovie It was a really cute movie they did a great job with it"
"14650","@jan90067 @ShazamMovie I am definitely thanks!"
"14651","I saw Shazam and @ZacharyLevi was just amazing <U+2764>"
"14652","While I’ll forever resent Zack Snyder for setting the precedent that DC movies have to look dark, overcast, and broody, #Shazam finally managed to add some light, color, fun, and heart to a neglected universe and bring a balance. Felt like watching Justice League Unlimited again!"
"14653","Shazam is excellent! Best DC movie by far! If you're into comparing the two it's up there with some of the best of the MCU"
"14654","#SHAZAM is excellent! Best DC movie by far! If you're into comparing the two it's up there with some of the best of the MCU"
"14655","Shazam finally addressed a movie trope that has bothered he hell out of me <U+0001F602>"
"14656","10 year old cousin had to go use the bathroom in the middle of Shazam. This is all the birth control I need."
"14657","I was told by a friend who just saw Shazam, that in the Superman cameo. You can hear the John Williams theme in softly in the background.. If this is true, WB is even worse than I thought and Cavill is out"
"14658","@ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher Nice if they reprinted some of these"
"14659","they already took the emoji off the shazam hashtag who i gotta fight at twitter dot com hq"
"14660","Watched @ShazamMovie today and we are living in the Golden age of comic book movies. So many great movies that we have to enjoy. There shouldn’t be any hate between @dc and @MarvelStudios fans. Just enjoy having so many great films to choose from. @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher"
"14661","why tf ross butler in shazam"
"14662","Going to see Shazam now. I’ll let y’all know the vibe"
"14663","Shazam has just become my 2nd favorite superhero origin story"
"14664","finally a superhero in PHILLY!! @ShazamMovie is definitely the best DC movie if not one of the best SUPERHERO movies ever... @ponysmasher great job on this one!! and @lottalosten great performance as always :)"
"14665","@AmazonChique lol Shazam cost 80-100M, break even will be around 250M, and it will make 150M US (where most profit are made) and 400-500M overall. It has A cinemascore and 90%+ RT as well
Ghostbusters cost 144M and made 229M worldwide, B+ score and RT in 70s. Think about that."

"14669","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover I wonder will SHAZAM be considered a Christmas movie like Die Hard??"
"14670","@ZacharyLevi just saw #Shazam it was amazing especially the fact that the rigging artists got credited as Rigging Best Boys"
"14671","@JillFilipovic Shazam! prominently features a multiracial foster family and I am looking forwards to Takes."
"14672","Gonna go see Shazam in like an hour. Really excited"
"14673","@Jessizord @EthanVanSciver War Campaign should all group up and see Shazam together! <U+0001F601>"
"14674","@CraigHarris456 All these clowns said they were going to see Shazam to protest Captain Marvel lmao."
"14675","what failures other than JL? this argument is so dumb lmfao."
"14676","I haven't seen the footage yet, but... I need this movie injected into my bloodstream this instant"
"14677","Perks of watching it the second time is watching the audience freak out at the end scene <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> #Shazam"
"14678","Just watched #Shazam for the second time <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FE> this is that movie, everyone should get a group of friends and family and check this out, tons of humor, heart, and joy"
"14679","I’m all for this idea but I just love how Warner Bros picks and chooses which actor’s ideas they wanna listen too. They’ll listen to the Rock but not Ezra Miller or Henry Cavil <U+0001F644><U+0001F644>"
"14680","Just watched shazam! I dont even know what to say. The movie was horrible. Worse than justice league. I would rather watch superman returns than this crap. It's like this movie is the complete opposite of Zacks Vision. I'm disgusted"
"14681","Okay, calling it. I had 0 interest in #Shazam when I saw the trailer. I have no familiarity with the comics. I was gonna let it slide by, but people I trust said it was good, and it’s turned out to be one of my favourite superhero movies. This is why you keep an open mind in life"
"14682","I give Shazam an “Ah my ankles” /10, but actually it was super good definitely the best DC hero movie in a while, Solid 7/10"
"14683","@Releasethexmen @DCComics @ShazamMovie When I saw Superman, I was very excited with the friends who watched the movie together."
"14684","@DCComics @ShazamMovie When I saw Superman, I was very excited with the friends who watched the movie together. Superman, superman<U+0001F602>"
"14685","Everyone actor was great, but Jack Dylan Grazer (Freddy) probably had the best performance in Shazam."
"14686","And for the rest of fans what is excited for the future of DCEU, we have a lot of be thankful for, and with more reasons to come. So, like what you like, and fight for what you want. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut #Shazam"
"14687","That's why when i say some DCEU fans isn't necessary DC Fans are a really sad thing, what could lead into a toxic path, as we saw in several examples this weekend. Focus on what you like, not what you dislike (for some stupid reasons). #ReleaseTheSnyderCut #Shazam [+]"
"14688","The problem on the DC fandom lies in a share of people (usually DC's Quixotes) what just cannot accept about somebody could want the Snyder Cut AND be excited for the future DCEU movies. [+] #ReleaseTheSnyderCut |#Shazam"

"14692","anyway shazam and iron man 3, you’re both doing amazing and raised billions for the superhero christmas movie genre"
"14693","@DC_FANS_UNITED @tristen_just @CaptainFrugal @UnrankedChevron @MaryMarvelTalk @Dominic52314825 @BoundingComics @hardcpy I saw it earlier today. Great points and video dude. Yeah, it’s frustrating that Superman has strayed so far from the wholesome stories before Bendis. Though yeah, it’s great that the Shazam family gets that still. The art for the Snickers ad was done by Brett Booth by the way."
"14694","@Luis_GVN Honestly yeah. Both movies were really average but I’d rewatch Shazam before rewatching Captain Marvel"
"14695","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie It was an amazing movie and my kids loved every minute of it."
"14696","The most misleading part of Shazam is probably the subways. Septa is not that nice I’ve been using it for years and is not that nice"
"14697","This is the first night I’m not seeing #Shazam <U+0001F614>"
"14698","Thanks @ZacharyLevi. My wife finally got out of her Queen phase from watching Bohemian Rhapsody 3 weeks ago, and then we went and saw #Shazam today. Oh well. The movie was so good it doesn't matter. #dontstopmenow <U+26A1><U+26A1><U+0001F451>"
"14699","What a great superhero @ZacharyLevi! you are awesome #Shazam"
"14700","What a great superheroe @ZacharyLevi! you are awesome #Shazam"
"14701","Shazam! was pretty good, I enjoyed it a bunch. Like Into the Spiderverse, the movie gives the main character motivations other than being a superhero and establishing that at the start seems to make a big difference for me."
"14702","@PeccYz Shazam! go to the movie theater right now and watch it. It is awesome"
"14703","@_CharlesMurphy Yeah, it's like Shazam and Joker. The movies can't really bomb unless literally almost no one sees them. Eternals will be Guardians 2.0, and Shang-Chi will be to the Asian community what BP and CM were for African-American amd female audiences. Guaranteed money makers."
"14704","I had a blast watching shazam, one of the most fun DC movies!"
"14705","@drhernandezusc Hmmmm.... comparing it to Captain Marvel is tricky... they seem like extremely different movies to me. I’ll make a very broad statement that I don’t know that I even agree with: Captain Marvel was cooler, but Shazam was more fun.....?"
"14706","Holy moly. #Shazam is amazing. I loved every second of it. Even my dad, who can't stand Super-Hero movies loved it. Do yourself a favor, go watch this movie!!!"
"14707","would shazam have so many stans if it didn’t have the kid from It? let’s discuss"
"14708","@StewartHaasRcng @Aric_Almirola @BMSupdates @ShazamMovie @SmithfieldBrand Hate to be critical but I think that's what happens when ppl get more SIM and video games than seat time. Ppl whose butts aren't finely attuned to their machine lose their Shft more often real lifers. That's true in an aircraft. Bet the same applies to high performance cars"
"14709","Went to see that movie Shazam because the girlfriend wanted to see it, and as corny as the previews made it seemed. It was actually pretty good / funny."
"14710","I seriously am in love with #Shazam! That movie has so much heart and the third act was so wholesome for a superhero movie. So good! I need to run a #homebydark session with this idea. :)"
"14711","I'm glad to hear Shazam is doing well in the box office. Alot of fanboys on both sides want the other to fail, I just want good movies. Cant wait to see it"
"14712","So the Family and I just got back from watching 4 Movies... BIG THANKS to @RegalMovies... The Girls and I seen @Dumbo and @ShazamMovie, which they highly enjoyed!
After that the girls went home, my Bro-inlaw and I got to watch @petsematarymov and @UsMovie!! 

OVERALL GREAT SUNDAY"
"14713","@BlastloXD @RegalMovies @Dumbo @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @UsMovie Yeah... cause that what I do lol

Over all today cost me a crap ton of cash but It was nice to hang with family and it was nice to see the girls not stress over stuff!"
"14714","Shazam would have been the perfect movie for 12-year-old me. Child self-insert fantasy with just enough scary effects to make it feel edgy, lots of jokes and action, and just overall very positive. Instead I wore out my VHS copy of Supergirl because that's all we had. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"14715","You know what made me smile? I remember watching Raimi's Spider-Man and Iron Man, and they sparked my love for superheroes. I was thinking about how much I loved #Shazam, and then I thought about it being some kids first superhero movie, and it sparking THEIR love for superheroes"
"14716","Personally I don't want a Black Adam movie, I'd just prefer if he's in Shazam 2 or 3, but I don't mind, as long as the movie turns out good. Ideally we get Shazam 2, then the Black Adam movie, and then Shazam 3 with Black Adam as the villain!"
"14717","I just realised this makes no sense. ""because Black Adam in a Shazam movie"".

I meant to say ""because I want to see Black Adam in a Shazam movie"". Oops."
"14718","I just realised this makes no sense. ""because Black Adam in a Shazam movie"".

I meant to say because I want to see Black Adam in a Shazam movie. Oops."
"14719","My thoughts exactly bro"
"14720","Shazam was really good. Solid 8.5/10 for me. 

The Godzilla preview was the best part though (saw at IMAX theater). Super hyped for that movie."
"14721","Sadly, I found #SHAZAM to be vastly underwhelming. I'd thought it to be a little too hokey for my taste and was genuinely bored through most of the film. Levi is still a class act and I dug the emphasis on people being stronger with family. Other than that ... Eh."
"14722","@AmazonChique Two completely different movies with very different budgets. Shazam had a lower budget than Ghostbusters. Shazam's opening weekend gained more or less half its budget so that makes it a success. Just trying to process the point of this tweet tbh."
"14723","Dissappointed by the lack of magic tiger in Shazam"
"14724","Kena tengok la after exams. Honestly taktau pon Marvel ada Captain Marvel if not for the MCU. This, this is the Captain Marvel that I know."
"14725","shazam is now the only valid christmas movie"
"14726","Saw Shazam yesterday, really good and very funny"
"14727","@TheNaijaNerds @OlaWaleAjao @ShazamMovie The question should be will it hit half a billion or not. And answer is no."
"14728","Shazam was amazing! A nice balance between light and dark moments. The heart and soul of the movie is the family, and it really shines right there."
"14729","@RedDead2Arthurr The adult actors from Shazam family were awful. Even though they were there only for a short period"
"14730","disappointed in Shazam. Guess i only like him in smaller doses. Not bad but it wasnt amazing."
"14731","@GraceRandolph here"
"14732","@GalGadot @StepdadJay @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie It’s lovely to see more colour and humour in comic book movies! Love the heart and joy <U+263A><U+FE0F>"
"14733","Why are there absolutely no articles/reviews of #Shazam that point out the irony of Shazam’s original name being #CaptainMarvel especially when drawing comparisons to Marvel’s Captain Marvel."
"14734","@sarahwhit10 Why aren’t any articles pointing out the irony that Shazam’s name used to be Captain Marvel? This article had a perfect apportunity to reinforce its point with a recap of Shazam’s publishing history. Especially with the comparisons to Marvel’s Captain Marvel."
"14735","Friends, about to see Shazam. What to expect?"
"14736","shazam was so sweet and touching .. I don’t talk about it a lot but I was adopted twice within my family so this movie was very heart warming to watch"
"14737","The Shazam end credit has me so hyped for the future of Shazam and the mythology behind it"
"14738","@CrankyTRex Saw Shazam today. It was awesome and thank you for the recommendation!"

"14740","Shazam has been out for 2 days. Stop spoiling stuff for people. Whether it be pictures, details, or even reaction on very specific scenes. Just please stop. Not everyone has time in the world to watch a movie"
"14741","I think Shazam was set in Philadelphia because people wouldn't care about the hundreds of civilian casualties."
"14742","Oh apparently Luke Cage is in some Christian movie about a boy who drowns but survives? I think it's called Breakthrough. There was a trailer before Shazam."
"14743","@yarebmj @NamSaai Umm were you familiar of Shazam before the movie ..."
"14744","Shazam was the first DC movie I watched since The Dark Knight Rises and it was pretty dope"
"14745","@MBOKSR_MAGA I am on a BRAT diet-(health issue-antibiotics got to me). I’m healing, and am starving to death. I could eat the whole thing by myself. Neighbors have a pig roast once a year around the 4th. Put it in the ground, and Shazam-best pork ever. Hope you enjoy. I sure would! <U+0001F60A>"
"14746","Shazam was actually amazing and i highly recommend. Im guessing most of us somewhat related to the character, and there were a lot of laughs. Also Gal Gadot is adorable, per usual."
"14747","@redrabbu I give Shazam! a 8/10. My only complaint was the design choice for the 7 deadly sins. It feel so... “cheap”, it was bothersome and you couldn’t even distinguish which sin was from others. Otherwise, the movie easily became my favorite DC film."
"14748","I didn't get this done, but I should get the missing scene done tomorrow after I see Shazam."
"14749","@ZacharyLevi  saw Shazam again with the fam and will never forget the sound of my little bro crying of laughter. It will forever be etched into my favorite memories. Thanks for all the joy and laughs this movie brought. Round 3 anyone?"
"14750","I’m done putting people on with my music. If you want it, Shazam it."
"14751","#Shazam  was probably the most enjoyable @DCComics  movie I've seen since the Dark Knight series."
"14752","ok... shazam started slow but it got better progressively and also it was formatted in the way of a dc series which is why it was way better than their previous movies"

"14755","Oh yeah I forgot to comment about it. Went to see Shazam yesterday, I give it a solid 8,5/10."
"14756","I didn’t really post any extended thoughts for Shazam on here but man that’s one of the best comic book movies to come out in awhile 
It had so much heart and didn’t try to be anything more than what it was. Zachary Levi did an incredible job. I’d love to see more like this"
"14757","Did you hang on to your Subway sandwich?"
"14758","8/11 In the beginning of the movie it's established that they can persuade even the people worthy enough for the tracking spell cast by Shazam. Then, they don't ever use this again? Disappointing."
"14759","1/11 Just saw #Shazam. Here are my thoughts:
I would say it's above average, but nothing groundbreaking. The character arc is predictable, but it does has one which is good.
I feel like a little too much time was devoted to the gag of filming him using his power."
"14760","8/? In the beginning of the movie it's established that they can pursuade even the people worthy enough for the tracking spell cast by Shazam. Then, they don't ever use this again? Disappointing."

"14762","i love all three dceu movies. wonder woman, aquaman, and shazam. all three. the only ones."

"14764","Smart man, after watching Shazam I feel like that was a great power move to split the two.

Being a Marvel fanatic myself, I will admit DCEU is becoming just as sought after as Marvel as far as movies go."

Now to go watch Shazam with @scotchua. Yes, today is a double feature day."
"14767","Just saw #Shazam and it has a fun-factor of 10! Soooo much better than that disappointing Captain Marvel movie from a month ago.

We all know Avengers: Endgame will be awesome and make like 10 trillion but until then go see the best DC film since Aquaman!"
"14768","just saw Shazam! and I liked it a lot! great chemistry between the leads, pretty funny most of the time, some great costume and character design as well! yes it's clichéd and a bit contrived at points, but that doesn't distract from the genuine heart and story of finding your,"
"14769","We saw shazam last night and it was awesome!! @ZacharyLevi  is one of my favorite actors from Chuck... He did amazing!! Go see the movie!!"
"14770","Shazam was a really fun movie, but be prepared that if you watch it, you will have ""Lightening from my hands!"" stuck in your head for all eternity. 
And then your eight year old will change it to ""poop from my hands,"" so now that's on repeat too."
"14771","@DCEUPosts @Shadewing @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher @ShazamMovie I hear he even more powerful headless."

"14775","I walked into the theater to see @ShazamMovie, and it was warm and dry outside. I walked out of the theater after seeing the movie, and it was cold and everything was somehow wet. What the hell happened in those two hours?!?! Help...?"
"14776",".@ShazamMovie is an adorable and heart-warming, yet satisfyingly action-packed, superhero movie. The movie knew what it was, which was a first for a movie from @TheDCUniverse. I ended up loving this movie, and I may just have to see what DC puts out next!"
"14777","Today, I had planned on seeing @PetSemataryMov, but due to significant delays on my end, I couldn’t make it on time. Instead, I saw @ShazamMovie. My expectations were at zero. The trailers made the movie looked boring, cheesy, and childish. However..."
"14778","*Watching Shazam for the first time* 

Me: 

Me: 

Me: Holy shit his tits are massive"
"14779","Saw Shazam today and enjoyed it. It's not as good as Wonder Woman or Aquaman, imo. Nor the vast majority of Marvel movies. But it is better than the vast majority of DC movies, continuing WBs streak of enjoyable movies, recently"
"14780","The credits for Shazam are so beautiful"

"14793","#Shazam was amazing. Truly electrifying. Amazing job @ZacharyLevi"
"14794","Well just saw @ShazamMovie and well, it was OK. Real fun at spots and a little intentionally corny, but unless you can swallow multiple actors playing Billy, they better make sequels 2 and 3 real quick. Kids age. Me? I’m waiting for @Avengers Endgame. This one? C-plus"
"14795","@AmazonChique Ghostbusters made $229.1 million in its entire run on a $146 million budget. Shazam! only cost $80 to $100 million to make and its already made $158.8 million in its first weekend of release. What are you even on about?"
"14796","Just got home from watching @Shazam! at @AMCTheatres at Dover Mall. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie; the gum stuck to my pants from the side of the seat, not so much. Yuck! Anyone know how to get gum off clothes?"
"14797","I'm hoping that the greatness of the #Shazam movie helps people to realize that @JerryOrdway is one of the great comic book creators of the last 40 years."

"14800","@getFANDOM @TheRock he seems to take a lot of credit for Shazam is what seems to happen. then why wasn't he publicizing it all over his massive social media following constantly?

I DUNNO BOUT THAT ONE SIR"

"14812","#Shazam was omfgrockedawesomebestmoviebetterthanallmoviesbutmaybetiedwith #Aquaman thanks. @ZacharyLevi"
"14813","Shazam was genuinely funny. I’m so sick of superhero movies following serious moments with jokes but Shazam put all the jokes in the right time and place whereas the MCU ruins the drama of scenes by tagging them with cringey one liners."
"14814","for example i'm going to see shazam with my boss tomorrow as if he isn't sick of seeing my dumb ass every day"
"14815","I think Shazam! is what made me so soft today. There is a lot more to that movie than you think and it is fucking precious"
"14816","i just finished watching Shazam, funny movie. and for some reason the evil guy made me think of voldemort <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"14817","Shazam is far out the best super hero movie that has come out this decade 

Shazam is funnier than any marvel film fact funnier than most comedy and finds a way to balance dark and funny tones in a perfect way #Shazam"

"14822","Rewatching Annabelle: Creation because of much I loved Shazam, and it seems like David F. Sandberg has a thing for positive, supportive foster homes and that’s real nice"
"14823","@greentauros Omg I am so sorry for you. People need to understand that these are just films and that they shouldn’t be taken so seriously. I hope you get better. And I also hope you enjoyed Shazam regardless of your bad theater experience"
"14824","Director. He could NOT put a cameo in HIS movie. Otherwise it’s the studio, not the actor."
"14825","Honestly my only reason to go and watch “Shazam” is Because Eminem’s “My name is” is the soundtrack and that’s his first track of first album and it makes me fucking nostalgic for some reason."
"14826","@StarbuckIm @Variety Captain marvel spent maybe 400 max on captain marvel returned a profit of like 600 million or so, Shazam might get a profit of like 200 million max imo"
"14827","shazam was such an amazing movie

dc really came through with this one"
"14828","@DCComics @ZacharyLevi  
Shazam was mediocre and slow paced and boring"
"14829","I agree because Superman has been the more populuar hero the narrative is he would win, however next to Kryptonight, Magic is his next biggest weakness. Shazam's powerlevel is Equal in my eyes to Superman but Mystical. That's a Trump card to me. A.Ross demos a little in kingdom.."
"14830","@ZacharyLevi Took my boys to see Shazam tonight. They loved it! My eight year old was so excited when everyone joined the fight. It was great! #SayMyNameMovie #ShazamMovie #shazam"
"14831","I really want to see Shazam again!"
"14832","Caught Shazam a second time with friends. The tonal issues are still there. It's still a fun blast that's funny when it wants to be, but man, Billy's personal arc mixed with his superhero antics never click together. And I wish Freddy and Mary were more like their classic selves."
"14833","#Shazam is the best DC movie ever!"
"14834","@Browntable_Ent I don't know why they didn't release Shazam in December. They could have switched Release dates with Aquaman."

"14836","@MarkKolpack @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi Loved it, except the very easy to predict ending and it abruptly turning into a power rangers fight scene... also the bad guys looked lousy... but Zachary Levi was the best. Finally a good DC movie!"
"14837","@ShazamMovie That was one of the best movies I watched this year. It was dark and made light hearted comedy that really balanced out better than I thought it would going in. The little girl was adorable, funny and best little sister ever."

- a young boy wants to be more grown up 
- a mystical figure grants his wish
- it’s inappropriate for me to be sexually attracted to the adult versions of the boys but I cannot be tamed!!!!! in conclusion: 80s tom hanks can get it"
"14848","Shazam is alot of fun! Did some very surprising things, didn't hold your hand much (considering how complicated everything surrounding the character is)

Only gripe was it felt slightly dragged towards the ending, but I'm very satisfied otherwise"
"14849","Hugely enjoyed watching #Shazam . Very funny and great performances. Can only recommend."

"14882","Ok... #ShazamMovie ! I will try not to do spoilers.

Let me start right out by saying I don't usually watch superhero movies. I have never seen a single film in the MCU, and the last DC movie I saw was The Dark Knight Rises. I'm not even especially good at movies in general."

"14886","@getFANDOM @TheRock I feel that the saga of #Shazam in the cinema, if he manages to make the ship get enough profits before #AvengersEndgame, we could see a franchise of the #DCEU type #HarryPotter but superheroes."
"14887","@getFANDOM @TheRock I would close the franchise of #Shazam with five movies, two films based on #BlackAdam and 3 of #Shazam, looking for a bow in the style of the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter but in the superheroic genre.

apparently he and ""a line of people"" watched the entire movie from start to finish, decided they didn't like it, then demanded their money back from the theater (and got it).

imagine being that big of an ass"
"14890","Not going to lie, between loving Shazam! and being disappointed in Captain Marvel has kind of put doubt in my mind about the MCU's future. 
Like, I thought CM was very bland and had bad choices, whereas I flat out LOVED Shazam thoroughly."

"14901","@AbdullAlMisnad @NamSaai nope, the closest I’ve gotten to Shazam before the movie was the song recognition app. I’m not into comics- just recognize a trash movie when I watch one"
"14902","After watching Shazam, DC has proved that they can make good movies again. Absolutely static."
"14903","So I went to see Shazam today and it was great. But shout out to my freaking hero today, the guy sitting next to me. Some freaking DonkeyHoles were sitting behind us (six of them), not shutting up, and this man stood up and spoke some magic words ""Yo, Shut up!"" My hero. ^^"
"14904","There you go. Cutest thing on the internet today."
"14905","Saw #Shazam today and was thoroughly impressed! It was a really good movie that wasn’t full of cringy kid memes and all that like I thought it would. 

Shazam does do the floss for not even half a second but that’s the only sort of “cringy” thing it has.

Definitely recommend it!"
"14906","And fandom let’s just ENJOY #ShazamMovie no comparisons, trash talk, etc just revel in a solid superhero story."
"14907","#ShazamMovie is super fun! A nice blend of grittiness and heart. I have to say marketing did not do a good job with trailers ! I thought it was going to be way sillier and it wasn’t! Maybe it was to protect some plot points but the toys kind of spoiled the “family” part anyway"

Philly is the only East Coast town that could be trusted to root for a super hero like Captain Marvel. The other cities’ cynicism and world-weariness mitigate against whole-heartedly embracing a goof. (Ref. @GrittyNHL)"
"14916","@ZacharyLevi what is your favorite DC movie other than Shazam ?"
"14917","@ZacharyLevi Shazam was won of my favorite movies of all time good job at acting and good job DC<U+0001F44F><U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"14918","@ShazamMovie a YouTuber who only likes marvel movies went to see Shazam and like it alot"

"14923","Shazam! (2019) is the story of a young boy who becomes disillusioned with capitalism and dons the red and yellow of communism to lift up the people around him"
"14924","@TheNelGOD I do think it's cool that WW, Aquaman, Shazam! and even the unholy mess of Batman v. Superman all feel pretty separate."
"14925","Great movie, highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of goonies, big or any other classic 80s films."
"14926","And exploring the childlike fun of superheroes. I'm glad that same feeling I have about Shazam made it into the movie. While it took a minute getting there, it delivered on a fun and uplifting story of found family and doing the best you can to be a good person."
"14927","Oh yeah, forgot the #hastags #CaptainMavel #SHAZAM #ShazamMovie #comics #movies #marvel #DCUNIVERSE"
"14928","DC has been...hit or miss imo. Plenty of folks have STRONG opinions but I'll just say that I like fun superheroes. Drama is great but I lived thru the grimdark comics era and don't miss it. Shazam has always stood in contrast by being generally lighthearted..."
"14929","Stay until the end of Shazam!"
"14930","Saw Shazam tonight. it's literally the most fun i've had watching a superhero film in a long time."
"14931","WOW Shazam was absolutely phenomenal!! Y'all  neeeeeed to go see it"

"14933","Wanting the Snydercut is one thing, but hating everything else is another. I too want the SC bt I cant live my life with hatred. Some of you being bitches &amp; posting spoilers from #Shazam is wrong. It is someone's vision. You r no better than WB execs if you mess with that."
"14934","#SHAZAM was an absolute delight! Pure fun and put a smile on my face from beginning to end.  Could not recommend this film enough. @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover crushing it as always!"
"14935","@BoxerlessBossk Not just mine but tbh if it stars a woman or LGBT, or POC, I’ll likely be more interested. Like I was more interested in Captain Marvel than Shazam tbh. 
As far as peaking my interest goes at least."
"14936","About to watch @ShazamMovie. I can't wait. Will post my thoughts here after."
"14937","How Shazam is mentioned Pittsburgh in dceu"
"14938","@neontaster I enjoyed it and laughed a lot more than thanks to most movies I've watched recently. Which is kind of sad, because so much of the Shazam humor was corny.

Also, Darla stole my heart."
"14939","Shazam is one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen."
"14940","@cinemasins Best part of my Monday commute. Any Shazam hot takes on that there episode?"
"14941","I’m crying"
"14942","It bugs me that in the dub it's ""¡Shazam!""
It feels unnecessary"
"14943","@DCComics @ShazamMovie It turns out Shazam is actually a Christmas movie"
"14944","“Shazam!” Is an amazing stand alone movie in its own right and also a great gateway to the Shazam comic books (or Captain Marvel for you OGs) it’s an amazing film full of heart and genuine hilarity and it’s basically one massive love letter to the Shazam mythos, Go see it."
"14945","everyone keeps tweeting about general conference as if that’s more important than shazam"
"14946","@ZacharyLevi I saw Shazam today an loved it, you were made to play him"
"14947","Seeing #Shazam for the 2nd time. Your welcome @DCComics @ZacharyLevi it’s really a great movie."
"14948","Just came out of seeing Shazam and WOW what a funny movie. Zachary Levi is amazing as the title character while Jack Dylan Grazer and Mark Strong are great as well. Along with the acting, the hilarious humour keeps the movie going right along from beginning to end. Well deserved."
"14949","Also next Sunday I will be seeing Shazam which will be totally metal :)"
"14950","<U+2506>Shazam is the #1 movie in the world, I'm so proud!"
"14951","@toocheesyadrian Like you could turn into Shazam, or you just are Shazam?"
"14952","Orlando Magic baby!!!! Don’t be a fan now!!!! Also Shazam is soooo good! You can definitely be a fan of that!"
"14953","@djalexryanmusic Nobody said this. Hard to beat something that was advertised huge amount , released on Women's Day, was controlled by review sites to pander to Disney, and was a preview months before the biggest movie of all-time.

Shazam going to get money on just word of mouth. No comparison."
"14954","@ShazamMovie is hilarious and a blast to watch!! Well done DC!!!"
"14955","#Shazam is awesome! Spectacular cast! Funny, suspenseful and heartwarming! Well done all! Well done!! @ZacharyLevi you were perfect!"
"14956","@LuminaOrchis @AmazonChique How is Shazam brand new? It's as old as Superman. It's weird to give it a pass just cause the budget was lower. I'm sure it's a fine move though."
"14957","Is it toxic feminism in action? No, the children must be wrong."
"14958","the fuck is wrong with people."
"14959","It deserves to make at least more than JL. I hope the date placement doesn’t affect it too much <U+0001F62A>"
"14960","The first half of Shazam was really really good. The second half was just ok. Overall the movie was pretty decent though. I’ll honestly give it a 8/10 it’s a pretty fun movie<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

"14964","I need a vlog or something for these Wanza reviews lol"
"14965","@TheComixKid Hearing it wasn't Cavill is disappointing, seeing as I haven't seen the film yet; I love Cavill and I feel WB is not making a great move with all this un-linked, just for the heck of it films.
I'm not judging Shazam, I'm looking forward to seeing it here soon...just disappointed"
"14966","Just saw Shazam! Wow it was actually a really good film, I had an absolute blast. Gave me a legit nostalgia trip to being a kid again."
"14967","@jitka I agree with your takeaways except for the part about other DC movies. Shazam is nothing like the other DC movies."
"14968","Several hours later and the more I think about #Shazam! And it’s overall message of kindness and family - the more I love the film. Great job @ZacharyLevi and the entire Shazam crew."
"14969","@NiallOfficial @leona_maguire @ROAD2LPGA @modestgolf i heard slow hands while watching shazam today bc it plays in the one of the scenes and im so proud of u ! i love u so much &lt;3"

"14975","#Shazam was good... really good, in fact. Infectious, hilarious, and a great time at the movies! Go see it!"
"14976","@dielinmars Probably turn into Shazam, just change your alter ego with one word idk I feel it'd be one of the best superheroes to be"
"14977","Shazam with 102 Million first weekend? DAMN. Alright DC. Stop being gritty and dark and be different! Keep this in mind!"
"14978","@Diction Your right it didn’t reinvent anything, but there is one change that really like from most of the other marvel/dc movies. Billy/Shazam was a dynamic character. He learns from things and changes. Feels like everyone is so perfect sometimes. Except iron man 1 and ant man."
"14979","@Cassius005 @ShazamMovie I was expecting a horrible film based on the trailer. But Shazam! Was really good and I laughed more than I expected to. Not because of how bad it was but because it was just funny. #Shazam"
"14980","So @ShazamMovie was hella fun. It was funny. Zach Levy was hilarious. The kid actors were good &amp; I loved the theme of family."

"14990","I didn't get to see this cause my group wanted to watch Pet Sematary <U+0001F616> I'm watching it new week definitely."
"14991","#SHAZAM was pretty good ... very surprising from @DCComics as it is a very different type of superhero movie @AMCTheatres ... #mrmindforever"
"14992","@FaitheHerman in Shazam made me wanna have a little girl <U+0001F629> and if you know me you know I NEVER wanted a girl"
"14993","Shazam was fine,,, until it tried to be a superHERO movie. I wonder when DC will stop trying to catch up to Marvel’s tone. Anyway, Zachary Levi is always a win :))))"
"14994","I missed this due to being a good big sister (taking my brother out to dinner and to see Shazam) but I’m watching it now and reading+loving all the quips I missed. Damn y’all are lovely funny humans. (But where are all the DumE gifs?!?? Devastation!)"
"14995","We end Shazam with my bestie and we LOVE IT guys you did an amazing work im so proud (im praying for a second part) @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @jackdgrazer"
"14996","Loved Shazam! Had issues w/ the 1st act but everything else is good! It was a breath of fresh air to see a DC movie with a lot of humor &amp; most especially a lot of heart! :) I’d love to see more of these movies from DC in the future!"
"14997","@HappyManor @molratty @OrdyPackard @pipandbaby @JustEric @PolitiBunny @JakeMcMeFace1 @Lcmwriter100 We can call you the DC version, if that helps! Shazam!!!!, etc..."
"14998","Shazam is basically visit Philly campaign and I'm kinda sold (also didn't see the acronym coming)."
"14999","@AsmrSelkie @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @HellboyMovie Not a fan of horror personally, but I hear Pet Sematary is pretty good"
"15000","@theonlytroyever @JesabelRaay You’re 100% accurate in that we haven’t seen him take this type of role before. But I truly believe he might be able to pull it off. Plus with the tone of Shazam mixed with the menacing of Black Adam it might be a match made in heaven."
"15001","I saw #Shazam @ShazamMovie today. It was the best goddamn thing I’ve watched in a long time, I’m not exaggerating either."
"15002","@CTVNews You need a new movie critic. Chris Bumbray got the city wrong for Shazam (it's based in Philly) and his review was also ""formulaic"" in his criticism of superhero movies. I could give a better review than this dud!"
"15003","Just saw Shazam. Pretty meh. A lukewarm experience. My expectations were extremely low and while it exceeded my expectations, it’s nothing to write home about. That 2hr 12min run time felt really long as well. I don’t recommend seeing it."
"15004","I need to go check ‘Shazam!’ Out"
"15005","Shazam really paid Wonder Woman in dust, but rode that batman/superman wave for 2 hours and 12 minutes."
"15006","Deserved. This movie was a really fresh take on superhero films. It was great."
"15007","The Shazam movie was “terrible” it was just extremely corny.... like all the other DC character superheroes."
"15008","The Shazam movie WASN’T terrible” it was just extremely corny.... like all the other DC character superheroes."
"15009","@JimmyRGeorge Pet Sematary and Shazam.

Enjoyed the latter.

The former, not so much."
"15010","Dad: So do you think Shazam will tie in with the rest of the DC movies?
Me and Joe in unison: Dad, the DC universe is falling apart."
"15011","Shazam has probably been the best, recent DC movie that’s been put out."
"15012","There is so much good and bad with the DC extended universe. At least there is flash who could probably alter the timeline aka the reset button."
"15013","Dyed hair <U+2705>
Glasses <U+2705>
Dumbass statement <U+2705>"
"15014","i saw Shazam two days ago and i’m still thinking about this scene"
"15015","Now, his meeting with wb, a long time ago, about ""FUN"" makes sense. I want to see these two fighting each other but this would not only steal Shazam's CHARACTER tone but The Rock would steal the main hero's spot easily, so, there's a Black Adam movie to put the rock on the spot."
"15016","Surprised at how much fun I had watching @ShazamMovie. Movie has a ton of heart. Going to see it again!
#Shazam"
"15017","Bout to watch this Shazam movie alone .....

*looks at one deep tattoo* - @PrettyGordoIBe"
"15018","yall were actually pumped for this omg... I thought y’all were kidding"
"15019","@ColossalChloe I really enjoyed Shazam but am happy to hear Godzilla: King of the Monsters is looking good so far! I wish I lived near an imax."
"15020","Happy for Zachary Levi. Fan here since his Chuck days. <U+0001F60D>"
"15021","@AlphaStoutland Oh cool! Shazam is basically like a magic based Superman but with electric powers. The trailers kinda made him look like a lame hero but it's not the case. I also did some research about the character before I saw it.

And of course like DC always is, it gets preeetty dark."
"15022","Now I can finally die in peace. Read this you bums"
"15023","It’s been Zachary Levi’s with Maisel and Shazam and therefore it’s MY YEAR"
"15024","Shazam was good and all but I’m confused. So does shazam and Wonder Woman have the same Greek god powers? #ShazamMovie #DCU"
"15025","Sheldon being a super hero. I’d probably be dead before the germs he sprays lysol on dies."
"15026","Done saw SHAZAM!

I'd say it's worth a recommendation for theatres to push DC to go more in this direction because this is the first DCEU movie I've liked. I can't say it's as good as most MCU origins but it did have moments and definitely a step up."
"15027","guys please tag your shazam spoilers its not hard"
"15028","Yasssss! Congratulations to @ZacharyLevi, @AsherAngel, #jackdylangrazer and the whole cast and crew of @ShazamMovie!"
"15029","Shazam was so good! I appreciated how edgy it was with it’s humor and tone. Zachary Levi was incredible."
"15030","Have not seen Shazam yet (maybe tonight!) but it seems like it’s going to have the same opening weekend as Green Lantern did 8 years ago. GL was called a massive flop. Superhero films have only gotten bigger in those 8 years. What’s the difference here besides critical reception?"
"15031","To be clear, this isn’t intended as a dig. I’m actually really excited to see Shazam. I’m just genuinely interested in the business explanation. Was GL just massively more expensive?"
"15032","Hello I went to see the shazam movie and it was really albanian done shots some albanian jokes (not all of them tho) my albanian part of the movie is the costume of shazam I think DC is finally getting albanian with their movies I give it a albanian/10 would watch it again"
"15033","'Shazam' felt reminiscent of Malcom in the Middle &amp; just for that it gets an A+"
"15034","@seganesjr Ah gotcha. Me, I'm just hoping to watch Creed II or Shazam this week, while I'm doing mini-labors."
"15035","I actually really liked Shazam <U+0001F605>"
"15036","I just think it’s funny that he immediately got defensive over me saying “I’m not surprised that you said Shazam is better”"
"15037","@timaay_turner @big_business_ Totally unrelated but which Blocboy JB song is this? Shazam on my phone ain’t working"
"15038","shazam has been out for two days and has already grossed a total of $155 million. nice :)"

"15041","This is what it’s all about"
"15042","Trying to Shazam local music is exhausting. It linked me to power drills on amazon. What the fuck"
"15043","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Brother???? Hell no...

He was trying to impress you and you calling him brother....

Noooooooo

Nop.. nop... nop...."
"15044","I heard Shazam and Dumbo were both great movies haven’t heard a bad review yet"
"15045","Shazam was the best Superman movie in decades. It even has a much better Lex Luthor type villain than BvS had."
"15046","Shazam!- In stark contrast to DC’s Film Universe, Shazam offers a fun and goofy tone; but still an intelligent personality.  After 2017’s “It”, Jack Dylan Grazer continues to impress in his early career.  Shazam adds to Warner Bros. catalog of new and exciting franchises."
"15047","Did you just say Shazam is better than US? <U+0001F602> They are two different movies !!! #cannotcompare"
"15048","@ZacharyLevi Just watched Shazam and it was very cool and comic!!"
"15049","#Shazam Was Good As Hell! I’ll Obviously Be Going To See It Again!"
"15050","Music for tonight’s @SHO_Billions was on point as it always is.<U+0001F44F> Can’t ever recall watching a show with @Shazam on standby like the way I do for Billions @briankoppelman @DavidLevien."
"15051","#Shazam was fun!  It didn’t take itself too seriously, had a villain with a real motivation, and most importantly has a lot of heart.  Why did it remind me of The Greatest American Hero?  Anyone remember that show?"
"15052","Dad of the year goes to....."
"15053","Shazam was amazing I really underestimated this movie wow"
"15054","Shazam! is really good. Haven’t seen a DC movie in a while but I have a feeling that what separates this one from the apparently not so great ones is that it’s driven by likeable and real characters. Very fun movie, 8/10."
"15055","Capping off a wonderful weekend with a showing of @ShazamMovie with the inestimable @ZacharyLevi. One more uplifting thing before the difficult week ahead. #Shazam!"
"15056","just found out shazam had post credit scenes ........  what is this marvel? smh"
"15057","I hate him so much for that he’s honestly just decided to spill all of his colors this year and he really should have just sat there and ate his food"
"15058","Dont sleep on #SHAZAM <U+26A1><U+FE0F> DC needs to stick to individual hero movies. Thats their strong suit"
"15059","It is a fun movie. Its based on the new 52 Shazam story arc that @geoffjohns and Gary Frank made as part of a backup feature to the Justice League comic."
"15060","@AsherAngel and @ZacharyLevi, you guys are the perfect Billy Batson!!! Its nice seeing Asher transform into you, Zachary!!! Please reply to my tweet here!!! It will make my day!!!! And not only that, I also want to tell you guys that i love your new movie!! #ShazamMovie is lit!!"
"15061","Come on #philly, rise up to the occasion!"
"15062","I enjoyed #Shazam! 

Some random musings:

*Finally! A movie w/ likable child actors
*Liked the BlackAdam tease at beginning of film
*Recurring Santa gag was a hoot
*Funny that John Glover plays the dad of another bald villain
*Nice that Seth from The OC finally gets to play hero"
"15063","@DarthStan @AngryJoeShow Just seen Shazam. It might the most entertaining one so (by) far. It has its flaws, but it's lol funny at times. I agree with your assessment. You've summed up my feelings about them pretty accurately. Except SS and JL are both garbage. 1k ppl, 1k opinions..."
"15064","Oh wow. I've read the comics and this makes me feel good."
"15065","Shazam was hella good. Definitely the best DCU movie to come out so far. Solid 8/10.<U+0001F44D>"
"15066","@aaron_lozada They only have 4Dx in BGC yata, but not sure if they’re showing Shazam"
"15067","Happy to be wrong. Shazam! is great. They really pulled it off."
"15068","i’m literally screaming in about to be obsessed with shazam"
"15069","@ZacharyLevi Hay Zach Ive now have watch Shazam 3 times now going for number 4th and 5th time this week. WoW the best DCEU movie so far. Tell everyone who worked on the film thanks for their hard work."
"15070","Who’s trying to go watch Shazam Tuesday morning ? Please not everyone at once <U+0001F643>"
"15071","So I went to see Shazam today and it was definitely better than what I thought it was gonna be but the best part was when Slow Hands started playing lol"
"15072","@ZacharyLevi I have loved you since Chuck!!!! Can’t wait to see Shazam. So proud of you and happy for you!!!"
"15073","In the sequel to Shazam, I would love if they settle on the name Captain Thunder. A reference to flashpoint and a compromise for the name captain marvel."
"15074","I still need to see SHAZAM ! I’m hearing a lot of positive comments on it."
"15075","I like #ZacharyLevi enough to go see a superhero movie!"
"15076","@papaditto @Partizan_Niksic @cooperclark501 @BobDigi69 @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Yeah.. you only got half the news, mate.
The original script wasnt filmed. But his actual movie was. Basically, there's 3 JL scripts: 1 that never got shot. 1 that did. And 1 that was reshot and made it to release after Zack was pushed off. 
The 2nd one is the one we ask for"
"15077","Shazam is probably one of the best superhero movies hands down!"
"15078","The best part of Shazam was the 5 min Godzilla preview before the movie started."
"15079","Imagine an alternate reality where Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam were the first three films of the DCEU. If those were the beginning, exactly as they were, this series would’ve had a MUCH better start."
"15080","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie You should do that outake where Shazam takes Wonder Woman to the prom."
"15081","I would've laughed even harder if this was real"
"15082","So #shazam is the best dc superhero film by far and my god Adam Brody and Zachary Levi were two of my biggest crushes in my early 20s.  They do not seem to age. <U+0001F60D>"
"15083","i COULD go to class tomorrow and then see shazam im so torn"
"15084","@ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @ponysmasher thanks for giving me the best experience ive ever had. watching shazam was a gift to me. i laughed, i cried, i loved. thanks for the message the movie gives us, for making shazam my favorite hero and favorite movie
im proud and love u guys <U+2764>"
"15085","Thoughts on #Shazam: really enjoyed the movie. The one scene that didn't sit well with me and felt out of place was the boardroom scene. It was a little over the top and didn't really fit the feel of the rest of the movie. But I'm also not a big horror fan."
"15086","Going to see #Shazam on Tuesday!!"
"15087","Saw #Shazam this weekend and LOVED IT. Great film, great Shazam-ness, excellent casting. @ZacharyLevi is perfect."
"15088","@arris_quinones Perfect way to introduce the world to Shazam"
"15089","2019 went all out and gave us liveaction Shazam kids"
"15090","Holy moly was Shazam everything I expected &amp; more. A small story with a universal heartfelt message. That cameo in the end was perfect."
"15091","I really liked it"
"15092","@getFANDOM @TheRock Just saw #Shazam and it was well done. Families will love it. Making a bunch of orphans superheroes, just brilliant.  The cameo was a perfect lead up to the next few movies. We could have used a head on #Superman but it doesn’t take anything away from the movie."
"15093","@ZacharyLevi you were wonderful in Shazam; I don’t care for the current DCEU but you were wonderful in this movie. Loved it to bits and I can’t wait to see you in future sequels!"
"15094","#Shazam is the best DC Universe movie to date. Don’t @ me."
"15095","@pulpjedi Very interesting. I have similar feelings about Shazam, and I’m seeing similar feedback."
"15096","@Ser_Jon_Arryn @verotruesocial Waiting for your Shazam review."
"15097","The #RELEASETHESNYDERCUT movment is abt more than fulfilling your pathetic lives with a movie you wanted to see. Its abt artistic freedom. Not giving the #Shazam team the respect to tell a story theur way is undermining the whole message of the movement."
"15098","Yo #Shazam is an awesome movie. It’s the best movie I’ve seen in a while."
"15099","Shazam, but for emotionally distant fathers. #TCDisrupt"
"15100","With @ShazamMovie DC remembers to have fun again. Bob's review will be up tomorrow!
#Shazam"
"15101","#Shazam is the best Superman origin movie in a decade or two
<U+0001F606>"
"15102","Finished watching #Shazam. Probably the best DC movie? Felt like the only one that had any real heart into it, instead of trying to look cool for angsty teenagers.

Also I’d have never spotted @konjak if he hadn’t posted a frame of when he appears. Shame on me"

"15107","@mjpeez I liked Shazam and hated US. I gue u can’t ever take me to te movies <U+0001F606>"
"15108","@mortrager Saw Shazam. Definitely horror-esque elements to the demons. They’re quite scary. No gore, but a lot of implied carnage. Eight year old was ok with it but definitely scared."
"15109","I rewatched Shazam, of course, and watch Pet Semetary. I liked both movies in their respective category. Although I'd have to rewatch Pet Semetary again since I almost fell asleep twice but really didn't miss any key points of the movie."
"15110","So, @RealJohnGlover's pattern is to play the fathers of DC supervillains who don't appreciate his parental style. @michaelrosenbum #markstrong #Smallville @ShazamMovie #LexLuthor #LionelLuthor #ThaddeusSivana #FatherSivana Lol"
"15111","#ShazamMovie was an absolute blast! I had so much fun with it &amp; genuinely enjoyed every second. I love how it blends coming-of-age comedy &amp; magic themed horror elements into a superhero movie. It’s got so much heart &amp; soul. @ZacharyLevi is perfect &amp; @ponysmasher delivered! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"15112","So. . . .SHAZAM!

Great movie, 90% wholesome.  I wish more comic movies were made like that.  

Only big negatives to me, CGI was a bit off in some places and the some of the child actors were not great, but okay.

Makes me want to see meteor man again."
"15113","i wish i had shazam in my head so when i’m thinking of a song but only know the beat i know the name"
"15114","Really liked #Shazam! The final fight did drag on a bit, but the humor and characters out shine any complaint I had about the movie. Also I loved that @alamodrafthouse played old Captain Marvel serials before the movie."
"15115","Agreed! Just saw @ShazamMovie with my beautiful wife @jmefuller1986 #Shazam is awesome!"
"15116","Shazam gave me the laughs I really needed"
"15117","If y’all have any photos of the shazam family please dm, I won’t tweet them I just wanna see the excellence again"
"15118","The shazam family scene was the justice league we deserved too see"
"15119","Pues ya fui a ver Shazam... Thanks @wbpictures, this is, by far, the worst live action ever, thank you so much for wasting one of the best DC's characters in your vain attempt of ""winning"" the Adam Sandler's humouristic contest against Marvel."
"15120","I'll only say this once. GO SEE @ShazamMovie.  @ZacharyLevi, congrats on making an absolutely fantastic super hero flick.  THIS needs to be the guide for the future of the DCU.  #JustSayin"
"15121","I mean consider man of steel casualty count"
"15122","@RealJohnGlover @michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi You really did a great job in @ShazamMovie loved it!"

"15126","@MrZMovies I'll say this... #Shazam was pretty well done. It was very kids friendly until the demon scenes. The pace of the movie was good. Had some matrix like fight scenes. Solid, solid flick."
"15127","someone please protect these kids"
"15128","There can only be one captain marvel.."
"15129","shazam! was sooo amazing?? it’s honestly all the happiness in the world put into one movie. it’s so inspiring &amp; hilarious &amp; motivating and @ZacharyLevi was an absolute GIFT. i’m so so so in love with this movie. #Shazam"
"15130","@_celia_bedelia_ Given the number of blockbusters that think the only way to raise the stakes is through massive destruction and an ever-increasing bodycount, I was pleased &amp; impressed by the way Shazam! managed to ratchet up the tension while avoiding those tropes."
"15131","@KevinMcCarthyTV What'd you think of @petsematarymov? Also @ShazamMovie 3D or not necessary? Thanks."
"15132","I'm sad there's no lightning logo with the #Shazam hashtag anymore."
"15133","@billversos @ShazamMovie what?"
"15134","@billversos @ShazamMovie no I mean the I don’t care part"
"15135","@SuperWinterGirl @pedroangelnsc @Partizan_Niksic They are attacking the studio not the cast and director. The studio is responsible for the lighter, more comedic tone and the horrendous Superman cameo.
Shazam is good, but there is room for criticism because this movie could’ve been a lot better if not for the studio."
"15136","@CDawsonAuthor These people are idiots sometimes but they are still allowed to be critical of the movie and prefer a different approach to these characters. You are aware Shazam and Aquaman would’ve been more serious and less comedic if WB weren’t as reactionary as they were? They’re still good"
"15137","@lexluthox @Blu_Soldier001 @Josh2Gud4U I said I would’ve preferred a more serious Shazam movie with less jokes and more serious tone lmfao Shazam is still good I like it but I’m not a fanboy."
"15138","@ZacharyLevi he represents everyone after seeing the movie!! you were born to play shazam! thank you so much for bringing to life such a great character in a humorous and real way. love you <U+0001F970>"
"15139","Mark Strong stans at anyone who has seen Shazam and complimented his performance: ARE YOU ONE OF US? ARE THERE MORE THAN THREE OF US?"
"15140","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Just got out of the movie a few hours ago and IT'S SO CAMPY!!! Go see it whenever you get the chance"
"15141","Just finished Shazam, that was way better than I expected. It may have the origins plot but they pull off some great humor that DC needed and hope this gets a sequel."
"15142","If you like feel-good christian movies about the power of prayer you will LOVE
Shazam"
"15143","As a teacher going into testing week, my self-care moment came via @ZacharyLevi and #Shazam 
Genuinely funny, feel-good movie, made complete by the little girl screaming in the theater when Billy was plunging into the pavement. #noSpoilers #theWholeTheaterWasRolling"
"15144","Okay but #Shazam was highkey a fun movie and I had such a good time watching it"
"15145","For someone who looks they can squash Shazam, Drew McIntyre sure loses a lot.

#WrestleMania"
"15146","No offense but it just looks like he’s trying to have a lead role in all this"
"15147","I don’t like quoting yms but comparing Shazam to the original spider man trilogy with just less style is really accurate , even the sets of the film remind me of a set off spider-man"
"15148","Update: Shazam was very good and now I’m going to go home and draw Shazam fanart"
"15149","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Just you wait. He's going to take you to his high school prom in the batmobile."
"15150","@AqeelDC Mos then Shazam...so surprised it was this good, ww and aquaman are tied for me after that."
"15151","@DCComics has redeemed themselves with Shazam. Excellent movie"
"15152","If you look at DEADPOOL and SHAZAM! both movies had more modest; by superhero movie standards; budgets, but made up for it in sheer entertainment value...that mean less city destroying stakes and more grounded, personal, stakes and more character focused stories."
"15153","There is no BIG plot in SHAZAM! Sivana's motivations and his overall scheme were about as petty and small minded as a plot from SMALLVILLE or something. There isn't a ton of action in SHAZAM! There's really one BIG set piece at the end...everything else is just CHARACTER."
"15154","@StewartHaasRcng @Aric_Almirola @BMSupdates @ShazamMovie @SmithfieldBrand No driver should go into turn one driving over his head,the first freaking lap of the race. You think anyone wants to be around the #24 car starting next week? Hardly the fault of @Aric_Almirola. If it happens lap 100 ok but lap 1"
"15155","I've thought about it for a couple days and here's my DCEU rankings post #SHAZAM having just rewatched all the movies again prior to Shazam:

1. SHAZAM
2. Aquaman
3. Wonder Woman
4. Man of Steel
5. Justice League
6. Suicide Squad
7. BvS"
"15156","@rickhfox Cool. My wife and I will be checking it out next weekend. It looks like it might be a lot of fun #Shazam"
"15157","@wrytersview “Heart” is something I didn’t realize was missing from modern films before watching Shazam."
"15158","@CarleeezyR @JSmallZee @bryanloveswater Shazam was great. I loved the humor and especially the themes. It was about family and how you can't make it on your own, you need close relationships. That was cool as heck."
"15159","@spideymemoir @MrNiceGuy18_58 @UpToTASK @CJWritesThings @_BrooklynBatman @DecodnLyfe @JaySandlin_WHN @SuperSuitShow @CBNostalgia @AKARELK @AdultnamedRob Shazam has PLENTY of dark things in it that don't go against the core of who the character fundamentally is."
"15160","Shazam is the best DCEU movie... It's not close. It shows how much fun a super hero movie can really be... I'm now sad that Wonder Woman and Aquaman sequels are coming first, seem boring in comparison"
"15161","@robsforman I think GL had all the makings of a good movie just the one critical piece was the story. Too much too fast. Reynolds was fine the CGI suit was fine but the villain was just a mindless, boring evil. I haven’t seen Shazam so I can’t compare the stories."
"15162","Went and saw Shazam,no idea who the target audience was,most incompetent villain ever,no risks taken what so ever,and unresolved plot points"
"15163","I walked into Shazam with low hopes but I’m happy to report that movie was fantastic!"
"15164","Shazam was actually a pretty great movie"
"15165","Saw @ShazamMovie tonight with @LKMattis1. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Would recommend seeing it!"
"15166","the Justice League as far as I can tell consists of Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam"
"15167","@robsforman Thinking about how many  April movies have come out and still to come. There's a lot of expense. Also LA area average tickets are $15 depending on location.
#Shazam was so enjoyable. Slow at the beginning then Levi put out of the park.
And #AvengersEndgame is coming up."

"15176","remember when shazam said heroes deserve rights and created an actual banger?"
"15177","@The_Wotch Well, we know Gal Gadot isn't going anywhere. Looks like Jason-born-to-play-Lobo will remain Aquaman. New 52 Shazam is coming. Ezra Flash movie still happening?

So who knows what the next era/installment will be. It'll probably be a mix of old and new, just like the comics."

"15202","Shazam was the an amazing DC super hero movie. I enjoyed it."
"15203","@TheComixKid I get what you are saying but those films WEREN'T meant/ made for her age. And that is OK. Shazam was for a younger/ family audience. And that is ok. At the end of the day everyone deserves to have their story told and MoS was mine and Shazam was my sons."
"15204","@GeoffThorne This would. You hear a song, Shazam it and now it’s in your head canon for when you’re mixing and need a needle drop or need new writing music. :)"
"15205","@zackkkkkk94 I LOVE CHUCK. It’s one of my favorites movies! I’m so excited to see Shazam. I’m going tomorrow alone lol."
"15206","shazam is amazing i wasnt expecting it to be good considering the other dc movies but shazam did that and managed to play dont stop me now and legend in one movie !!!!"

"15208",":')) its what he deserves"
"15209","Shazam was really really good. This was as good of a role fit for Zach Levi as Ryan Reynolds was with Deadpool"

"15213","@ZacharyLevi We just saw Shazam! What a fun movie! You totally rock as a superhero!"
"15214","Just saw #Shazam for the second time and this time with people in my theater (the first time there was maybe 6 total). First off it's still just as good the second time as it is the first. If you haven't seen it GO SEE IT. Second when you know who came out in the end my theater.."
"15215","@Signs2323 What's ironic is I saw someone complaining about spoilers earlier, yet their avi and profile photo we're the Shazam family... Which is a fucking spoiler! 

That being said.... I don't post spoilers, but I kinda figured the Cameo was already well known before the movie came out..."

"15218","@127_tony I think Shazam has a better story structure. Wonder Woman has undeniable charisma."
"15219","I'm pleasantly surprised by @ShazamMovie !!! The best DC movie in my opinion. Great plot mixed with an epic soundtrack automatically makes for an awesome movie. This was a great way to end the weekend:)"
"15220","@ZacharyLevi I saw Shazam yesterday and I scream and laugh a lot. As a depressed person I feel very happy like I never feel I'm my entire life. I just love it and I understand Billy so much. Thank u for being part of this. <U+0001F495>"
"15221","@xSuzyEx It’s so good. The heart of it really shines through. I can’t believe I am saying this but I’m tired of the gritty grimdark (anti)heroes, and Shazam was a welcome break from cynicism."
"15222","I saw Shazam today and I really liked it it was funny and just like nice"
"15223","@JohnnySobczak @AmazonChique ghostbusters had a box office return of 230 million. movies don’t go away after the first weekend.

also worth considering what shazam opened against... which is nothing as far as i can tell."
"15224","@BlackMajikMan90 @J_Friendly @JohnnySobczak @AmazonChique gb made 230 mil on a budget of 144. wasn’t a blowout but it turned a profit. it’s definitely odd that shazam didn’t have a giant weird hate campaign against it."
"15225","What it deserves"
"15226","@ShazamMovie was freaking awesome!!!! Nice job to everybody especially @ZacharyLevi!!! You rock!"
"15227","No good films have come out recently except superhero movies. I used to go to the theaters all the time but haven’t gone yet in 2019. Hollywood needs to get its act together. Is Shazam any good?"
"15228","@jpeaton36 @CDawsonAuthor @RTSnyderCut dude for real like I'm homering into the bushes I've been Zack-Pilled on our movement and I'm worried if the narrative was true, but the algorithm protected us good seeds until we were positive about #Shazam. Like WHOA."

Only DC movie I've seen in theaters too"

I'm breaking my Twitter hiatus to ask one question. Is 
@ZacharyLevi even real? Like wow <U+0001F60D>  but seriously, #Shazam was awesome and you should go see it! <U+26A1>"
"15234","Shazam! is a blast! So fun, with great humor and heart. It’s BIG as a superhero movie, and Zachary Levi is perfect in the role. Also features a foster family in cool ways (though warning, some scenes may be triggering if fostering or adoption is part of your story)."
"15235","@Cornerstone1973 @ShaquilleGMoore @DCComics @ShazamMovie The movie is still making back it's budget so I don't see the problem here"

"15252","So...Ive come to the Conlusion...That @ShazamMovie is The Best DC Movie Of all Times So much so that i am Changing My Persona From a Marvel Hero To DC so Suck it"
"15253","Shazam does humor and quips better than 80 percent of the MCU and counting some extras"

"15255","Jus finished Shazam. I love how DC do the fighting scenes. Pretty funny too."

If you’re keeping track at home I cried in this comic book movie. Keeping that cry ratio STRONG at 100%."
"15260","@TheRock is such a nerd and if @ZacharyLevi proved anything with Shazam!, it is that you always hire the nerds for these movies. Beyond excited not just for Black Adam, but also for his future in DC."

"15272","@BOLDLYBAILEYY i cried while watching shazam too and it’s not really emotional i was too emotional watching <U+0001F648>"
"15273","It's funny because Shazam! is basically the polar opposite of any Zack Snyder directed DC movie and not nearly as serious as Wonder Woman. Despite a cookie cutter plot and villain, the characters in Shazam! were intriguing enough to keep me invested the whole time. A fun time <U+0001F44D>"
"15274","Shazam was way better than captain marvel dam they should’ve just made a nova movie or wonder man to be honest <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"

"15279","@ZacharyLevi truly a good movie in @ShazamMovie !  Made my day and motivated me to keep on keeping on despite my student debt and to just always be positive."
"15280","@AmazonChique I really liked Ghost Busters.  Took my wife, and we both loved it. 

I honestly doubt we will like Shazam more."
"15281","Shazam!
Rating: 8.7

Loved it. Even if you don’t like superhero movies for some stupid reason, you’ll love the comedy and story line. Recommend."
"15282","Finally got to see @ShazamMovie tonight! Amazing! Another great move! @ZacharyLevi you rocked it! #shazam"
"15283","The Shazam movie was better than any of the past new DC movies that came out #ShazamMovie"
"15284","Watched @ShazamMovie with the family. Really enjoyed that! @ZacharyLevi was very funny (although I wouldn’t have expected any less)! Thanks for the entertaining family movie night! <U+0001F37F>"

"15286","@AmazonChique Shazam made more in a week in international box office than 2016 Ghostbusters did in its entire run"
"15287","Aaron: Ate, we’ll watch shazam today.

M: awwww I want to watch too!

Aaron: don’t worry, I’ll record it for you!

M: but that’s illegal, lüv

Aaron: oh no. yes okay so i’ll make kwento instead don’t worry. i’ll write notes, papa i’ll bring paper in the cinema!!!

too cute <U+0001F629><U+0001F629>"
"15288","Follow-up; Shazam was pretty fun and a solid offering. The audience I saw it with really loved it."
"15289","Then he turns into Sheldon Cooper <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"15290","@manishie_ @ShazamMovie Man of steel was Zack's mic drop. Hell of a film and a great Superman origin remake. Let's not forget during Justice League, his daughter committed suicide. He waited a few months before stepping down and handing it off to Whedon to finish. I'll agree that bvs was poop."
"15291","@manishie_ @ShazamMovie That and I think his contract with WB gives him first dibs at anything DC? I didn't check my facts on this one tho..."
"15292","how to spot a Queen fan during a screening of Shazam!:

they're freaking out when they hear Don't Stop Me Now playing and proceed to bop along. look out for their air-guitaring and air-drumming skills."

"15296","Yeah I know I should have finished  the taxes instead of seeing @ShazamMovie with my sons but not only was it a great movie but when I'm dead and gone they will remember going out together and talk about it to their kids.

I doubt the subject of me doing 2018 taxes will come up"
"15297","@WASDMitch That’s exactly what my wife and I have been saying. There’s nothing good on. We went and watched Shazam but it wasnt very good at all"
"15298","@MovieMarker @WarnerBrosEnt Fabulously generous #Shazam giveaway by those awesome peeps at #MovieMarker and #WarnerBrosEnt I've got my #FingersCrossed hope you all have too, good luck!"
"15299","SHAZAM! - 8/10
+Very Funny!!
+Love the casting w/ Zarchery Levi, Mark Strong and Jack Dylan Grazer. (And the whole foster family)
&gt;Decent Action Scenes
&gt;Interedted who they will weave Mr. Mind into the DCU
-Still pretty Dark (withe the 7 Deadly Sins)
Worth a Watch!!"
"15300","So did the writers for Shazam! watched The Dragon Prince too bc LMAO"
"15301","@l0ky86 is good movie, has a good script that is consistent and comes to have a similar dark moment like gremling, the comedy in its majority is more intelligent than other comedies  the humor is genuinely make you laugh. the tone is appropriate for Shazam and a superhero young ,"
"15302","Finally saw @ShazamMovie. So fun. So diverse and heartwarming. @ZacharyLevi is a damn gift to us all."
"15303","@Mickeysei34 Shazam and Aquaman should’ve swapped release dates"
"15304","@tonygoldmark It's a nice change of pace, especially with Shazam. 

Warner Bros is really breaking out from using Batman and Superman for their flicks."
"15305","SHAZAAYUMM ZADDY!!

Shazam is so SO GOOD. Please go watch the movie! I really wanna see more DC movies <U+0001F62B>"
"15306","I remember a time before Shazam where if you wanted to find a song you had to remember the lyrics and then look them up when you got home and then look up every song that showed up until you found the right one"
"15307","@filmguy619 Perfect example I'm a teenager my self and yesterday me and my friend went to see Shazam and after the movie these teens were having a food fight and spilled popcorn all over the floor (I work at the theater as well so i was pissed even though I didn't have to clean it)"
"15308","DCU movies are the worst superhero movies ever except:
1. Wonder Woman (best recent superhero movie ever)
2. Aquaman (meh)
3. Shazam (actually better than Wonder Woman.)"
"15309","Do NOT take your kids to see #Shazam! The trailer mentions nothing about the whole plot which involves the Seven deadly sins! Highly inappropriate!!!! #SevenDeadlySins #shazam #ShazamMovie #ridiculous"
"15310","Shazam! Was amazing... So much fun.

Also they made reference to Watch Dogs, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and many more.

I was happy that they built it properly;

It's a 9/10 without a doubt!"
"15311","@amazehayes_ Worse than Suicide Squad?  Havent’t watched it yet, but literally one decent joke would vault Shazam over that abomination of a movie."
"15312","Shazam is more to humor than superheroes lol"
"15313","@Timcast I'll have to check this show out. You hated Blade Runner and Alita and liked Shazam so you are the ultimate entertainment contra indicator.<U+0001F642>"
"15314","Finally got to see #Shazam !! Feel like I’ve been waiting my whole life to see that much of @ZacharyLevi on the big screens. Fucking incredible"
"15315","Which, yes, makes its use as the character introduction for Sivana in Shazam not only fitting, but the only appropriate soundtrack use it has ever been put to."
"15316","@xan_desanctis @DavidAFrench I'll give @DavidAFrench the Nolan trilogy (Nolan is possibly the master filmmaker of our generation, so...), but just about every DCEU movie since then has been quite bad (with the exception of WW, and now possibly Shazam which I haven't seen yet)"
"15317","when i was walking out of Shazam i heard someone say “wait DC actually made a good superhero movie?” and i felt that"
"15318","So watching Shazam with the kids at Eastwood. For a family movie, they showed 3 liquor ads and a horror movie trailer."
"15319","Captain Marvel film was fantastic. Highlighted plight of foster kids of all gender, race, abled &amp; disabled, different sizes, etc. Showed their struggles &amp; all as capable of being super heroes.

Sorry, I meant Shazam. The movie was Shazam. Amazing film!"
"15320","I loved Shazam! @ZacharyLevi is the hero we had no idea we wanted. I hope they make five million sequels!"
"15321","@ZacharyLevi I just saw Shazam and you just single-handedly redeemed the DCEU! You rocked my freaking socks!!!!!"
"15322","Shazam was very predictable but really FUNNY!"
"15323","My unfortunate review.
#SHAZAM is prob up there with #RyanReynolds #GreenLatern . <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44E>"
"15324","Do yourself a favor and watch Shazam you won’t be disappointed;)"
"15325","@Sharito742 @Mack46967496 @GiteshPandya Shazam flopped at the box office only 53mil? and 158mil WW. Most superhero movies do 158M domestically. #Shazam #CaptainMarvel"
"15326","Lmaooo. Thanks for this review,I can just sit my ass at home now"
"15327","Just got out of #PetSematary and well be reviewing both that and Shazam early this week! For Now I'll just say go see it!!!!  There were tears,  fear and a Butterfinger involved."
"15328","Wonder Woman. Aquaman a close second. Haven’t seen Shazam but it has to be better the MoS easily"
"15329","i just watched shazam and i loved it lol #Shazam #ShazamMovie"
"15330","@BobDigi69 @rhobhpolls @newsflxsh @Partizan_Niksic @ShazamMovie The Snyder cut was deemed unwatchable in its production. So stfu already."
"15331","If for some reason you didn’t see #Shazam this weekend, you need to see it. If you enjoy superhero movies and/or films that are fun, full of heart and humor and great characters, and are about family, this movie is for you!"
"15332","@Shadbase Yo shäd I got an idea for you, why don’t you do the Shazam family ,I mean c’mon they’re just itching for your lewdness <U+0001F480>"
"15333","i’m so glad shazam is doing well ): zachary deserves <U+0001F49C>"
"15334","did anyone else catch the part in shazam near the end where the reporter is speaking and in the background you see the guy in a gingerbread costume being wheeled into ambulance LMAO"
"15335","@ZacharyLevi Being born in 64’ I grew up with Shazam...I just walked out of the theater with a massive smile on my face, thrilled, excited &amp; thoroughly entertained.  The theater roared with laughter, as did I.  Anxious 4 what’s next. Thank U, it was awesome &amp; so we’re U.  Jen xxx"
"15336","@MeaganGood  thank you so much for being in Shazam! You did awesome and made the movie that much better! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB>"

"15338","@NousevaAngel I don’t even know why I make plans for AFTER #Wrestlemania anymore. 

Welp, Shazam will just have to wait until tomorrow"
"15339","Hubby off to see #Shazam. I'm staying home to watch this marathon #WrestleMania sad thing is that he'll be home before the main event"
"15340","@ZacharyLevi just watched Shazam and I have to say you are Chuck no more. You are and always will be Shazam (Captain Marvel)!!! #ShazamMovie"
"15341","Shazam was honestly a great movie! 10/10 would recommend <U+0001F44C>"
"15342","Shazam should be called captain marvel,captain marvel should be called ms marvel and the current Ms marvel shouldn't even exist because she's a genderswapped Mr fantastic"
"15343","congrats @ZacharyLevi !!!"
"15344","@ZacharyLevi This video is adorable!

I'm looking fwd to a 2 hr window in my schedule this week. Sneaking in to watch Shazam by myself. I'm gonna enjoy this! Popcorn all mine, baby!"
"15345","@kridentagg Yess! I loved Aquaman and Shazam. Very fun movies all around."
"15346","So I've loved @ZacharyLevi since the Chuck days and I saw #ShazamMovie today and omg I love him even more"
"15347","I am literally the only person in this theater and I am loving it. #Shazam"
"15348","@Huerta93Till I was confused until I remembered that Shazam is also Captain Marvel."
"15349","Shazam was amazing plz everyone go watch so we can have a sequel."
"15350","@ozymandiaszx @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher I generally liked it, though the third act sucked so bad. They are making one of the best movies ever, and then give it up for the boring Marvelish fight. It was cheesy and dumb, especially when his friends turn into Shazam"
"15351","@ZacharyLevi i just saw Shazam for the second time and i love it even more then i already did 10/10 definitely gonna see it again"
"15352","@ArtbyAthena1 I’m pretty sure it was supposed to show darkseid and green lantern would have been introduced, really did dig the flashback fight with the lantern and ancient Shazam though. But yeah, personally I think WB killed Sky’s daughter so they could bring in Wheddon but he is saboteur."
"15353","@swimethan @SHAAN87989064 @the_snarkmaster I’m not mad I’m laughing at it mate .If you say so lol.Same price tickets, people wanna see aquaman /ww but get a Shazam LOL.Keep losing your audience’s confidence in you,dc’s future films will be negatively affected too.Learn some business mate LOL."
"15354","Oh my god the #ShazamMovie was sooo good! And of course one of the best things about the movie is #ZacharyLevi <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F><U+0001F60B> Definitely getting this movie when it comes out"
"15355","I saw Shazam today and let me just say it's absolutely amazing and Zachary Levi is thicc"
"15356","As someone that prides himself on creating eye pleasing product displays, this is one helluva crappy toy display."
"15357","Well, Shazam isn’t actually that bad a movie. Pretty good."
"15358","I was convinced that @AsherAngel and @Maisie_Williams were related when I watched @ShazamMovie.  I even argued with my 16 year old and then learned they weren’t <U+0001F61E>"
"15359","Today:
SHAZAM, gin and tonics, installed a radio/CD player/sound system in a Jeep, gin and tonics, made Jamaican meat pies, gin and tonics, UNICORN STORE.

(Having SEKIRO withdrawls <U+0001F630> and need more drinks)"
"15360","Shazam was rel fun yes. Havent laughed so much for a superhero movie since Guardians one. Go see it!!"
"15361","@askmenfess SHAZAM!
reccomend"
"15362","That $5 Tuesday movies looking real goodt rn. Need to see Us &amp; Shazam"
"15363","I actually got a voice mail from God.

He told me “Hey Fadel what’s poppin’ my dude? Hey listen, could u tell people if they liked Shazam, I’m sending them to hell? Thx. PS : Bro, we don’t talk much, we should hang out sometime”"
"15364","Finally watched Shazam and i loved it lots! It's so fun and funny, this is what dc should be aiming at, tbh."
"15365","@ZacharyLevi when is #shazam 2 coming?? <U+0001F602><U+0001F60F><U+0001F60F><U+0001F60F><U+0001F60F><U+0001F643><U+0001F643><U+0001F61B>"
"15366","@ZacharyLevi #SHAZAM 3 times and counting.."
"15367","@katiebelle13 FWIW, I saw Shazam last night and had a blast. It’s actiony and funny and dark and sweet at times. I haven’t seen any of the DC films outside of Wonder Woman, but it was really well done. It seems to be a standalone, not part of the universe."
"15368","@ShaBatPrince @AqeelDC @CescoGorno @ShaBatPrince Now that Shazam is done next solo is WW84 next yr that returns Gal as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman."
"15369","Usually don't announce in advance what I'm covering on Soundtrack-Universe, but this week... why not?

Tuesday (4/9/19)- #PetSematary (Young)
Friday (4/12/19)- #Shazam (Wallfisch)"
"15370","It's surprisingly great. I loved ittttt @ShazamMovie"
"15371","btw. shazam is an awesome movie. although i felt part of the end was dragged out a bit but overall really funny &amp; production was excellent.. 7/10 or something close to 8."
"15372","Shazam! is a good movie! I recommend it!"
"15373","@polluxdioscuros @dcumoviepage @TheDCEUScene @UniversoDCnauta @DCEUPosts @DCFUnited @theshazamcast @ShazamMovie @GeorgiosMits @wbpictures @dcfilmstalk Awwww, thank you so much!"
"15374","I have some things to say about Shazam"
"15375","@CDonScouting @amazehayes_ I thought shazam was one of the better DC movies, adapted source material well, good acting some funny jokes/scenes."
"15376","Also, shout out to WB/DC for marketing Shazam so well without spoiling everything. Some movie studios need to take notes. There was so much in the movie that would’ve been great marketing material, but I’m glad they kept it for the movie."
"15377","@liesann_ @btsvotingteam @BTS_twt Yes finally i was able to vote more than once! You can use several accts. Don't forget to go to their APP and delete storage (similar to Shazam) and back to login."
"15378","I recommend watching the movie Shazam probably best DC movie I ever watched <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>"
"15379","@cureric @ynapoles4 @malachitemoi we watching shazam <U+0001F621>"
"15380","tf is that"
"15381","""Shazam"" and ""Spider-Man"" are good because all superhero movies should be made for and about 15 year olds."
"15382","just saying: sony australia = more promo = more radio play = more people hearing their songs = more Shazam’s = more interest = more fans = more exposure = more noticing bts in australia"
"15383","saw and really enjoyed Shazam! (exclamation point is part of the title) I liked it a lot! little to no spoilers, it had a lot of the captain marvel stuff I really like, and ALSO, MORE IMPORTANTLY, it actually had my pie in the sky joke demand from when I sat down to watch it"
"15384","seen #ShazamMovie  tonight I definitely have just became a @DCComics  fan after tonight for sure <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FE> ."
"15385","I get the distinct impression Sivana is gonna be the main thing I disagree with everyone on about Shazam"
"15386","@ShazamMovie was actually pretty hilarious once it really got started"
"15387","Just got back from #Shazam with @lapinstein! Was a good movie. Lots of chuckles. The end credit animation was great too"
"15388","@iamgayash Wonder women and Aquaman both and Shazam is good too.. base on the actor I'm assuming Joker will be good too. <U+0001F60C>"
"15389","I really wanted to like #Shazam but man I just didn’t. It wasn’t terrible it just felt off."
"15390","@ZacharyLevi Hey Zach #ShazamMovie was so much fun <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> Will see again!!! How’s it like to have super powers now? Comparable to @TheRock?"
"15391","@ZacharyLevi Hey Zach #ShazamMovie was so much fun <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> Will see again!!! How’s it like to have super powers now? Comparable to @TheRock"
"15392","@DaWillstanator @ActorKatieP Went and saw the movie ""Shazam!"" Gotta say this movie is pretty much the only DC movie I'm ever interested in it has plenty of humour and it's very very funny go and see it I highly recommend it you'll have fun"
"15393","Saw #Shazam for the second time,  when the credits rolled this 7 year old girl got up and started headbashing to the music with one of these <U+0001F918><U+0001F3FD> up while her mom stared hilariously lmao. Ya dun good @ZacharyLevi @ponysmasher"
"15394","I was worried DC only got lucky with Wonder Woman, but with Aquaman actually being a solid movie and Shazam embracing the more childlike glee of comic books, I actually have hope for them now."
"15395","@aRJayX Defiantly Captain Marvel at best is an average flick sandwhiched between a Great film #Shazam and a Legendary cinematic event #endgame"
"15396","There is nothing better than your ""angry"" face in SHAZAM. Like every kid's anger face, it's kinda constipated and looking like you are wearing your anger on your sleeve. Has to be my favorite look right now.  Really enjoyed your performance!!!  @ZacharyLevi"
"15397","@The_Orange_Bull My theory after watching Shazam! is that they still rely too heavily upon tropes from the 90s to drive major plot points and character arcs. Good chunks of the movies just seem *dated* and lazy."
"15398","So, Shazam! was okay. There were parts I *hated*, and some parts I *loved*. My DC ranking is now Wonder Woman, Shazam!, and Aquaman. (The others don't deserve ranking.) DC movies are so frustrating for me, though, as they come sooooo close to being great and then fuck it up."
"15399","Just finished with #Shazam, @ZacharyLevi just freaking nailed Shazam. Thank you @ponysmasher and @DCComics."
"15400","The biggest lesson Shazam taught me is that I was completely wrong about where Philadelphia is."
"15401","#SHAZAM has fantastic action, a great villain. Top notch VFX and heart. This film has so much damn heart. The Foster family and the message about how a good family gives you strength, confidence and morality is spot on and perfect for the times. See it in IMAX if possible. Wowza!"
"15402","#SHAZAM! Was AMAZING! @ZacharyLevi SHINED!! But I think it was @smugorange that absolutely stole the movie for me!! Every scene he was in was incredible! So much heart and so much care for the foster family. Powerful, moving, and all around brilliant!"
"15403","Imagine not being able to pull off a movie starring Superman and Batman, two of the most popular characters in all of fiction, but somehow nailing Shazam."
"15404","hey its me promoting shazam to my irl friends to see the movie in theaters!"
"15405","@ZacharyLevi I find this movie unique &amp; interesting. It's not so serious or dark. It's funny, light, beautiful lessons of a hero's journey, easter eggs, &amp; well written script. Shazam is the only DC movie I didn't walk out of theatre. Interesting end credit. Can't wait 4 Shazam 2."
"15406","@ZacharyLevi I've loved Shazam. You're the best"
"15407","@ZacharyLevi I have loved Shazam. You're the best"
"15408","@ZacharyLevi Well, just came back from the theater, Went to watch #Shazam Yo, my dude, @ZacharyLevi nailed it. Best DC movie since Batman Dark Knight Rises. Congrats. Recommended. Go watch it"
"15409","Saw Shazam on Thursday! LOVED IT! @ZacharyLevi was so underrated for so long and I’m so happy he’s finally getting the recognition he deserves!It’s been so amazing watching Levi grow as an actor all these years, from my 2009 crush on him, to Flynn, to Fandral, &amp; now Shazam!<U+0001F49B><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+2728>"
"15410","@ShazamMovie was phenomenal! @jackdgrazer, @AsherAngel, and @ZacharyLevi are fantastic in it!
I can't recommend it enough. 

#ShazamMovie #Shazam"
"15411","First of all, really loved #SHAZAM it was a great movie.  When the credits started I turned around and the lady behind me was crocheting the entire movie.  I found that interesting <U+0001F605>"
"15412","Are you kidding me, @ZacharyLevi ??! You Shazammed it out of the park! Me &amp; my kiddos loved the movie!"
"15413","@_diana_nicole @GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Yeah I seen it earlier, I seriously laughed the whole movie and I'm going to take my sons to see it on Saturday"
"15414","@Juanito011 That sucks but have you seen Shazam?? I seen it earlier"
"15415","@GalGadot @_diana_nicole @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Have you seen it yet?"
"15416","@alwaysaleec Remember in Shazam when they run over the crippled kid then get out of the car and start beating his ass"
"15417","I couldn't even make it through Shazam without having to go pee. How am I supposed to make it through endgame??"
"15418","see @wbpictures , what have you done....... #ReleaseTheSnyderCut @RTSnyderCut"
"15419","@IfyNwadiwe This is what Shazam is gonna say when Endgame comes out."
"15420","Watched #Shazam at @cineworld in Watford today loved it! And can I also say the customer service was amazing! Love an equal opportunities employer like Cineworld, more businesses should follow suit! <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FC>#employmentforall #cineworld"
"15421","I watched Shazam tonight, but I am reluctant to give my opinion of it, because I feel that it was tainted by the bad server experience I had at @alamodrafthouse in Tempe. I’ll have to watch it again to give a fair review. (Someplace else, obviously.)"
"15422","i’d like to personally thank IT and andi mack stans for contributing to shazam’s success"
"15423","@jennifer_jeka12 @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie YES!!! THE most amazing part of all this. I'm so so proud. I cried on the theater. Hes gigantic on screen. When I first heard his familiar voice... oh my God!"
"15424","Anyways Shazam owns my ass, Grace Fulton owns my ass, Zachary Levi owns my ass."
"15425","@RealJohnGlover @michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi I still have no idea how such a sweet man can pull off playing such despicable characters so well"
"15426","this is so cute uwu"
"15427","Shazam is the most incredible movie to date it's not only heartfelt but has such a strong message and i think we need more of that in today. And not to mention @ZacharyLevi was made for this role I've never felt so much joy as i did watching the film <U+2764>"
"15428","@PetrNeniBorec Disappointed that there is no tawky tawny in shazam ....May be they will add him in the sequel ...shazam family with tawky tawny battling monster society of evil in one of the seven realms ...that would be epic"
"15429","Shazam doesn't break new ground or change the comic-film game by any stretch - it doesn't need to. It's just good-natured fun with a lot of heart at its core. It's good. Really good. 

Go watch it."
"15430","The kid from IT and Shazam has better comic timing than most adults. It's insane."
"15431","@ShazamMovie is probably my favorite DC Universe movie yet. They picked a tone that worked and nailed it. I laugh, I cheered. The Big Red Cheese really landed it."
"15432","DC gave us a Doomsday surprise fight in BvS...he would’ve been so much better off as the primary antagonist for a Man of Steel sequel"
"15433","Black Adam is EGYPTIAN. Please DO NOT over popularize it with @TheRock playing this character as it de-symbolizes culture and takes away from Middle Eastern native artists &amp; entertainers. @DCComics @TheDCUniverse do the right thing! #BlackAdam #Shazam #DCComics"
"15434","@DeletedJoe_ I ALWAYS go into DC movies with EXTREMELY LOW EXPECTATIONS, walked into suicide squad with low expectations and some how still came out disappointed.. Shazam changed my view real quick, if DC makes more movies like Shazam theres a shocking future for the DCEU."
"15435","@KwingReviews Wouldn't compare them cus they are different but comic wise her film isn't the but the best comic film of all time but not the worst either. I liked about as much as I liked Shazam. I've seen much worse comic films."
"15436","@verycoolemily Shazam is so good it makes Solo look like Batman and Robin."
"15437","The hype is real, pretty sure Shazam just became my all time fav superhero movie."
"15438","With everything he’s done leading up to #Shazam, and everything he’s doing now, @ZacharyLevi is both a superhero on AND off the screen. Super happy for this man, he absolutely deserves everything that has come about. Here’s to a even brighter future <U+0001F91F><U+0001F3FB>"

"15442","@CBMCringe Everybody is allowed to have their opinion. Cuz that’s all any of this is. I think SHAZAM was amazing. But every #DCEU movie has been, except for that deformity so hateful to sight and memory."

"15445","Though it doesn’t quite reach the heights of its Marvel counterparts, #Shazam is a great DC film with tremendous heart, a solid cast, and touching themes of family and belonging. The DCEU is seemingly back on track. Grade: A-"
"15446","my spoiler free review of shazam is that i love riverdale and the oc"
"15447","I watched Shazam this past weekend and it has to be my favorite DC movie by far. @ZacharyLevi did an amazing job as Shazam, so much spark into the character he made. Loved it. (Ps I loved you in Chuck and you look amazingly fit in the Shazam suit)"
"15448","After seeing #Shazam I think I and a lot of people I know will agree #FreddyFreeman is my spirit animal"
"15449","Why did it take DC so long to make a good movie, were the other hundred literally just practice? #shazam"
"15450","@ZacharyLevi saw #Shazam for my birthday and the lightheartedness and seriousness you brought to the film is absolutely perfect."
"15451","Watching Shazam at Alamanda today and a disgusting couple doing “shazam” next to me. GET A ROOM!!!!!!! (If you’re in a Halal relationship. Not that young looking anyway <U+0001F644>)"
"15452","#ShazamMovie  was the best DC movie of the dceu era(which I know sounds like a diss but it's not). I'm not going to hate watch it the second and third time like the others #progress"
"15453","anyways Shazam only plays like 20 seconds of Legend, she doesn’t deserve this"
"15454","Go to sleep"
"15455","I wanted to love SHAZAM, but wound up lukewarm. Enjoyed the Raimi-esque cheese, but the movie is mostly still superhero monotony; none of it goes far enough to be parody or satire. Jarring editing, distractingly bad VFX, TV-movie cinematography. Jack Dylan Grazer is great though."
"15456","#Shazam was undersold by its advertising. It's much more than the cringe worthy teenage boy movie it was made out to be. Okay, there is a lot of Warner *Bros* in there, but had some good (mostly male) story. Hoping a 2nd movie makes the adult part of SHAZAM more likable though"
"15457","@ZacharyLevi @ZacharyLevi Our family saw Shazam! on Friday night and absolutely loved it.  I want to see it again, because I had such a good time.  Once was definitely not enough! Everyone did a fantastic job!"
"15458","I do feel like I should add @ZacharyLevi in on this, too.
A great job as In Shazam. And (because my sequel loving film is one of he most important things to me) an absolute favourite for my little one. 
She’s gonna be yelling Shazam for a long time because of you! Thank you."
"15459","Same goes to @starryguys.
I went in pre-angry at #PetSematary (yes, I’m one of those, sorry) and came out delighted.
Round two this week. I can’t wait to see it again."
"15460","Massive congrats to @ponysmasher on #Shazam’s debut.
Such a fun film &amp; deserves attention.
My kid spent yesterday afternoon jumping around yelling “SHAZAM!” &amp; singing “lightning from my hands!”
Isn’t that what films are all about?

Oh, she’s a horror kid. And loved your monsters."
"15461","@ZacharyLevi I watched #SHAZAM yesterday afternoon and this morning and regret nothing. This movie is great family fun &amp; full of laughs.

"15463","Also, I loved Shazam for the simple fact that it’s the one honest superhero movie I’ve seen in a very long time. Humans, in general would all take advantage and take it for granted in the beginning and I loved that y’all portrayed it as such."
"15464","Saw Shazam alone and snuck a sandwich into the theater because I am very single and very hungry!!!"
"15465","@ZineAFC Honestly, I loved it, it had me laughing throughout most of it and it really worked. It’s so crazy to me where I live in a world that a justice league movie didn’t work, but a stand-alone Shazam movie starring Chuck did lmao"
"15466","@ZacharyLevi You blew me away as Shazam. I can’t believe how GOOD this movie was, you’re perfect, oh so perfect in it! Can’t wait to see it many more times."
"15467","I’m so happy my husband dragged me to see Shazam, I forgot how much I love @ZacharyLevi !!"

"15470","The awkward moment when Shazam was a better Justice League movie than well... the Justice League."
"15471","Shazam is the most wholesome DC movie to date. It's funny, witty and not to mention so intelligently written. Not once during the movie was I wondering if the end was near because of how well paced it is. Shazam is the movie the DC universe was dying for."
"15472","@DCComics @ShazamMovie The movie is unexpectedly great! Whole family fun and excitement is all you get -- Shazam did not disappoint <U+0001F44C>"
"15473","I wanna see us, pet cemetery, and Shazam at the damn cinemas"
"15474","Congratulations to director David F. Sandberg @ponysmasher on his new hit film 'Shazam!' @ShazamMovie"
"15475","#Shazam was a Shazam as fuck movie. There is not a single person going into that movie looking for Shazam and walking out unsatisfied. What's weird are the people who went into it apparently looking for something else."
"15476","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Lead our universe into greatness... please!"
"15477","Shazam second viewing today! So excited to see the adorable foster kids again."
"15478","Seeing a ton of positive reviews on Shazam .. which is great... EXCEPT that they all refer Jack Dylan Grazer as “that kid from IT”. 
He has a name. IMDb and Google are user friendly. If you’re going to brag on his great talent than don’t marginalize him as “that kid”."
"15479","why would anyone go see a movie called Shazam tho? Lol"
"15480","@AngryJoeShow Going to see Shazam next week but as of now my rankings are ( get ready for some controversy)
1. Batman v Superman 
2. Wonder Woman 
3. Aquaman

6. Justice League"

"15482","#facts HE'S BACK. #Shazam review coming soon #NACK."
"15483","#Shazam is just not funny. It's not as entertaining as it should be. Maybe I just don't get the jokes but it's like they tried making a disney movie but it lacked the magic. Darla is my standout. I prefer the dark DC films. #watchout #allidoisbinge"
"15484","i’m crying— Lex and Lionel ily"

"15486","i had a big day. i went to minmed. i talked to my landlord. i saw shazam with my cis friends. i am home now and so tired. i ordered pizza luce. i had a cupon. i am so tired"
"15487","@ShazamMovie is excellent. One of the funnier films so far this year!"
"15488","@KarissaWeiler I know that, I knew Shazam as Captain Marvel and refuse to call him Shazam. That's what makes DC Universe vs Mortal Kombat worth the replay to call Captain Marvel by his name. I'm that kind of person, a Joker."
"15489","@ZacharyLevi Took my boys to watch Shazam. Absolutely loved it. Great movie!"
"15490","@grayghost84 @wbpictures You're very passionate &amp; that's obvious. I <U+2764> #Shazam but I don't compare it to #ManofSteel or #BatmanvSuperman. How could i? This was the perfect 1st outing 4 Shazam. There will be plenty of opportunities to see him in more serious roles within the #DCEU . #ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"15491","I’m so glad @wbpictures understand that all we ever wanted was a body double of Henry Cavill in Shazam <U+0001F644>
#ReleaseTheSnyderCut"
"15492","If you were Cavill would you:

1] Cameo in Shazam, generate box office for a Shazam2 before you got a MOS2?

2] Not Cameo in Shazam, and hold out for a MOS2, so he doesn't get dumped after doing a cameo?

Oh and #ReleaseTheSnyderCut so we can solve Cavill's face once and for all"
"15493","A friend asked us to watch their kiddos so they could see Shazam!. We spent today watching a lot of Bubble Guppies, and playing with a ladybug which eventually fell off Nate’s hand and onto the ground where their dog stepped on it, then laid on top of it.  It was a fun day!"
"15494","Shazam was actually pretty good I’m not gonna lie. But, it’s still not on marvel’s level"
"15495","@akaTheRenegade His manager is the same as The Rock manager , yesterday the rock announced Black Adam movie , she is also a producer in the Shazam movie. She just wanted Cavil to be paid more"
"15496","@stargazer0118 Henry didn’t post anything about Shazam <U+0001F914> I hope things are okay but it’s just feels weird at this point"

"15499","Time to hoard Shazam comics now please watch Shazam now in theaters also follow @SEN1227 for their awesome Shazam artworks"
"15500","coolest scenes in Shazam:
- Billy Shazaming off a roof
- That shot that looked like an Alex Ross painting YOU KNOW THE ONE"
"15501","I honestly had no expectations for shazam but it surprisingly really good. Thumbs up to DC for this one"
"15502",".@ShazamMovie was sincerely one of the best superhero movies I’ve ever seen—and one of the best I’ve seen, period. The foster family exuded a portrait we never see in tentpoles with care but blockbuster elan. Bravo."
"15503","Shazam might be a top 5 superhero movie man. Shits just fucking awesome."
"15504","Sounds like the reviews are pretty good for #WreslteMania and sounds like reviews are AWESOME for #Shazam"
"15505","wow david sandberg went from directing Lights Out and Annabelle the creation to Shazam!, that versatility tho <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F> definitely gonna look out for his upcoming movies"
"15506","i wish there’s an app like shazam but for people instead of music,,,"
"15507","Hoping Henry returns to the role soon, but thought here, if DCEU is going full steam in the Shazamverse (at least 3 movies deep, it seems), then maybe to not under cut Shazam’s “ thunder “ they maybe put Supes on ice for a bit..."
"15508","@TheRadicalJawa SHAZAM excluded no one and welcomed everyone. True diversity is acceptance without comment. There is no tokenism, each character has a unique personality. And no pandering with the fake “look how. diverse we are” garbage. And no Identity Sword used to scold anybody. Great film."
"15509","my friend chose captain marvel over shazam for this week and now I'm mad"
"15510","I really want to watch Shazam!"
"15511","#ShazamMovie is a top tier movie perfect marketing and perfect ending. Amazing"
"15512","@ZacharyLevi shazam rock!not been out by myslef due to illness for years but did to see the film and have not laugh and smile so much in along time"
"15513","Just got out of seeing #Shazam and it was better than I thought it would be"
"15514","@VanAllenPlexico @kamandi68 In recent years he’s been changed some to try to differentiate him from Superman. Lightning powers, etc. I was dreading this movie when it was announced but the trailers looked good, so I got excited for it. I got big grin when Billy leaps from the building and yells Shazam!"
"15515","@amzingspidergub @ZacharyLevi ugh

quoting Shazam! is what i like to see"
"15516","just got home, saw Shazam! and it was the best fucking superhero movie I've seen in my life oh my GOD"
"15517","Well, after Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam, maybe DC finally figured out how to make good movies"
"15518","This right here! Shazam incorporated diversity properly without making it feel forced."
"15519","Meh I could’ve just watched Shazam on a 1080p copy instead of spending money lol."
"15520","The kid and Shazam’s personality are so inconsistent that it’s annoying. He’s edgy as a kid but he dances giddily as Shazam???"
"15521","Best movie I’ve seen, honestly. #ShazamMovie I’m hoping Endgame and Spider-Man will be just as good but.... Marvel has kinda been a disappointment, while DC is just climbing!!<U+0001F44C><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

"15524","@ZacharyLevi @_joshpray Man, I just love your energy!!! You got a face I want to hang out with. 
Zachary, thanks for bringing to life a character that I've dug for years. You embodied the buff Shazam I love most, artist Don Newton's. Bring on the sequel - and Black Adam, for goodness sake!!"
"15525","Whispers the softest ‘shazam’ and aims a low voltage lighting bolt at his hand right before he catches the ball.

"15528","Shazam got all the powers of Superman and his whole family got them powers like why? Who needs all that?"
"15529","Absloutley loved @ShazamMovie! Kudos to @ponysmasher for creating a superhero film that is full of heart &amp; so fun to watch! Here's hoping #Shazam stands as a reminder that not all superheroes need to be dark &amp; brooding &amp; that humerous comic book movies can pack a powerful punch!"

"15536","#Shazam was terrific fun but we’re confused about that Certain Cameo &amp; why a Certain Superhero wasn’t *actually* there since his manager is one of the exec producers (cough @DanyGarciaCo cough) but yeah, go see it, especially since it has

"15541","I just got back from seeing #Shazam and my biggest take away was how great the score was! @benwallfisch was really able to channel a classic, John Williams-esque grandeur to it. It’s great to see a super hero film with that heroic fanfare accompanying it!"

"15543","shazam is definitely one of the best superhero movies i’ve ever seen. and i’ve seen A LOT."

"15547","@FunkyColdCuban Shazam used to be called ""Captain Marvel"".

So you're 100% right in everything you said."

"15549","well deserved and it should be higher <U+0001F624>"

#SHAZAM"
"15556","What's sad to me is how little time #Shazam will have to get any traction, financially or otherwise,  before the behemoth that is Avengers: Endgame releases in theatres. Shazam is genuinely the most fun and heart warming superhero movie in a long time..."
"15557","@jemelehill I guess shouting Shazam didn’t work for him"
"15558","@AmazonChique it's the overall ending box office numbers for Ghostbusters that made it a flop, plus it's budget was well over $100 million while Shazam's is $93 million

Plus #Shazam has made almost as much in it's opening weekend as Ghostbusters 2016 made it's entire run"
"15559","@QWallyWest Anything going aganist Endgame was suicide. But it was detestable if Disney to release the final trailer and open ticket orders up during Shazams week 1. If Shazam opened earlier it might have rode the Aquaman Wave. Or timing it for the Christmas season might have paid off more."
"15560","While #Shazam is a far superior film then #CaptainMavel &amp; will become a beloved classic. Its theatrical run is introuble. It didnt help that Disney began promoting Endgame during Shazams opening weekend either. WB shouldve released #ShazamMovie in Febuary or Dec, instead of April"
"15561","@MAN_OF_STEEL102 @logan_wilson93 Disney did the same stunt before though to DC when they started promoting Civil War during BVS week 1. Because the House of Mouse plays dirty. Still Batman was able to help carry that film, for a bit. Shazam is on his own. Marvel couldve waited till Monday, that was just evil."
"15562","This is great."

"15592","@Ssaaee1237676 @Josh2Gud4U @lexluthox #Aquaman &amp; #Shazam continue the tradition, Snyder started of making these heroes people first, super second.

"15593","@Ssaaee1237676 @lexluthox @Blu_Soldier001 @Josh2Gud4U I couldn't believe how serious #Shazam was. There was humor, especially some very quotable lines &amp; laugh out loud moments, but the overall tone of the film was very serious. I'd compare the tone to ""Willow""."
"15594","Be warned. If you maliciously post #Shazam spoilers to spite the film because you care more about satisfying your self serving rage driven agenda than you do about @ponysmasher, @ZacharyLevi, @ZackSnyder or #SnydersUniverse I will report you. 1"

"15608","#Shazam is a good enough origin story that sadly lacks any originality. Nice effort by the actors who have to work with a fairly standard script. 6/10."
"15609","SHAZAM did one thing that I think a lot of other superhero movies are afraid of doing, which is mentioning their own universe. Were not afraid at all to be in that existence."

i mean obviously the film wasnt perfect, i wish they would have gone with the humanized version of the sins, i mean i LOVE monsters but these ones looked a little cheesy, also tawky tawny? are they gonna go anywhere with him?"
"15613","guys im just... i ..... i just love .. it was such an easy, feel good movie and i love shazam so much, i remember my digital art teacher in high school was like ""ive always wanted to get into comics"" and i basically forced him to read every comic i had that involved shazam lol"
"15614","I didn’t expect SHAZAM to be that good but dam that movie was really good. 9.5/10 <U+0001F525>"
"15615","I didn’t see that coming @ponysmasher. The Last 50 minutes was intense and funny. I know there would be a suprise. But I didn’t know it will be a goosebump surprise. @ZacharyLevi <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> I’m going to see it again and again because of you. #Shazam #ShazamingtheWorld"

"15618","shazam was so awesome! i've already seen it twice and i want to see it again! the cast and everyone who worked on the movie did an amazing job! thanks for making this movie something i'll never forget <U+2764> @ZacharyLevi @Jgrazerofficial @AsherAngel @ShazamMovie"
"15619","Dare I say it? @DCComics is actually on a good path after that trainwreck of a Justice League film. Shazam and Aquaman were both incredibly enjoyable and show that DC desperately needed some of the humor back. Oh, and good directors too. They finally got those as well :P"
"15620","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Well this is absolutely adorable.. <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"15621","Please @TheDCUniverse stop making movies. #Shazam <U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FB>"
"15622","Can we all praise the fact that @ZacharyLevi was fun as Adult Billy Batson/Shazam in Shazam?"
"15623","before i go to sleep i gotta say shazam is rlly good and y’all should go see it ok gn"
"15624","“Avengers: Endgame” is going to wipe its, um ... nose with a $53.5 million bill."
"15625","Am I the only one who thought  #Shazam should have been released in Christmas time?? It's totally a Christmas movie. My heart is full of joy and love for this movie. Had such a good time. DC, this is what we want. Movies with great story arcs and character development."
"15626","Man this DC thing is a mess
First Snyder was in charge then gets fired bc of BvS
Then wb hired geoff johns and jon berg. Green lits Shazam, aquaman And Wonder Woman 84
Geoff gets fired bc of the failure of JL
WB gets the Walter Hamada things he green lits are joker BoP &amp; trench"
"15627","@ShavedSheev_ @dailyspiidey I agree with him to an extent but no matter how similar a movie is doesn’t make it bad. It doesn’t matter, what matters is them capitalizing on what makes that film unique, which is the weirdness of Shazam’s world and the themes of family and combination of horror and humor"
"15628","Sucks that Geoff And Berg was fired 
Him and berg was the reason why Shazam and aquaman were successes 
But they couldn’t save the Train wreck that was JL and WB gave them the boot 
Now Walter is the one taking credit of aquaman and Shazam."
"15629","@dailyspiidey I wouldn’t say Shazam is that mvoies. Thor 3 is that movie"
"15630","@FiZzLEJH @dailyspiidey I love HC and at times more than Rami stuff, but Shazam isn’t horrible. They actually explored the Sivvanah’s childhood which is something you never saw with the Vulture."

"15633","@RealJohnGlover @michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @realjohnglover how awesome was it to see you in Shazam tho! got a little Smallville vibe when I saw you <U+0001F602>"
"15634","Shazam was 7/10. I’d never think in a million years DC would beat Marvel in the movie category but here we are."
"15635","It’s not as intellectually insulting as Aquaman, and it doesn’t dishonestly pull it’s punches the way Wonder Woman does. #SHAZAM"
"15636","@smilingldsgirl @kirkneverdied I think we've been spoiled with super hero films opening to such huge numbers ( Even Venom! Lol) and we think now if they aren't opening 80 or higher it must be a failure. #SHAZAM is doing great and I hope to see it doing even better in the coming weeks."
"15637","@smilingldsgirl @kirkneverdied 1. Not many people Know Shazam
2. DC has got a long way to go for people to trust their brand. But it ain't good enough to do Dr.Strange numbers.
3. There aren't any big name actors to draw a crowd. 
I honestly believe those are your MAIN reason why Shazam didn't open higher."
"15638","Hey @ZacharyLevi I repeat, I’m so obsessed with #SHAZAM"

"15643","I watched Shazam and enjoyed it.. it was funny and that was enough to keep one interested."
"15644","@codekoan @LuminaOrchis @AmazonChique It's weird to give a movie with a budget a little over half the size and much less of a marketing budget credit for outperforming a more heavily marketed and expensive movie? Okay then.
Let's also not pretend that even HALF as many people knew Shazam as knew GB before now."

"15650","@Pirzaadi I think I got asked on a date twice in the past week by the same man. Apparently I didn’t know that his “do you want to go out for a coffee and talk and discuss” and “movie per chalna hai. Shazam! Dekhnay?” I didn’t know he was asking me out. My bf shoved sense into me -_-,"
"15651","@ZacharyLevi Drove 3 hours. Watched Shazam. Loved it. Drove home. Amazing day"

"15653","@Chevindu @ZacharyLevi Well, to be honest, I feel a bit of a fraud for one of them given that I didn't even realise that I'd drawn the first Talos appearance. 
 But Shazam! is so close to my heart that it gives me a huge warm feeling."
"15654","Just got home after seeing #Shazam. F-ing loved it! Glad my kid loves @ZacharyLevi and made us go!!"
"15655","Gotta Say I think My Favorite Part of Shazam is when Billy is being chased by the bad guy in the wizards Liar and he tells his family to hide. However they enter a group of doors. And One of them says to Think of a way out. And He does only to end up in a strip club. XD Lmao."

"15671","@BlakeOlivia Yup. All of what you said. I gave Shazam an 8.5/10 despite my dislike of the ending. The latter is my own hangup as a fan. It has nothing to do with Sandberg or the great film he made. Gotta be able to separate those two."

I've watched the movie Shazam 3 times in 3 different theatres and in non did I find a cup, that cup is AWESOME!!
Donde lo compraste?? @al_chio"
"15688","not going to lie I went in the theater to Captain marvel but there was a change of plans and I’m glad for. Honestly my new favorite movie and I can’t wait for the sequel!!!! #Shazam"
"15689","This man is hilarious."
"15690","i finally watched Shazam and well adam brody finally came out of his cave huh"
"15691","Re #ShazamMovie You have to stay till the end, there are 2 after credits scenes. Also some say all the good bits were in the trailers, not true, there's enough stuff there that's not in the trailers. Go watch it you won't regret it."
"15692","I think I might prefer #Shazam to any other film I've seen in theatres this year. It just feels like it's got so much heart and care put in to it. I think this one may need a second viewing!"
"15693","going to see @ZacharyLevi in #shazam for the second time and i’m wondering if, franchises aside, he’d like to team up with spider-man"
"15694","but with him (Asher Angel) already being presumably 15-16 years old right now they basically would have to begin preproduction on Shazam! 2 almost immediately assuming Shazam! does prove to be a financial success and they (Warner Bros.) do in fact decide to green light a sequel"
"15695","(again, in my opinion) as they essentially then could almost be classified as already on the cusp of young adulthood at that point but the question still remains, will DC and Warner Bros. actually decide to do that? All I know is I sure hope so because I genuinely enjoyed Shazam!"
"15696","(possibly 2-3 years) because I feel like one of the things that always had me so fascinated with the character of Shazam! and why he was probably my favorite DC superhero all these years was because I think it’s such a cool and unique idea to have a child gain these superpowers"
"15697","But all and all, all nitpicking aside, I absolutely LOVED and thoroughly enjoyed the film! #Shazam!<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"15698","omg flynn rider responded to my cousin i guess that means i have to watch shazam"
"15699","@MrHailZeon I really wanna see Static Shock get a movie especially after seeing them doing great with Aquaman and Shazam."
"15700","@ZacharyLevi Is that where this cup is hanging out?? I have been on the hunt for it and your Shazam @OriginalFunko , but all the places I go are out <U+0001F629>!

"15701","So DC and Joy split up years ago, and none of us can exactly remember why (I mean... they were so good together, after all).

luckily, #shazam is the party where you get to see them hook back up."
"15702","Saw SHAZAM! today. As a longtime fan of the original Captain Marvel, I found the movie a near perfect blend of golden age whimsy and modern sensibility and humor. Also, it's the most positive look at foster families in a while."
"15703","@JerryOrdway @BlueMoonBrewCo SHAZAM! had everything, including the Ramones covering Tom Waits!"
"15704","Shazam was decent. Kinda slow at parts and I knew the “twist” I guess from a toy, but it ended really fun"
"15705","just saw @ShazamMovie! such a great movie <U+2764><U+FE0F> almost cried a few times, haha. @ZacharyLevi you deserve everything good that’s coming your way. you’re amazing!

"15710","why is ""outfunning"" Marvel the objective

please DC don't listen to these people, keep making tonally diverse movies, including tones like those from The Joker, MoS, BvS, and WW"
"15711","@billyrust Captain Marvel &amp; Shazam are in different sub-genres IMO. Hard to compare in that way. 

For straight up superhero movie, Marvel takes it. 

For comic book movie (as u said Deadpool for 12 yo's) go Shazam. I laughed so hard. 

One's a movie in a universe, the other is a fun time."
"15712","@linoleumcast @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @AmazingGraceMov @HighLifeMovie @KinoLorber From just looking at the poster the Aretha movie looks life changing. With that said here are my favourite concert movies in no order. Dont judge:

"15731","@Cassikat06 We all have a superhero inside us, it just takes a bit of magic to bring it out. In Billy Batson's case, by shouting out one word - SHAZAM! - this streetwise fourteen-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult superhero Shazam."
"15732","Here's a tip while enjoying Shazam. In one hand buttered and salted theatre popcorn, the other a handful of Reece's pieces.  Eat them at the same time; you'll thank me later. #Shazam #ShazamMovie"

"15739","@TheRadicalJawa I started reading the New 52 Shazam and that’s where I recognize her from."
"15740","I enjoyed Shazam (it’s really fun!), but there is some disturbing imagery in there that feels like a big tonal shift from the rest of the movie. 

Like... if you’ve got kids, I would really take that PG-13 seriously."
"15741","@ElonPaige Ummm idk. Wonder Woman is tough film to top for me, but Shazam was great"
"15742","@LDR_Violence @Variety I was talking in general, not just comic book movies. @ShazamMovie is the first DCEU film to be lighthearted. Avengers Infinity War wasn't exactly lighthearted either..."

"15744","Was pleasantly surprised by how good @ShazamMovie was!"
"15745","Shazam! But with a guy who gains super rap powers that give him:
Eminem’s technical ability
Tupac’s heart
Biggie’s imagery
Nas’s storytelling
Jay’s knowledge
Andre’s creativity

"15753","Congrats to @ZacharyLevi for breathing new life into the DCEU with Shazam! A solid, artful origin story with such a positive ending. And yeah, I’m gonna say it: I want to see him fight Henry Cavill as Superman. #justiceleague2"
"15754","The #Shazam end credits were an absolute delight to watch and go in the same category as Ant-Man and the Wasp's end credits. It's a treat to see filmmakers really put some thought and creativity into saying goodbye to the audience and letting them go feeling good."
"15755","@ZacharyLevi @UberKryptonian I have a puppy (16 weeks old) who will eventually be my assistance/therapy dog. She's already made a massive impact on my life, so I hope strongly for the future. Hopefully, she'll be with me when we see Shazam 2 and the Black Adam movie. Thank you for your time, take care"
"15756","@ZacharyLevi @UberKryptonian Shazam has found a special place in my heart, and shows your emotional truth throughout, and exactly what you're saying in the video is shown in the film through Billy's arc with his foster family. I'm just so grateful for the film, for hearing your issues &amp; letting me air mine."
"15757","thread of shazam! characters as john mulaney quotes bc i'm bored and i loved this film"
"15758","guess im pulling an all nighter to go to the theater and watch shazam"
"15759","@stringofcharact too many fans dont understand this less MCU-esque forced comedy (Shazam does it right) more good storytelling with varying tone not tough to figure out dont just make the same movie over and over again to please people @DCComics"
"15760","My guess is Shazam 2 will begin filming almost the same time as Black Adam and both release in the same year."
"15761","@ShazamMovie is now my favorite movie. I only wish they would have put @SHAQ as the magic sorcerer."
"15762","@DevinKeller25 Wasn’t this guy in that Horror Film, Shazam?"
"15763","why go to the movies when i can just watch a low quality cam recording of shazam?? this way i can still be a public nuisance to yall."
"15764","JS ZJJSKSKSK OK SAME (not that id do this in public but after seeing the movie i just cant stop myself from screaming shazam!... Like from time to time it's getting worse"
"15765","Honestly, I'd love that, because then DC would have the best female superhero movie and best black (live action) superhero movie, and really stick it to Marvel.

It'll be their big underdog redemption arc after shitting the bed with BvS."
"15766","anyway so i went to see shazam and i am a zachary levi stan account now"
"15767","shazam 2019 a very fruitful and appetizing movie"
"15768","@ZacharyLevi Thank you for this. Media is a huge way to spread happiness (or any kind of emotion), and #SHAZAM did that for me. The last time I felt that good after seeing a movie was perhaps when I saw Pursuit Of Happyness<U+263A><U+FE0F>"
"15769","@ItsDavery I really enjoyed Venom.   It’s more a popcorn movie; but it’s so much fun.   I enjoy the MCU; but I found Venom not following that formula refreshing.   A lot of people put it on par with Shazam and maybe Aquaman."
"15770","Honestly the best possible way to describe this magnificent film."
"15771","Y’know, no spoilers here, but after seeing Shazam, I get how a Black Adam movie could work. If they treat it less like it’s own franchise and more like a prequel or a spin-off, that could be a super interesting movie that would keep the momentum focused on their inevitable fight."
"15772","Shazam was good. It's like the best DC movie since Christopher Nolan came and went with his Batman stuff"
"15773","I’ve been busy with rehearsals and shows for Mamma Mia! Shouldve spent my first night off in 2 months resting but I spent it watching @ShazamMovie . No regrets. Instantly became one of my favorite films of all time. What do I need to do to be friends with @ZacharyLevi ?"
"15774","They play slow hands in Shazam"
"15775","@AqeelDC @PotterThawne I loved them all. Shazam was definitely the most fun out of them, Aquaman was badass, MoS and WW were phenomenal origin stories."
"15776","@Variety Hei @ponysmasher can you explain why Billy and Shazam look have different personality ??"
"15777","#Shazam really didn’t do it for me or my group. Which I say with genuine pain as I was looking forward to it. I’m glad others are enjoying it. I’ll just have to wait for #TheJoker. Which I’m happy to bet money on loving."
"15778","The more I see and hear from @ZacharyLevi, the more I love that dude. So freaking glad he’s now my fav superhero #Shazam. The guy is genuinely super awesome and super nice. Ideal #CaptainMarvel for us!"

"15780","@ZacharyLevi You probably wont even see this, but I have to say this, you have become one of my favourite people ij these few weeks. I started watching chuck and now I cant stop, I am already planning on seeing shazam more than 3 times. You have this certain charisma to you which is so unique"
"15781","Seeing a lot of ""this is the *real* Captain Marvel"" comments out there. FFS, guys, let it go. You've got an excellent movie in cinemas right now. It's literally one of the best superhero films of recent times. Stop trying to cause shit over a name &amp; just celebrate #Shazam."
"15782","@markall43 @Variety @ShazamMovie Shazam was ALWAYS going to be lighthearted, Aquaman was lighthearted, Justice League was butchered and forced into being lighthearted because of the pressure from the majority's boxed ""give. me. FUN!"" mentality. IW had cringeworthy jokes THROUGHOUT the film until the end."
"15783","@markall43 @Variety @ShazamMovie Endgame is supposed to be apocalyptic &amp; still has Ant-Man making jokes towards the end of the trailer. If you've had a franchise that consistently prioritizes ""fun"" for the general audience, allow a different franchise to prioritise emotions &amp; take itself seriously. Balanced."
"15784","@ZacharyLevi 2nd time was this weekend, took my nephew. He loved it! We got a poster and a cup! I think I’m going to go see it again but this time on ScreenX in LA!

DEFINITELY the better Captain Marvel movie. Easily."
"15789","Got to have a movie night with the bestie"
"15790","@bulkslabhead @Moon_Clinic Shazam was surprisingly good.  All the characters were likable and fun.  The villain arch was subpar but it’s still better than most superhero movies.  I was actually surprised in the third act.  Looking forward to more."
"15791","Ahhhh I need to watch this asap"
"15792","Sonic flossing in the movie: everyone are losing their shit.

"15806","wait so is Shazam actually pretty alright?
and Captain Marvel was shit...

are we in the Berenstain timeline now or what, because that'd be a good DC movie and a bad Marvel one"

"15808","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie I totally agree with WW. @ShazamMovie is such a fun movie to watch. I had a blast watching it!"
"15809","So many Christian would go out and prefer to watch movies like Shazam or Dumbo etc while ignoring movies like @UnplannedMovie the story of @AbbyJohnson .people of God in a country were over supposedly half believe In Christ should work to expose the evil and truth about abortion"

"15831","Saw Shazam! today. Not my favorite, but it was good. Really well made. Further proof that Zack Snyder isn't the person to put in charge of the DC films. Both Aquaman and Shazam! are good, successful movies without his involvement."
"15832","NO SPOILER REVIEW OF SHAZAM <U+2B07><U+FE0F>

this was such an amazing movie okrr. the trailers really only show the humor but this movie has so much heart as well. zachary’s performance was stellar along with jack dylan grazer. i get why people mention the humor sm because it is a big part ++"

"15839","Shazam! was pretty good but not perfect. When it is trying to be funny it is hilarious, and the foster home characters and story are fantastic and full of heart, but the Superhero part of the movie is underwhelming and basic forgettable punching people in the face stuff. #Shazam"

"15903","Solid film, a great fusion of BIG/Superhero films but as a Superhero film its mediocre. I can’t see Shazam working in the wider DCEU ecosystem, he subverts too many tropes in this genre which is great for the character but not the genre. Shazam to me will be it’s own thing."

"15910","Still really want to watch Shazam again while it's still in cinema. It's one of the most fun films I've seen at the cinema. And The Portrait of a Lady is absolutely brilliant - I need to watch more of Jane Campion's work. Widows is sensational too, and Ant-Man was a blast."

"15913","This was literally the only gripe I had with the movie. It’s been bugging me ever since I saw it 2 weeks ago because I thought it was WB basically confirming the end of Henry’s Superman. Thank you to @ponysmasher for proving that was not the case. Damn those scheduling conflicts!"

"15921","you don’t have to pit one movie against another"
"15922","#Shazam. Was. Awesome!

Congrats, @DCComics! #DCEU is finally on the right track, it seems!

#ShazamMovie"
"15923","@ChrisHewitt Will Shazam be DC’s Deadpool (sans the profanity, obviously)? Feels like the character(s) fits that mould, and it’s unlikely that DC will be able to resist serializing their heroes despite the first attempts not going their way. #empirepodcast"
"15924","I wasn't sure if I would see Shazam, the first trailer looked a little too campy to me. The 2nd trailer convinced me to go and watch it. I enjoyed the movie, it exceeded expectations. I give it an 8/10."
"15925","@SeanCollins66 It’s tough to compare Shazam to The Godfather"
"15926","i’m so fucking proud of @ZacharyLevi and cast and crew!!!!! ughhhh ily Zach!"
"15927","#Shazam I just want be the lucky Guy"
"15928","@GraceRandolph Hey grace, I like your videos. But I think Shazam was a success because @TheRock  just posted a video of how he is going to start filming #BlackAdam next year and how it was because of him to not use black Adam just yet. You should do a video on that please."
"15929","@MrsBlodwen @RichardDawkins Shazam only identifies original sound tracks comparing them with those on the internet. <U+0001F60E><U+0001F60E>"

"15931","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover The music choices were on point too! Loved it! <U+0001F495>"

"15934","Really enjoyed watching #Shazam last night. I sit in the middle when it comes to DC films as some have been good and some not so much, but this was really good!"
"15935","Funny but childish . Similar like Deadpool only not much cursing and swearing  . Overall , simple story line . Next. #ShazamMovie"
"15936","Just asked Ollie which film he preferred, having seen both: Captain Marvel or Shazam! Ollie: ""Ooh, that's a hard one. Erm, Shazam I think, because it had more death!"" Oh dear."
"15937","Shazam is a good film. It’s a very good film but it’s not a 5/5 it even a 4/5 because it doesn’t do anything to the genre. DC just made a decent film and that’s that."
"15938","Went to see Shazam...pretty Good...emphasis on MGood...."
"15939","Here comes a @MurrellDan level rant. Went to see Shazam. A huge group sits behind us and proceeds to talk loudly, kick our chairs and use their phones. We ended up moving, because we could. I'll never understand why anyone pays to see a movie and then ruins it for everyone else."
"15940","Best DCEU since Wonder Woman. In fact those are the only two good live action DCEU since Dark Knight Rises."
"15941","Damn Wild rose showing is just limited just outside London as I’m based in London. I didn’t know."
"15942","I don't see the issue with the Superman cameo in #Shazam I'd like to look at it from a point of view of yes, Superman still exists in the universe we're building. Plus, it would kind of take the moment away from the character the film is about."
"15943","You haven't actually seen the movie but the excess breast milk you've taken won't let you respect yourself. I will just dash you block to build mansion<U+0001F612>"

Oh screw it, I'm watching #Shazam later <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F601>"

I mean, look at Aquaman and Shazam! <U+0001F62E>"
"15946","Watched #shazam today....
It was pure fun...enjoyed a lot...@ZacharyLevi you rocked the show....
The way he hides behind a 15 year old freddie despite being a superhero <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923>.Don't miss the ending. 
Lets go... #captainsparklefingers"
"15947","If you a true dc/marvel fan you'll know the irony of the captain marvel vs shazam in the box office <U+0001F602>"
"15948","I literally could not have less interest in seeing that stupid Shazam movie. It’s looks so stupid and so many people are saying it’s one of the best DC movies to date and honestly that says a lot about the quality of the movies they make"
"15949","Geoff Johns was the executive producer of Shazam, OF COURSE the movie was so spot-on to the comics. I LOVE being a comic fan in this day and age."
"15950","@colldreamprodco Crayons are fun. Especially those fun scent ones. Films that play on all those sense are wonderful. Visually, Shazam seems to look quite nice."
"15951","@colldreamprodco Hahaha really? So it's rich in the culture of Philly? So after reading your responses on Shazam, does it feel like a Marvel film, early DC film, or something completely new?"
"15952","DC's version of Power Ranger

#Shazam!"
"15953","SHAZAM! Had a smaller budget than Ghostbusters 2016.
So yes it counts as a success."
"15954","Even though it suffers from origin story challenges, #Shazam is such a funny and cool watch. DC definitely have their answer to @deadpoolmovie and best of all, its PG13, atleast in India. And I absolutely loved Mr Mind!"
"15955","What I liked a lot about #Shazam was that the baddies and the wizard, not Mark Strong, gave me a #MortalKombat feel and then @ponysmasher gave us a scene of Raiden beating up Johnny Cage in a video game. I was sold on the movie in that moment for sure."
"15956","Shazam is what I've been wanting the DC movies to be my entire life."
"15957","Shazam was pretty dope it seems like DC finally starting to figure it all out"
"15958","@TheRock Well-done on Shazam, please do The Atom, it's much more interesting."
"15959","Y'all really have to go watch this 
It's so so so good <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"15960","Watching shazam made me realize the difference between marvel and DC 
DC has quite a  long way to go but nevertheless 

SHAZAM WAS FUCKING AMAZING 

Huge surprises and it is simply hilarious 

A headsup tho: the costumes were bleh but well"
"15961","weird thought but isn't Shazam! the DC version of hannah montana?"
"15962","I really loved this movie!!! I laughed so much, the message was great, some super cheesy moments but I think that was the point. I have hope for DC <U+0001F923>"
"15963","@swampskulls As far as DC movies go, I saw Shazam! today and highly recommend it to take the bad taste out of your mouth. It's so fun and funny and cool. Zachary Levi is lovely and it is a really sweet movie."
"15964","@GROOTin @ShazamMovie @TheDCUniverse Well to an extent you're right but then again DC had made movies which are grim to the core. Yes they tried it with Justice League and then Aqua Man was better. Shazam simply takes the cake when it comes to watchable value."
"15965","#Shazam is how DC should be making movies now on-wards. It had comedy, drama, family love, action &amp; to top it all of, it had a kid superhero who behaved like how a kid should do. The villain was a little weak but it's not the last we've seen from him. @ShazamMovie @TheDCUniverse"
"15966","@SJWSuperman I'm kind of sad that's all Shazam made opening weekend.  It's so great I'd have loved it to make more of a splash!

Still, there's plenty of time and it's so great I'm confident it will have no problems getting an audience."
"15967","@SJWSuperman If making around half its budget in a weekend is failing...I have a feeling Shazam is going to be just fine.

Sure, I'd have loved its opening weekend to be better, but with Easter weekend coming up I'm sure more will be heading to the cinema this week."
"15968","Buzzing to see shazam later"
"15969","#Shazam is really something else

"15970","@ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi @wbpictures @DCComics @ShazamMovie  fun filled movie, but as a DC fan i expected more action scenes and some destruction scenes @ZackSnyder @PattyJenks @creepypuppet but it's okay i liked it anyway, may be u should consider this in sequel <U+2764><U+FE0F>from India<U+0001F1EE><U+0001F1F3>"
"15971","DC's #Shazam in theaters April 5, 2019"
"15972","The diverse family in #Shazam have me so many emotions"
"15973","Top 3 customers from yesterday:

1) Whoever left a tiny rubber fetus in a seat cup holder after watching shazam
2) Old woman who instructed me to “think with my brain” after asking what was wrong with her seat
3) “Um, excuse me, but those [pet semetary] posters have a typo..”"
"15974","grabe was so excited to get a notif from yt that there's a trailer for aquaman 2. when the video started, it was a trailer for SHAZAM and it was posted on april fool's day. congratulations youtube you got the joke a week late"
"15975","Mr. Mind in Shazam just reminds me of how Doom Patrol randomly has Admiral Whiskers the rat and that one talking cockroach"
"15976","The movie Shazam was surprisingly pretty good."
"15977","@lipstickpatrol @BollyBrit We were just debating which one to watch today. Marvel or Shazam!"
"15978","anyone who already watched shazam? is it good and recommended and worth watching in the cinemas? should i watch it?"
"15979","shazam but for photos of book pages people smarter than me post on instagram stories"
"15980","@adilmmir @ShazamMovie @TheDCUniverse i disagree,others are dark charactors...movie should do justice to its charactor no matter how then tone is dark or light"
"15981","I loved Shazam<U+26A1>! I've been following @ZacharyLevi work since Chuck and I'm a Brazilian fan! The character is sensational <U+0001F495> Congratulations<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+26A1>"
"15982","Shazam is a very fun and enjoyable movie. That is all."
"15983","From the trailer sef, I could see the rubbish"
"15984","@ponysmasher Loved Shazam, so much set up for part 2 and 3 and for Billy to join the JL! What a great time that would be watching him interact with the League! Please make it happen DC!"

New marvel discovery 
@ShazamMovie suits @Iyervval perfectly"
"15986","This was definitely the most fun DC movie I’ve seen so far. And while DC movies have been fun before, this has something the dc movies recently didn’t really have...as cheesy as it is...it’s got a lot of heart man and I love it! #Shazam"
"15987","@RohanNaahar @htTweets @htshowbiz @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @ponysmasher A marvel-ous family entertainer. As a fan I was really taken off guard by the surprise in the carnival scene. Not all heroes need to be dark and grim."
"15988","@MovieMarker @WarnerBrosEnt Wow love to see this movie  #SHAZAM<U+2060>"
"15989","Puts Aquaman to shame. Third best in the DCEU"
"15990","why doesnt my nearby xxi have shazam in regular theatre but only in premiere"
"15991","@ssabrinay Oh dang that's really creepy. What cinema you pergi! The other day I caught Us and Shazam at MBO tiada pula!"
"15992","Even better than The Dark Knight? Im a bit sceptical - considering the late Heath Ledger's performance"
"15993","easily"
"15994","I don't know if SHAZAM is a good movie, but it is definitively not a miserable, soul rending experience, which makes it pretty easily the best thing DC's done. Aquaman was also OK"
"15995","Just in case it wasn’t obvious, #shazam is awesome and you should go and see it now! <U+0001F929>"
"15996","honestly, seeing Shazam just made me even more terrified to find my blood parents oops"
"15997","@6Hairy6Sub6 @ShazamMovie Surprisingly good! Go check it out if you haven’t already and stay for after credits."
"15998","shazam was a hit and probably the best dceu movie i’ve see yet."
"15999","@aishatyler @ShazamMovie @RottenTomatoes @ZacharyLevi @adamrodriguez Can't wait to see it. #SHAZAMMovie"
"16000","Just went to watch Shazam, it wasn't as funny as though it was, but the emotional moments really hit everything it was supposed to. And even deeper, perhaps."
"16001","@Miss_magnolia20 The movie isn’t close to what the comics are , you should read the comics and The new 52 then you’d see that Shazam in comics is badass and not a piece of joke"
"16002","Today, while viewing Shazam, I ate a large popcorn and didn’t drop a single kernel on my shirt or the floor! 2019 really is my year!  <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FF><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FF><U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FF>#MondayMotivation"
"16003","Little kid sitting next to me at Shazam! yesterday was terrified by some scenes, especially the one in the boardroom. But he loved it. I thought David Sandberg judged the monster stuff in a family film just right"
"16004","@TheHomieMoya Out of the seven DC movies (from man of steel to Shazam) Aquaman is easily better than Justice League, Suicide Squad and BatmanvSuperman. On its own, it’s an okay film."
"16005","(just go to the session you prefer....)"
"16006","@ponysmasher did I notice some Annabelle creation camera angles??? Who cares if I did or didn’t. Love everything you’ve done so far, and LOVED Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"16007","Damn didn’t even know Shazam came out, I hope that ting good"
"16008","@Sylien_ I’m really looking forward to it, one of my favourite games, and fantasy universe! Unfortunately I’ll be late to the stream tonight as I’m going to see Shazam"
"16009","@Ser_Jon_Arryn WW should not be #5. Shazam is not as good to be close to #3 spot."
"16010","@SupesBatsy Then you have the days after the weekend, because Shazam became good for some critics and some audience, there's the notion that: A. Their reccomendations are gonna bring more people and more money in. and B. Those that have seen it would want to watch it again."
"16011","@SupesBatsy Whereas Shazam due to it being the first live action adaptation in decades on top of being part of the canon of a franchise that has gained both praise and controversy, their marketing was limited."
"16012","8/10. Almost perfectly does what the basis of all superhero stories should do. Has heart and balances it's tone brilliantly. Also enough for the fans of the comics to get some nods whilst being subtle enough not to big down the movie audience"
"16013","ayy they used my gif"
"16014","@DCComics @ShazamMovie mi know endgame might be the best...but i am a huge DC fan and would b greatly disapointed if this movie does not hit top 10....keep it up!"
"16015","@ponysmasher your vision of what #Shazam could be exceeded anything this #DcFanboy could've imagined you brought both depth and levity to the characters.  Amazing work @ZacharyLevi as well"
"16016","Headless Superman is not a fucking spoiler ..

Showing Headless Superman pic is like saying ""Hey dont eat this food..u will get diarrhoea"" or ""Dont lean on that railing.. its broken and u will die"" or ""Don't put ur finger in that plugpoint""

So stop the fake outrage #Shazam"
"16017","She was producing it as The Rock’s Manager, not as Henry’s... as proven by the end of the movie, because..."
"16018","Shazam! Is a really awesome movie and you should watch it"
"16019","Why is no one talking about the Annabelle (horror nope doll) cameo in Shazam????"
"16020","I think the big reason why Shazam ended up being actually good is that it was surprisingly emotional. I did not expect this kind of depth from this movie. The message was nice and it was just a really fun movie"
"16021","So... Finally Shazam came out and shut every hater up! Lol <U+0001F602>"
"16022","@ShazamMovie was such a good movie omfg <U+0001F60D><U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FC> 10/10 would def recommend watching it !"
"16023","happy monday everyone. just a friendly reminder that you all need to see Shazam! because it’s one of the best DC films and my favorite film so far this year."
"16024","@ZacharyLevi you were perfect as Shazam, hopefully one day I can meet you to tell you personally."
"16025","My local theatre is canceling a showing of Shazam because only two of us showed up to see it. FFS man this place is a joke <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"16026","Just watched #ShazamMovie.... not as good as I’d hoped tbh the animated one is better"
"16027","I haven't watched Shazam but I know it is great so go watch it in theaters"
"16028","#Shazam was pretty good. Go watch it and invite me so I have an excuse to see it again"
"16029","Shazam<U+26A1> was a good B grade that happens to be a film for teenagers. A well-made film is a well-made film &amp; should be able to be enjoyed by any audience - maturity levels notwithstanding. The off-stage gore was good directing in action &amp; the emotional arc respected the audience."
"16030","@lartist Shazam<U+26A1> was a good B grade that happens to be a film for teenagers.

"16033","@danielw65350066 @josephwayne2421 Do you think Shazam had heart?I don't think so.
I don't hate the film but I just got mostly entertainment from it. I don't see pure heart in it"
"16034","@danielw65350066 @josephwayne2421 I would love to see how Billy struggles with his new family and his high school life. But Shazam going on joking and show off(which is definitely needed)kinda feel it was more of an entertainment"
"16035","@SpiderPunk2003 Wait, I just want to know how much Shazam is filled with heart. I don't know about Shazam and I have never read his comics but just give me a scene from the film that it proves it has heart. After I watched, I still don't see it was just filled with heart"
"16036","Totally forgot that Matt Bomer was in Chuck with Zachary Levi. I mean, he was the reason for Chuck being Chuck so."
"16037","I need the gif of Shazam dancing thanks in advance"
"16038","I should be doing my essay but I went to watch #Shazam after uni oops"
"16039","@ZacharyLevi Just watched Shazam yesterday. SO FUNNY! Me and my girlfriend laughed our buts of! Definitely worth the ticket and I’m buying it as soon as it gets released! <U+0001F602><U+0001F44D><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"16040","Why did you say this?
Now I have to block you"
"16041","@TheFliteCast @MrkVersion2 @Steele131 And WW earned 50 mill after homecoming was released wid 360 million already earned by then,  shazam would only have 230, 240 optimistically by the time endgame is released &amp; after endgame it can earn max 30 mill more, that is if endgame is good, max 250  for shazam realistically"
"16042","@_MLopesdaSilva Personally I think they represent more than their physical appearance. Each kid, from what I understood, represented a trait in the acronym “SHAZAM” Freddie being stamina of atlas and Pedro being the strength of Hercules. It’s who they are, not what they look like that counts"
"16043","@1moreGaryFrank @Chevindu @ZacharyLevi Your #SHAZAM is by far the best! You should be proud!"
"16044","My favorite thing on the planet rn is the Shazam movie and that’s that on that!!"
"16045","@AmazonChique Ghostbusters Budget: 150 Million
Shazam Budget: 80 Million

HERPADERP

Shazam has done 150 Million worldwide in the 3 day weekend

Ghostbusters did 229 Million Worldwide over 3 months.

Ghosttbusters=Name Brand
Shazam=Not name brand

So maybe you should think about that"
"16046","So #Shazam. Well-casted. Acting and writing rough in some parts. They ought to have given Levi and Asher some traits to share because they acted and sounded like 2 different people. Cinematography generic. Sfx, vfx average."
"16047","So #Shazam is more inspiring and relatable, storywise and characterwise in one movie, than Superman has been so far through three movies in the #DCEU. But y'all still think @ZackSnyder is Jesus :D :D ok o."
"16048","Both Shazam &amp; Wonder Woman are really DC at their best and I really hope they can bring that greatness (and maybe even more greatness) to a Superman film one day"
"16049","@josephwayne2421 I loved Shazam but Homecoming was quite flat to me in all honesty and I never even cared about Shazam til this film came out"
"16050","@namobanya I agree, I think they achieved what they were trying to do, which was to introduce to the MCU and they did it well. You should see Shazam"
"16051","Hi, I would like to say that Shazam was really entertaining. Easily one of the best DCEU movies. 
Really good/10"
"16052","Mind blown superhero movie @TGVCinemas &amp; best part is when the power of #shazam being shared as to 6 super-humans <U+0001F4AA> #FilmTwitter #ShazamMovie #ShazamFilme #superheroes #godsquad #Solomon #Hercules #Atlas #Zeus #Achilles #Mercury"

5. Captain Marvel (2019)

"16061","@TheNiceCast_ Shazam ! 2 should be The SHAZAM family movie. 
That was the point of the first movie after all, family....."
"16062","This the same feeling I had about the movie.."
"16063","@TIME Shazam is the first DC movie after the ""dark knight triology"" which i found awesome"
"16064","@OndraKolek @totalfilm Well stop complaining about Captain Marvel and go watch Shazam"
"16065","Cultural sensibilities are constantly changing, that's all. Currently, heroism is ""fun, but doing the right thing...but mostly having fun"". And Shazam was loads of FUN, therefore he's more heroic than Superman, despite him being selfless and literally self sacrificing ¯\_(<U+30C4>)_/¯"
"16066","Shazam was actually super good! Very impressed they never mentioned Captain Marvel"
"16067","Can’t wait to see Shazam I just couldn’t convince the parents to see it with me and they were up this weekend"
"16068","@DCComics @ShazamMovie The @ODEONCinemas is really expensive &amp; @DCComics movies have been so bad, so a new kind of movie is good but I can't afford to go to the Odeon &amp; chance it.

"16078","So I saw Shazam! and the movie was more clever (and dark) than I anticipated from advertising. 
My husband particularly liked Cooper Andrew's 'dad' character as an emotionally mature and nurturing figure. Worth a watch!"

I think that thing in the third act, that I liked so much, is also the thing in the third act that @HelenLOHara liked but I can't be sure.

"16090","@caitlynatbest lol, it's pretty stupid they think Marvel stole the name when it has been a while since Marvel legally owns the brand. Besides, Shazam is Shazam. Captain Marvel is Captain Marvel. They were both marketed differently."

"16117","@alan_cerda2002 That’s him out of his Shazam form."
"16118","If you look like your Shazam form, why leave it?! This one thing would’ve saved him from being murdered by Superman."

"16120","@olliegerlach @EnglishmanSDCC I mean, if it’s the same thing that makes me think that in Geoff Johns Shazam comic there’s also a queer hero in the making, then yeah, it’s small but I need it lol."
"16121","So turns out my Shazam screening is SuperScreen, which is my first time doing SuperScreen I believe. But it wasn’t much more expensive in the day so why not."

"16123","I went to SHAZAM! on the weekend with the 13yo. He gave it a solid 7/10. It’s no CAPTAIN MARVEL but like the last couple DC hits, enjoyable fluff. (Apart from the early car crash #triggerwarning and scary demons in the first act.)"
"16124","@MacShady1 Hi Maxine, yes it’s hard deciding what to do. We are going to the cinema to see Missing Link and older grandson is going to see Shazam with his grandad. What ever you decide to do enjoy, it’s lovely to see you on here xx"

"16137","@JacobBrinkworth Yeah, I don't get why people are bagging on Shazam! for the cinematography. Even colour wise, the film smartly uses the snowing landscape of Philadelphia to make the vibrant costume design pop in contrast to its environment."
"16138","everyone make sure to support shazam out now in your local theatres"
"16139","@ArvindKejriwal Arrey aap wo sab Chhodiye sir, please review Shazam first. I don't watch movies without your reviews."

"16149","part of me kind of wish Shazam had open somewhere at the end of July or beginning of August. putting it in the middle of Captain Marvel and Endgame is a bold move!"
"16150","Oof shazam tomorrow we've really reached the day"
"16151","At the cinema waiting to watch #Shazam! Not sure if watching this in 4dx is a good thing tho!"

"16162","Facts"
"16163","@ZacharyLevi Whatta movie maaan ! Nailed your acting ... been your fan since Chuck and I used to watch the series over and over again . I thoroughly enjoyed watching you as SHAZAM!"
"16164","Hey @ODEONHelp, two questions. 

1.) Why can't I rate #dumbo in the odeon app? I went to see #Shazam since and I was able to rate that fine.

2.) Why is veg chill advertised but NEVER available?"
"16165","Good idea to make it separated and with this WB can make Black Adam origin story to the fullest"
"16166","Is it better to go see Pet Sematary or Shazam because I heard it was an actual decent movie

"16170","shazam was pretty good. 6.5/10 - flaws, but a lot of fun. I could watch a Zachary Levi montage to ‘Dont Stop me Now’ for two hours."
"16171","If anyone is 50/50 on shazam!, go and see it, great movie. 8/10."
"16172","@grayghost84 Both movies are very good at what they wanted to be. BvS is a study of society, a thriller that uses superheroes as a set up. Shazam! is a comedy inspired in ""Big"" or ""The Goonies"". BvS will always be a masterpiece, Shazam! will be a classic. Every movie is their own thing!"
"16173","I still haven't seen it yall I wanna die I was super excited for the movie and I still haven't had the chance to see it"
"16174","@rozietoez Didn't stop Captain Marvel, Oceans 8 or Black Panther did it?

It also didn't help that it had the worst to debut trailer of all time.

You ever think that maybe just maybe Ghostbusters 2016 was not a good movie?

#Ghostbusters #shazam"
"16175","Easy Answer: they tried to replicate every DC character into the style of Nolan.

Which only truly works for Batman maybe Suicide Squad.

And before anyone says Green Lantern, that movie was never going to succeed because of all the behind-the-scenes drama.

"16208","I'm going to be thinking of Shazam for the next four weeks maybe!! It's so goofy but also emotionally touching enough to not be too Blandy McBlanderson like a Kraft Cheese. Everybody's personalities were distinct &amp; the villain was actually compelling &amp; vital to the story wow"

"16242","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie I loved the movie"
"16243","Nigerians are the only ones complaining about this movie which is how I know the movies is good."
"16244","Shazam except cliff from Doom Patrol is the foster dad and he can raise children nice ans happily"
"16245","Despite the succes of #Shazam, DCEU has lots to catch up with MCU. MCU is about to end a crazy exiting 10 years saga and is about to start a new saga while DCEU may i say, just learnt to walk."
"16246","@ZacharyLevi Maybe with #ShazamMovie success you can get the #chuckmovie funded. Just a thought. <U+0001F609>"
"16247","This weekend took my son to see #Shazam in our first ever experience of a D-Box 3-D setting.  It was amazing in this format.  So awesome!  Of course, my boy loved the movie as much as I did.  Now he's a bit obsessed with Mister Mind."
"16248","Going to watch Shazam thought I’d beat the system getting snack from the shop 1st. my son is moving like Wer about to do a diamond heist moving all shook Kmt he needs to man up lol"

"16250","#Shazam - Good one:) Interesting &amp; engaging seat edge entertainer:) Nice hilarious performances &amp; super making:) A new superhero series started:) Congrats &amp; all d best team:)"
"16251","@chibicelina @BobbyDank @justsomeguycc Yeah but if you sat through bvs or jl your probably very iffy on the quality of dcu movies in general.

Certainly after bvs I have avoided all dcu movies, shazam the first that's held any appeal."
"16252","Pag DC talaga daming mother issues ano, Batman, The Flash, Aquaman and now Shazam <U+0001F602>"

"16256","I grew up knowing that Shazam was actually called captain marvel and now that the Marvel captain marvel is a thing and out at the same time I'm just confused!

Both are fantastic movies I just keep calling them the DC/Marvel captain marvel <U+0001F602><U+0001F605>"
"16257","@KwingReviews Marvel is superior in films... end if story... we know u love dc but dont be blind... i really enjoyed Shazam and might watch it again but its not going to save the DC universe... i am wondering whats next for DC but what ever it is cant top Marvels films. 
My opinion*"
"16258","@KwingReviews And just for the record i think the best superhero film of all time is the Dark Knight. But everything after that, that DC came out with was either bad or just an ok film. Expect for shazam  again i dont think this film will save on what DC themselves destroyed.
My opinion*"
"16259","Not a big fan of DC movies because there’s not much comedy in it but Shazam was definitely 10/10 and hella funny!! <U+0001F60A>"
"16260","Entertaining 
Dc comic movie with marvel touch — watching Shazam! Movie"
"16261","Hello Shazam is the best dceu movie so far ok after that horrendous piece called justice league this is such a nice refresh"
"16262","US (2019) plummeted to #4 behind the Dumbo (2019) flop. Only 7.4 IMDB rating. Now they say Shazam! (2019) is awesome. I've seen the weak trailer. They're really hyping these movies!"
"16263","I hope this trend to pad out the costume goes the way of 3D soon"
"16264","Aquaman and Wonderwoman still best DC movies so far and Shazam is definitely better than Batman Vs Superman and Justice League"
"16265","Seriously want to go see @ShazamMovie again. My daughter said she wanted to go see it.... perfect excuse to go see it again! I’m gonna make it happen! @ZacharyLevi"
"16266","@ponysmasher Shazam was realy good, just one disappointement, why adding the red at the wait of Superman suit? It’s not canon with Snyder Superman.."
"16267","@ComicBooksTalk I dont know why is this tweet so soothing when i think of him kicking the shit outta shazam family along with few members of JL..."
"16268","@CBR No @ShazamMovie. You don't get to be like @jk_rowling and have a gay character after the fact in subtext. Be obvious and make it understood that they're LGBT+ or not at all. No credit for anything else."
"16269","@LeeOnPages Maybe I’m just ready for fun DC movies, but I was extremely charmed by SHAZAM! I didn’t mind the changes in tone so much. It reminded me of an 80’s Amblin movie."

"16272","Great movie"
"16273","@realesttheorist I mean yes prioritize endgame $$wise haha but if you get a chance to watch Shazam it was truly great like 90s vibes goodies stranger things vibes low key monster horror vibes plus beautiful foster family storyline vibes idk I loved it haha"
"16274","Shazam. So they made a superhero movie about a music app? Guess it works."
"16275","Cerita shazam best, fresh comedy and better than captain marvel. 9/10"
"16276","I get the frustration and can totally see where she’s coming from on a larger scale but this is a pretty rubbish &amp; laboured comparison."
"16277","I'm still upset that no one in the Shazam! film suggested that the hero be named ""Red Lightning""."
"16278","@JacobMcMillan3 @AmazonChique Also while Shazam isn't doing records overseas, it is going to end up WAY higher than Ghostbusters. Shazam should reach at least 400M WW on a budget that is at least 60M less. Obviously one is more of a success than the other"

My hubs physical pain does not allow him to get out much but he did and we had a date night! Thank you"
"16285","Shazam is the better movie in my honest opinion. I would really give it like an 8.5 outta 10."
"16286","I love the weird magic side of Shazam just like I love it with Dr. Strange. Strange washes Shazam though tbh."
"16287","Now that most all of the people I know have seen Shazam!...

Just want to say I can't wait to see Mark in more DC press tours."

"16294","// Dude, I just want to say my movie experience was one of the worst I've had in my life and it has nothing got to do with Shazam at all. Seriously, if you don't know how to behave in a cinema, please don't even step inside one."

"16305","There's so much flavour in SHAZAM. A 5 second cameo doesn't kill a film. 

It had a consistently fantastic script.

Consistent great acting. 

The story is fantastic.

It's definitely faithful as fuck and adapted SHAZAM perfectly. 

Only problem I had was some VFX. 10/10."

"16409","Today's fact checking included Shazam! and his original name of Captain Marvel, why it was changed, and apparently all the negative reviews and responses to the movie (he did not include any sources). Presented by: the E4 mafia and E5 gang."
"16410","so i saw shazam but didn't finish it bc i had class and couldn't skip it which sucked"
"16411","Morning News: When I yell out ""Shazam!"" I turn into Captain Marvel (no, not the Marvel one, the DC one)."
"16412","shazam made me cry more than once"
"16413","you guys shazam is a really good movie i was surprised with dc’s production"
"16414","Just let people enjoy dc and marvel without pitting their movies against eachother smh"
"16415","Really hope that good word of mouth has #Shazam doing good for its 2nd weekend. Movie is great. I can’t express that enough."
"16416","@PacficRim23 @ShazamMovie @ponysmasher Clearly you know nothing about the comics, or you're just a blind hater. Shazam! Family was the BIGGEST WTF moment for me. No one was expecting it and that's what they did. No need to hate it for the humor, it was supposed to be like that, but far better from Marvel cheese."
"16417","YMS said this about shazam but it really did remind me of the raimi spiderman flicks with how much heart and honesty the movie was made with."
"16418","Like, in a climate where most marvel movies are basically endlessly filled with quips and jabs at everything with not a lot of sincerity, Shazam actually manages to make humor and feelings out of a relatively basic plot. It's honestly so fucking weird DC  pulled this off well."
"16419","@MetroUK why would you publish an article spoiling the final gag in @ShazamMovie!? <U+0001F914>"
"16420","These are awesome. <U+0001F602>"
"16421","@AmazonChique Maybe because ghostbusters had a budged of 150 million and Shazam’s budget was 80 million."
"16422","@ZacharyLevi Just for a perspective: #Shazam made lesser than #GreenLantern on opening weekend, a film releases 8 years ago to horrendous reviews.

"16425","Im so excited to watch Shazam fkabzjxnsjsnxnz"
"16426","This is known already but I watched Shazam and theres a snippet of legend in it!"
"16427","@jackecheal And it's nice having a different tone or feel to different films. The tone of Shazam might not work for Wonder Woman, while the tone of a Batman film might not work for Shazam. It's about choosing what works for each character and making each film good and work on their own."
"16428","@Ser_Jon_Arryn And I didn’t hate Shazam! at all. That’s not why it’s at the bottom. I love 6 out of 7 of these films . One can burn in Hell."
"16429","Was hoping to double up with #Shazam and #TheSistersBrothers today but the latter is showing at @cineworld telford
Boo!!"
"16430","Thx for the info enjoy shazam aq enjoy my emotion @shipjyanten"
"16431","I went to see Shazam last night and I cried because as funny as it was there was a cute underlying story about family - it was a great movie"
"16432","Just finished watching Shazam! Enjoyed more than Captain Marvel. Both movies are good and worth the watch."
"16433","I love everything about #ShazamMovie 
all the cast is great! @FaitheHerman is the cutest!!
Mark Strong..wow.
Hilarious &amp; dark when it needs to be, feels genuine &amp; warm.
Thank you @ponysmasher 
Bless you @ZacharyLevi"
"16434","@JimmyRGeorge Shazam and pet cemetery"
"16435","@ShazamMovie was so amazing. @ZacharyLevi was perfect. DC please learn from this movie and make your other movies this fun. I almost thought it was a @Marvel movie!"
"16436","we finally going shazam today"
"16437","so um shazam isn't just asher, and shazam isn't just jack, it's jack, asher, and zach so pls stop narrowing it down to one person"
"16438","@ShazamMovie A white mom abandons her son - and a multi-cultural dream foster family helps him while he becomes a superhero.  What are you trying to sell?  This quite literally the worst superhero storyline I’ve ever seen."
"16439","@ShazamMovie And then for some inexplicable reason, the boy has to fight 7 deadly satanic creatures in some sort of quasi-mythological struggle.  This movie is not for kids. @DCComics used deceptive marketing to fool you. @CommonSense"
"16440","@ponysmasher just saw #shazam. Great job. One of the more overlooked aspects that I loved is how the world filled with superheroes reflects cinema rn with lots of superhero films and Freeman reflected superhero fandom. This gave a connection between the audience and the universe."
"16441","God, I’m excited for Black Adam, The Rock is doing a good job with updates. I get it when they didn’t wanna introduce BA to shazam (I was hoping for a cameo in the post scene credits) but this is exciting bc BA is a whole different story<U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F919><U+0001F3FB>"
"16442","My thoughts exactly"
"16443","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Movie was so fun, never heard so much laughs in a movie theatre before. Really enjoyed it!"
"16444","Looking at Shazam, you can tell the budget was not much, yet is one of the best DC Movies I've seen. Maybe because my expectations were so low"
"16445","Shazam was great. Lots of fun and the first dc movie since Wonder Woman I would actually recommend to someone. That said. Go see it."
"16446","The premise behind Shazam! is so charming you want it to be great but... well, it's not. It's good though. The characters are likeable, especially Zachary Levi. The problem is that the movie's inconsistencies kind of start with him and Asher Angel's Billy Batson."
"16447","Shazam! (2019) has something deep to say and special to offer to the increasingly formulaic superhero genre, but it often feels like it can't find its own beat.

7/10"
"16448","Whenever Billy turns into Shazam, he turns into a whole different character. The movie does a good job establishing Billy as a cynical, self-reliant orphan but Shazam is this goofball who doesn't take anything seriously. There's no consistency between them."
"16449","I have to say thanks to @ponysmasher and the rest of the crew for Shazam. It was so tongue &amp; cheek and I loved the entire family in the movie. So believable and loving. Such a warm movie but those jump scares though <U+0001F62D>! @ZacharyLevi @Jgrazerofficial were just...JUST THE BEST!"
"16450","saw #shazam yesterday, was a fun movie, not the best ever made but well worth a watch and a good origin story - don't let the trailers fool you, this isn't a joke filled kids movie (although it does have some jokes in it)"
"16451","@natmetcalfe @markolver You May have just clarified why I love marvel movies but can never really get into the DC ones, with the exception of Shazam (embraces silly) and Wonder Woman (wonder and woman!)"
"16452","@sebslawrence @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @Pathe OMG you met Zach!? the movie so much fun btw <U+0001F62D>"
"16453","I’m so excited @ZacharyLevi is talking about mental health &amp; The importance of treating each other with respect.
@ZacharyLevi - Are you planning to do any longform interviews strictly related to your mental health journey? I believe it could have a huge impact on people. #Shazam"
"16454","I totally agree with this.
#EzraMiller #TheFlash #justiceleague #Shazam"
"16455","Honestly Aquaman should’ve been released in the Summer and Shazam around Christmastime if DC was truly interested in synergy ¯\_(<U+30C4>)_/¯"
"16456","@superrino12 @arka2027 Yes that's what I'm worried about. And now the Williams theme was used in both JL and Shazam. They might make it the default theme from now on"
"16457","Still not on board with the Shazam! Cameo. That's probably the one thing I didn't like about the movie."
"16458","@HeIsKKKay @arka2027 I didn't actually hear the Williams theme in Shazam tho.... I think it wasn't there. But I wouldn't be surprised, if they are going to use it feom now on...."
"16459","Not that anyone cares but here is MY current DCEU films rankings.
1) #WonderWoman
2) #Shazam
3) Everything else is just shit!"
"16460","@ZacharyLevi dude you were amazing in @ShazamMovie I can’t wait to c you in Shazam 2 the whole cast was great"
"16461","Happy Monday!  Top 5 from the weekend and their worldwide totals:

"16464","@Live_for_Films I saw both new openers. Pet sematary had a bland 1st half but the last 30 mins is pretty fantastic. It's very difficult2 watch though. Especially as a parent. And I must be one of the only people in the world who just flat-out did not like Shazam. Silly plot...just not my tempo."

"16474","Spent the whole weekend saying 'Shazam' and nothing came of it."
"16475","@the_moviebob Question.  Now that Aquaman and Shazam have proven to be successful at the box office. I'd love to hear your thoughts on DC's new strategy and how things might play out."
"16476","Anyone that's seen SHAZAM will understand why I liked it so much. It's the campest film I've seen in a good while and I love that shit."
"16477","@ShazamMovie Dabbing is a drug reference though."
"16478","if you want to watch a movie that is organically funny, dark when it needs to be, and just plain fun (more so if you understand the references), go watch captain marvel.

and when i say captain marvel, i only mean SHAZAM!

instant classic. <U+0001F44C>"
"16479","Just got done watching Shazam with my folks.

"16490","Shazam was wonderful. Zachary Levi was charming as always, kid actors were all great. Jokes were funny. I was thoroughly entertained."
"16491","shazam is the best DC movie to date don’t @ me"

The wittiest, craziest, wackiest, fully action comedy movie.

"16495","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie What does fame mean to you?."
"16496","Which DCEU stand-alone/origin story film is the best?

For me, Shazam! and Wonder Woman are both fantastic, Aquaman was a lot of fun and Man of Steel is just okay.

Let me know what you think, cast your vote &amp; have fun!"
"16497","You are what someone out there is looking for, Bono."
"16498","Such a useless excuse they are both origin stories"
"16499","Today my friend came up with probably the best plan ever, we skipped our boring classes to go in the cinema on Shazam just to see him floss and guess what, we regret nothing"

"16504","Let’s be honest, the Rock is damn near identical to Black Adam. Lmfao. Smart they separated them. I wanna see Shazam in the next couple days. Haven’t seen it yet. But it might be a good thing DC is going away from Superman and Batman for a couple years."
"16505","wait I’ve suddenly heard people no like Shazam?? Why he’s all goofy and shit because he’s a kid who’s discovered he’s a fucking superhero now"
"16506","Listen, I like Shazam and all, but there can only be one fast guy.

The Flash."
"16507","@VforVintageVera Mine is Aquaman. WW was great but overall experience-wise, Aquaman wins for me. Will see if that changes soon. Hehe I will see Shazam prolly this weekend."
"16508","@VforVintageVera Ohgod yet another stupid campaign against Shazam this time?! These people geez!"
"16509","@AgnihotriSubrat I have to say this again and again that it is the best film DC has put out. Shazam added the much needed humor that the other DC movies were missing."
"16510","Watch Shazam! for the second time and i didn't found any difference"
"16511","Now that I think about it Shazam would be a super cool way to start of the march towards a JLD movie. And it would be cool if dc focused on magic based movies. Mcu- all about science 
DCEU- all about magic"

@ponysmasher @ZacharyLevi please give us a sequel... for my dad’s sake. We loved it!"
"16521","This Shazam Natsuki idea is already far too exciting."
"16522","No doubt about it, the most telling insult from superhero fans  I’ve gotten since praising  Shazam! Was that I have “the taste of a six year old.” Which, I mean...so do you, guys. That’s the cool part."

"16540","I’m still thinking how incredible #Shazam is. It’s like a parody of superhero movies blended with go-for-broke 80s kids movie homagery. Comes out like a sincere work on its own. I literally cried twice."

"16587","@DFF_Shane @amazehayes_ @DFFMemphis 100% Dr. Sivana is one of Shazam’s greatest. Its not as extensive as Flash‘s. Sivana debuted in the 1940’s I believe and is extremely powerful. Black Adam is soo big and too powerful that you if you did him in the first movie you would have nothing to build up to past that."

"16591","Shazam is the best film of the DCEU."
"16592","Saw #Shazam yesterday. Laughed my ass off. Sometimes at parts that I’m not quiet sure we’re meant to make me laugh. For instance, the villains older brother made fun of him as a child, and his dad laughed! Really manipulative way of trying to make us feel for the antagonist <U+0001F602>"

"16597","Even though it sucks how yt is treating us I will never give up or don't work as hard... Just from the things BTS went through last Year is enough encouragement for me to give it my all for them. I will stream, request, Shazam and everything else. We are doing it for @BTS_twt <U+0001F49C>"
"16598","I can’t believe that I can’t go to the cinema to watch Shazam bc my stomach hurts so bad and I feel dizzy"
"16599","@Shazam please tell me you have plans to make an app for the @SamsungMobile smartwatch! I've got my @SpotifyUSA all I need is you!"
"16600","Funny how DC stunk with Batman and Superman while delivering very watchable fare with Wonderwoman, Aquaman and Shazam. 

It's almost like once the pressure was off and they'd hit rock bottom they got their act together."
"16601","Shazam was so good that if it wasn’t for them mentioning Superman and Batman every 10 minutes I would have thought it was a @Marvel movie"
"16602","taste only in this house <U+0001F60D>"
"16603","@ZacharyLevi Thank you for being so honest. I am a psychiatric nurse practitioner and have been working in mental health a long time. The stigma is real but when people speak as you did, it helps to the end that - especially for the kids. So again - thank you! And Shazam! was great!!"
"16604","I keep getting confused when I hear people giving reviews of Shazam because my mind immediately thinks of the app and at first I wonder why everyone seems so excited about it when it's been around for years but then I remember it's a comic movie too."
"16605","@RafaAntonioDC @the_moviebob It’s a little early to say Shazam is proven to be a success. Those China numbers are terrible. Let’s see how it’s done in two weeks."
"16606","What do you find most interesting about this weekend’s box office results?"
"16607","Finally saw “CAROL, THE MARVELOUS CAPTAIN” over the weekend. Inspirational story of an intergalactic lady and her unusual cat. 4/5 SHAZAM!s"

Hope it grows steadily"
"16623","Shazam! was seriously so good. DC is seriously redeeming itself with every new movie they're putting out.
It was so heartwarming and so much fun to watch, I loved it. <U+0001F60A><U+2764><U+FE0F>

"16624","Shazam! 8.8/10
Action packed Movie, truly the savior of DCEU next to Aquaman. Humor really brought fun to the movie without getting derailed from the story. Worth watching. 
Note: 0.2 point short because you didn’t show who played as Superman. <U+0001F60F>"

Just shows how a director can really harm their own movie by not trusting a composer to just....compose."

"16642","@Fred02961487 @Nashnation72 I almost posted a photo from the strip club in #Shazam, but couldn't find it."
"16643","Saw and dug Shazam. The parallels to Big are strong. Like, Big, the adult version of the kid acts much, MUCH more childlike than the kid version of the kid."
"16644","But DC/ Warner Brothers have been making much better decisions with the last three films - WW, Aquaman, and Shazam. Maybe they have turned the corner... and things are on the upside. As a DC guy, I'm hopeful."
"16645","This is a correct take. Shazam was terrific!

I'm a DC apologist - so I didn't hate BvS and Justice League like Adam, and many others. They aren't perfect movies, by any stretch. But I don't hate the DCEU as much as other people do."

"16659","Much of my optimism, I have to admit, is entirely due to the innate likeability of Levi. You can't not love him, and it's astonishing it's taken this long for Hollywood to kick his door down #Shazam"
"16660","There's not been a lot between Wonder Woman and this, I'm aware. Maybe better to say it could be the only really great one apart from Wonder Woman. #Shazam"
"16661","I've got a good feeling about this. I reckon it could be the first really great DC movie since Wonder Woman

#Shazam"
"16662","@jxsticeleagues The lack of Brie Larson screen time in the movie is what is preventing her from supporting the movie.

Really, it was the fault of the Shazam casting team for not casting her as the lead. They should have known better if they wanted her support."

"16683","@Kim_K9 I really liked them both, but it's ridiculous to say Shazam was just a fun superhero movie when Billy spends most of it dealing with the trauma of being in the foster care system and not knowing where his mother is only to...have that ending."
"16684","SHAZAM SPOILERS
The film was awesome but at the same time cringy. The end is really bad to me because the way other kids get powers sucks and that he “couldn’t defeat the main enemy” solo is stupid.
Also we can forget the floss scene because that was CRINGE"

"16695","#shazam was a terrific movie. Best think to come out of #DC movie wise in 10 years. Had a lot of heart and best of all the trailer didn’t give much away, lots of fun surprises."
"16696","I have seen Shazam and have thoughts. (Spoilers) 1) it’s good fun. 2) the first half hour drags on forever. 3) where’d Sivanna get the red door? 4) Levi’s portrayal reminds me of Jimmy Fallon throughout. 5) I choose to pronounce Shazam like chasm."
"16697","@YeagerKristel @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @The_GWW Edit approved lol, I’d go with a Kryptonian personally, but your acronym your power absorption :)"

"16712","Shazam! was a breath of fresh air for the DC universe, a movie with a dark villain who was legitimately menacing (if not overly deep), but an unrelentingly positive outlook of its main characters and what they represent. It's a Deadpool for people like me who don't like Deadpool."
"16713","Shazam! certainly felt like its own movie with its own personality, though. And it cranked the Philly nostalgia up to 11 for me (with a bonus Minnesota reference!). The performances were authentic, heartfelt, and amazing."
"16714","Comparing Shazam to deadpool and homecoming when they’re nothing alike besides being humorous smh"
"16715","#Shazam is a refreshing take the comic genre the world needed &amp; deserves. It doesn’t follow a cookie cutter plot, or force itself to fit a vibe. So many great actors/scenes PLUS it takes leaps/risks Marvel wouldn’t dream of. On top of that, it’s easily top 5 MOVIES this year."
"16716","F that, it made BP even more watered down than it already was. Shazam does the Diversity factor just as well w/o forcing it down your throat. It gets to be its own movie w/ ppl of all races getting a chance to SHINE, without making it political. Marvel better read more comics <U+0001F634>"
"16717","Loved it! “Aquaman” and “Shazam”are both super self aware, making them way less broody than bvs: the battle of Martha. Loved the direct “Big” reference and thought it was a super fun! Some qualms but it had the same balance of fun and serious as the DC shows of the early 2000s"
"16718","Which one should I watch? #Shazam #Dumbo #Movie"

"16720","@ZBrag101 @heroichollywood U seem obsessed with Captain Marvel and will easily accept false arguments that promote a false narrative about the film in a historical sense.

"16915","so it’s really just the rotten tomatoes score you’re mad about... aw :("
"16916","and the fact that y’all are purposely doing it or laugh when someone asks you not to,,, not mentioning having a whole spoiler layout"
"16917","y’all want me to go watch shazam but spoil the whole movie <U+0001F62D>"
"16918","MCU peter is literally just a whitewashed miles please pipe down"
"16919","@CaptainDiedrich sorry if that wasnt clear. I would take more Wonder Woman and Shazam films over the current crop of the DC film universe. Maybe Aquaman, but thats about it."
"16920","@elitewillie @NewWombat @CheapyD @Shipwreck Hi Will! Thanks for caring and asking if I am hurt. I appreciate you checking on me but I am fine As for other superhero movies off the top of my head I would rank Shazam below Captain Marvel Venom, thor 3 etc, but ahead of Ant man 2 and most other DC movies.  Have a good day!"
"16921","@SeanFennessey is there any spoilers in the new #Shazam Big Picture podcast?"
"16922","The One Winged Angel is about to stomp all over the dreams of another child!

Wait, hold on a sec...how is @CreativeXtreme1 moderating again already???"
"16923","@MegaConOrlando when will you announce the winner for that Shazam contest??"
"16924","DC fans saying #Shazam will do good. I hope it does but I dont think it'll top #Aquaman 1 billion mark or Captain Marvels 1 billion mark. #AvengersEndgame already broke box office ticket presales so it'll be an huge opening weekend. I guarantee Marvel will take the reins again"
"16925","Dwayne looks the part, but I don’t know about his acting chops. I haven’t seen Shazam! yet though. I’d like too, good fan reaction, but that can be deceptive."
"16926","@_kushxcereal Ah...see I can't help that, Shazam/Capt. Marvel one of the 7 so I gotta kinda just sweep the trash under the rug and not mention it lol, we gon get right tho"
"16927","@_kushxcereal Not even. The movies are getting better, it's just that shazam is....shazam the costume looks fucking horrid on that nigga...liken my G didn't get that Wolverine workout had to put him in a muscle suit and it shows"
"16928","@ProfofEvil @HackinTimSeeley yeah we need a superman movie , it sucks that when this universe started it started on the wrong foot , Shazam &amp; Aquaman these types of movies should have been the vision to kick start this universe. If they can't find a director I will say just give it to sandberg"
"16929","@ProfofEvil @HackinTimSeeley As a Superman fan after watching Shazam I truly believe Sandberg can direct a Superman movie that will truly flesh out the character , beside Cavil agent is one of Shazam producers &amp; I think Cavil is great superman but he needs the right material"
"16930","@pedroangelnsc @Partizan_Niksic You're speaking as if the cameo in shazam is one of the worst things to happen the DCEU...when far more stupider things already exists within the universe. (Mustache/Bizarro man)"
"16931","Another list for #ColliderLive to tear apart. :-) 

#ThatsTheShow"
"16932","@Landonsn no i went to  pizza hut with my friend and went to see shazam lol"
"16933","@KEVINTOMIRANDA Saw #Shazam last night and absolutely loved it loved it .... Say my Name?"
"16934","Mom and I went to see #Shazam last night. We used to watch Smallville together all the time too, so seeing @RealJohnGlover in a familiar role was wonderful. Mom got all excited.  Good to see you again man!"
"16935","Neustadter with the easter eggs."
"16936","I just remembered while watching shazam with Mitch, he turns to me and says ""LOOK ITS CAPTAINSPARKLEZ"" and i dont think ill ever forget that"
"16937","I hope that the awesome #ShazamMovie we saw last weekend, directed by @ponysmasher's THE one and ONLY director's cut, much like @ZackSnyder's #ManofSteel. I hope there's no WB Exec meddling with storyline, directions etc. Like Tsugihara did with #BatmanVSuperman &amp; #JusticeLeague"
"16938","2019 is officially the year when RLM shat all over a Marvel movie and then like a week later heaped praise on a DC movie. What the fuck is happening?

Shazam looks super neat."
"16939","My absolute guy crush on @ZacharyLevi is still going strong after #Shazam"
"16940","@Blockbustedpod I guess I have to be the one to say it. Shazam ripped off Kung Fu Panda 2. You know which scene"
"16941","I just watch Shazam tonight and I could really see Jimmy Fallon on Zachary Levi’s acting in the whole movie. <U+0001F92A>"
"16942","Okay everyone keeps comparing Shazam to the original Spider-Man movies and when you look at it that way, it makes total sense and makes me appreciate the movie more"
"16943","@JamesGavsie @AlmightyRay @CreativeXtreme1 @CedricSutton @realroyhuff @SuperheroPOLL @80sThen80sNow @The1stBAT @GeekVibesNation @GeekToMeRadio @The_GWW @CBNostalgia @MikeSchmidt09 @delvin_cox That’s awesome! Shazam all the way!"

"16946","@JamesGavsie @AlmightyRay @CreativeXtreme1 @CedricSutton @realroyhuff @SuperheroPOLL @80sThen80sNow @The1stBAT @GeekVibesNation @GeekToMeRadio @The_GWW @CBNostalgia @MikeSchmidt09 @delvin_cox @mrjafri Depends on if it's composite Sephiroth or just canon. Canon Sephiroth should easily get rocked by Shazam"
"16947","So I have been hearing that Shazam has exceeded people's expectations."
"16948","Just watched Shazam, and it was really awesome dude. Love billy the boy <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> and ah, now I'm sure I draw South park kids in that age."
"16949","I want all people who called shazam meta to point out what specific scene is meta and isn't just part of the characters origins or referenced in Avengers, I'll wait"
"16950","If you're a man on Letterboxd are you are about to write a review for Shazam starting with ""this is the real Captain Marvel"" i really want you to sit down and reevaluate your life choices"
"16951","Hilarious that anyone would think #Shazam couldn't win this."
"16952","There's only one Captain Marvel movie to watch... #SHAZAM!! #SayMyName"
"16953","@The40Watt Man of Steel over Aquaman for me, other than that <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> Still need to see Shazam."
"16954","Even though a bunch of people will :( like Shazam was already getting spoiled over the weekend"
"16955","are we sure SHAZAM is a real movie and not just a collectively imagined movie starring sinbad"
"16956","Person 1: &lt;&lt;writes paragraph about why Shazam isn't worth seeing in the theater&gt;&gt;
Me: Okay, but what should I see.
P1: Literally anything else.   2/4"
"16957","Alright now do a Conjuring / Justice League Dark crossover"
"16958","Young darla in the movie shazam is the cutest jud!"
"16959","He sent his wife to bed and spent the rest of the night with me. He does this most nights. And he never tells his wife. Am I caught up in an affair or something?"
"16960","So #Shazam is straight up the best DCEU movie ever made, I am floored"
"16961","Did you watch anything new over the weekend? Tell us what you thought with a four word film review #dumbo #PetSematary #MissingLinkFilm #ShazamMovie Make sure you tag #myvue #fwfr to be in with the chance of winning a pair of complimentary tickets!"
"16962","@MatthewJaques Wow, I hadn't seen how much you liked Shazam. I haven't seen it yet. Your list was good. I might have Suicide Squad higher up my list. The back half of the movie was a mess but I actually really enjoyed the first half."
"16963","Kind of startled by how much I liked SHAZAM!, though admittedly the scales may have been slightly skewed by the fact that the AVENGERS: ENDGAME trailer played beforehand and reminded me of what a chore these movies can sometimes be."
"16964","But anyway SHAZAM! is a blast: simultaneously a romp through the childhood fantasy of waking up with superpowers and adult privileges and also a sneakily powerful exploration of what constitutes moral fortitude."
"16965","@Heisenherr @FreddyInSpace Yea it feels like this month has a onslaught of major releases. One after the other and sometimes on top of each other like this week with Shazam and Pet Semetary"
"16966","Shazam but for what other people are listening to on the tube"
"16967","@ZacharyLevi did they give you any item of the #shazam set?"
"16968","Daily Shazam! Is great and deserves your money tweet"
"16969","@Onflood_ Lol the oldest movie on that list is a 2017 movie (Captain America)..  I'm not really a movie guy, if it's TV Shows (series), I can be of help, especially for Sitcom.

Netflix movies you can watch; 
Triple Frontier 
Sicaros

Other new movies;
Shazam 
Captain Marvel"
"16970","@ZacharyLevi tomorrow is my bday, can I get a Shazam????<U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"16971","@ZacharyLevi 
 Do you remember Isabela? She loved the movie. Brazil loved the movie too. I hope you come back soon. #Shazam"
"16972","Genuinely curious: Shazam had the worst opening weekend for a modern DC movie and the #55 opening weekend for any superhero movie. Why are all the headlines framing that as a big success? Was it made on a lower budget than most superhero movies?"
"16973","@ZacharyLevi Hellooooo! I'm from Minas Gerais, State of Brazil, the land of ""pão de queijo"", which is food that you loved very much when you were here! Thank you so much for your charisma and congratulations for Shazam, this fun and engaging movie! <U+2665><U+2665><U+2665>"
"16974","Me walking out of Shazam after expecting to love it...

(Turn sound on)"
"16975","The more I think about it the more I feel like it's absolutely insane that Shazam! kept as many secrets as it did during its production and marketing phases"
"16976","@ChxllBrando @Marvel I agree with them taking their time but it’s hard when the actors have other obligations. I enjoyed Aquaman and I’ve only heard great things about Shazam. I hope they make the best decision when it comes to the Flash film."
"16977","@chucktvdotnet @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Well deserved.  Not seen yet but excited for this.  Been waiting for Zach to have this moment since Chuck.  Just hope we still get something from Chuck in the future."
"16978","Had a blast with @CinemaJaw giving our jaws a workout, too, talking the latest movies with @MattKubinski and @Rythemovieguy."
"16979","shazam! is an interesting-ish movie if anyone's seen it. was struck by how it felt like the first superhero movie since the literal maguire spider-man ones to feel unapologetically aimed at kids, is a weird situation for the market to have ended up in"
"16980","im gonna watch shazam tonight <U+0001F60B> ive been waiting for this movie since the trailer came out"
"16981","LMAO this is facts..JL WAS TRASH.."
"16982","just watched shazam, and.. shazam! have to say that, and that deadpool now have a competitor to giving movies and entertainment about family <U+0001F308><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"16983","@ToyaDee78 I am in bed and refusing to come out despite my bladder being ready to explode. Hope to go watch Shazam later. So good"
"16984","Shazam! is a genuinely good, genuinely funny superhero movie and we’ve been missing that for years"
"16985","not that it changes my opinion of the movie

but am i the only one who didn't hear this imaginary Williams theme everyones complaining about?
 I heard something that couldve been half a horn note when he walks in.. but half a horn note a Williams theme does not make
#Shazam"
"16986","Btw guys Shazam is a fun movie. I watched it on Friday and I laughed throughout the whole movie. <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>"
"16987","the mandela effect is real, folks"
"16988","Anybody see #Shazam this weekend and could tell me if it’s worth seeing on the big screen? The DC universe was collapsing last time I checked"
"16989","@ZacharyLevi Just saw Shazam over the weekend. You were MADE for this role!"
"16990","@vuecinemas #ShazamMovie DC is thriving again! #myvuefwfr #fwfr #myvue"
"16991","@rog3lio23 @Crawdaddct I think it came down to not stealing Shazam’s thunder and also not to mislead anyone that might confuse that with The Rock being in the film when he’s not."
"16992","@HiTopFilms At least we got a Superman movie about Superman starring Shazam."
"16993","@ODEONCinemas I saw Shazam! Last Sunday on the 7th. I would describe Shazam! DC comics characters comes to life especially Zachery Levi as Shazam! Lighter funny comedy side than batman or aquaman and finally when DC comics comes to live big screen it makes u excited to see this film!!!<U+0001F600><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"
"16994","@MasterJunpei and I forgot I saw it in imax 3D odeon with my best friend and got a free limited poster for Shazam!"
"16995","I never realized that’s Zachary Levi <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F><U+0001F631>"
"16996","@Ivimey @WordsOfDiana Apologies if you two come to this conclusion later in the show, but a theory I've read on why there were only 6 Shazam kids at the end is that the 7th is Black Adam, which is who the wizard might have teased as the one who used his powers for revenge."
"16997","@Humanloopis My girlfriend is a comic book nerd and she just went “Yeah... it’s Shazam” apparently the people who know about the past info just treat this casual since magic based super power = dark theme and demons? Idk I’m excited now-"
"16998","@sleyheron well you have a bottle near by lol

oh shazam looks pretty funny"
"16999","Aquaman in lead by many strides. Shazam a few steps behind his trail."
"17000","How many times did Mark Strong have to take off his fuckin' sunglasses in SHAZAM? I counted a billion. <U+0001F611>"
"17001","Shazam is a big goofy, corny, super fun film that I adored. It captures the honesty of what would happen if a kid got super powers plus it does a nice job of breaking down and doing a slight deconstruct of superheroes in general. Definitely seeing it again. #Shazam"
"17002","We #deaf moviegoers in #DC love open #captions! Others who like and benefit from captions are welcome to this #IMAX #OC screening of #Shazam this Thursday, April 11th, at 7:55 PM. Please retweet! #accessibility #inclusion"
"17003","@KevinRBrackett @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @ReelSpoilers @reviewstlouis Pet Sematary on Thursday night! And then Basic Instinct on Saturday afternoon."
"17004","i was reading reviews on the shazam movie and most of them said that “it was sexy” then i searched up the cast and ah that’s why"
"17005","Batman : who is calling me?"
"17006","@RevengeOTFans @I_Am_MFR Superman fans still don't have a true win because we have no new solo movie with our fave character announced and starting production any time soon.  Sure, the Shazam cameo was very nice, but it still feels like a hollow victory.  WB just threw us a lil bone but it isn't enough."
"17007","P. S. 
I am loving how nearly every audible review of Shazam is accidentally reffering to him as Captain Marvel"
"17008","""Let's complain about something in a movie that caused you to come out of the experience  and ruin it for everyone else"""
"17009","Am the only person in this Shazam! screening this seems promising"
"17010","@ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi just seen Shazam and I loved it. Such a funny, amazing film. Can't wait to see it again"
"17011","I really want to see more of them
,Not like another movie but a TV show"
"17012","So today we are  going to see @ShaggieKay  opinion on Shazam!
As the main nerd in the squad His reviw is important <U+0001F44D>"
"17013","Ahmmm Why would I choose between these if I can choose to watch them all hihi..."
"17014","Sorry @ZacharyLevi that I doubted Shazam. Can’t wait to meet you anyways next month <U+0001F92A>"
"17015","Despite people said that Aquaman/Shazam is like the best DCEU movie, but i think Man Of Steel is just so perfect to me, the music, the action, damn.. <U+2728>"
"17016","shazam is a christmas movie released in april and that’s reason #42 why it’s bad"
"17017","i was going to watch shazam today but now i have to wait 3 more days thanks i hated it"
"17018","Shazam should just replace the Justice League in the DCEU"
"17019","@mahatesu this is revolutionary, thank you *deletes all the shazam screenshots on my camera roll*"
"17020","Contemplating a Shazam movie night at fuzzy’s in honor of our fav @ZacharyLevi <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"17021","@TheRock can’t wait to see you beat up candyass Superman and Shazam #BlackAdam"
"17022","Literally no one:

Shazam before he learned to fly:"
"17023","I love the Shazam family but I can't wait to see them get crushed by Black Adam's massive thighs"
"17024","#Shazam may have just enough imagery to scare the bejesus out of some very young kids, the horror element is definitely satisfying for us fans of the genre and it has an almost old school ‘80s monster vibe to it. If you’re on the fence about seeing it, GO! It’s fun A F."
"17025","i cant believe families weren’t even an actual thing until shazam came out and showed everyone what they were isn’t that wild"
"17026","@2279acs @jpeaton36 No Shazam here, only Snyder Cut. Thank you."
"17027","boy with luv is impacting radio immediately so we really gotta take advantage of the first week to request it and shazam it (since radios check shazam to decide what to play), hopefully w halsey on it radio will treat us better"
"17028","@NovaFrankly either wasy AQM is thoroughly re watchable, 100% entertaining. I cant really say that for Shazam."
"17029","Anyways Shazam was a great movie and it's been a quite some time since I've had fun in a super hero origin movie"
"17030","The first time I host a #NaaluReviewerumNallaCinemaum! A fun discussion of #Uriyadi2, #NatpeThunai, #KuppathuRaja, #GaneshaMeendumSandhippom, #Shazam and #FightingWithMyFamily with @TheHatmanTweets, @gopi_rajen and @Iamnavein"
"17031","@russburlingame @JoshFialkov @JerryOrdway Seconded. I enjoyed hearing Jerry talk Shazam on @RalphGarman's The Ralph Report pod this morning, too."
"17032","So hey I saw Shazam! last night and it was a really good movie. It was also my first imax movie? And I just need to say that my theater didn’t show the Godzilla footage and honestly what was even the point of the imax after that?"
"17033","#crespohundo2019 #30 #Shazam  Is a great film i want to take my niece and nephew too. I love that the old wiz was a poc! MArk strong is super hot as norm. I excited about found fam being legitimize! Lil sis was a lil annoying but the glow up was real! More OC characters!"
"17034","Liking Captain Marvel over Shazam or vice versa is as much a political statement as choosing Mario or Sonic in the early 90s. Only man children think their taste in media makes them the next MLK."
"17035","@aimiekins But marvel kept pumping books, later added Ms Marvel (carol Danvers among others) and finally killed off Mar-vell and gave the name to Carol in 2009 creating the captain marvel we know now.

Marvel sued DC over the use of the name captain marvel so DC renamed Shazam."
"17036","@ZacharyLevi is a gem - Sitting in a movie theater while 35+ weeks pregnant isn’t the most comfortable thing in the world, but it was worth it to see him in @ShazamMovie <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"

The best DC movie

10/10"
"17039","Hello hi yes when can we talk about Shazam? Because there are two reasons I'm looking forward to a sequel and only one of 'em is Zac."
"17040","Forgot to tweet this yesterday but I really enjoyed Shazam. I'm so glad DC finally brought the New 52 to life with this film. Having been in of my favorite superheroes, I read a lot of the New 52 run of Shazam and loved it, hoping the movie would be like that."
"17041","@vuecinemas #ShazamMovie Good fun - give it a 3 out of 5."
"17042","Shazam was really good and mom wants to watch I w me now too lol"
"17043","YES! I feel the same way. The first half hour does seem to drag on forever."
"17044","just watched @ShazamMovie. for the most part i was holding my chest and laughing my ass off <U+26A1>"
"17045","Please dont watch Shazam . GHAD Its a very stressfull, problematic and SUPER OA na movie!!!"
"17046","It’s April 8 and I haven’t watch @ShazamMovie."
"17047","@zogbaa Then you just watched the movie... captain America was trained by his people. 
Shazam is yet to unveil his true self... before joining the justice league. Now he is just a kid"
"17048","if you think that DC try to change just because shazam is so funny. you are wrong. shazam is so funny because he is originally a kid. imagine a kid become a superhero."
"17049","lil bit sad that the movie didn't even mention shazam's name from the comic books which is captain marvel :("
"17050","gonna see shazam either Wednesday or Thursday !!! super excited <U+0001F62D>"
"17051","Lemme spoil.

Ross Butler is in Shazam.

10/10 would scream internally."
"17052","@scedydesigner @wbpictures @WarnerBrosEnt I believe they added a cameo to secretly tell us that Supes is still around
Maybe it's a hint at a bigger appearance in Shazam sequel?
We'll have to wait and see
#ReleaseTheSnyderCut 
#SuperCav"
"17053","The theater I'm in is playing the original captain marvel show before the shazam movie"
"17054","my best friend would have the ability to help those in need #Shazam  #ShazamXbox"
"17055","@minxmish Both are awesome. Shazam is funny and Dumbo is emotional haha. Depends on your mood xxxx"
"17056","@Allenfire Shazam has tighter writing than Aquaman. A stronger 3rd act than Wonder Woman, better pacing than MOS, sets up future plot lines more cohesively than BvS"
"17057","@Allenfire Never said that, just pointing out what shazam did right that the others didnt"
"17058","@Allenfire Honestly now that i think about it, aquaman is only better than shazam in ambition and scope, but if i am to hold the story of AM to Shazam, I think Shazam is actually a better movie and I LOVE AM."
"17059","Am I the only old fogey who hears ""'Shazam!' has scary parts"" and thinks about the uproar ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or Disney's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" would cause if released today?"
"17060","I love how the Billy's character introduction in Shazam is just him treating authorities like dirt by locking the cops in a store and stealing their lunch. I may have whispered ""legend"" under my breath twice"
"17061","Say me name, say my name...
When @ZacharyLevi around you,
and a Wizard has a snafu,
@djimonhounsou isn’t playing games..."
"17062","Looking forward to seeing this."
"17063","@vuecinemas #myvue #fwfr went to see #shazammovie and it was awesome!!"
"17064","@GailSimone If you enjoyed Shazam that much, you should definitely check out the current on-going series from @geoffjohns @daleeaglesham @SEN1227, it's got all the heart and fun of the film, and expands upon it! I've been reviewing the series for @oncomicsground and it's been a blast!"
"17065","One of my all-time FAVOURITE villains! 

I love this little larvea! :)"
"17066","Why didn’t Dwayne Johnson, the master of hyping his fans with his social media presence, make a single post prior to the release of Shazam telling them that he was involved and that they should see it"
"17067","man of steel/wonder woman
batman v superman/aquaman
shazam
justice league
suicide squad"
"17068","What’s my super power? It’s running away from the seven deadly sins #ShazamMovie #sevendeadlysins #SuperPowers"
"17069","Fat Jokes are considered fatphobia now lmao."
"17070","Ppl getting overtly worked up over media marketed primarily towards children is the best thing. Sorry Shazam didn't kill a few guys and drop a cluster f-bomb on screen."
"17071","Great explanation!"
"17072","Captain Marvel makes $153 million on opening weekend. Has made over $1 billion worldwide. 

Comicsgate: This movie sucks. It’s a complete failure. This is the end of the MCU.

Shazam makes $53 million on opening weekend.

Comiscgate: The REAL Captain Marvel! What a success!"
"17073","Keenly anticipating that @mrandmrsmovie Shazam review. Where it at?"
"17074","@ZacharyLevi is living proof that DC can cast the perfect actor and also make an amazing film, Shazam was something else"
"17075","@jezzerzeus @JustinQuizon Same. Both had their hiccups, but Shazam was better at smoothing then out."
"17076","Good morning! Anyone wanna recreate the scene from Shazam where all the single pretty ladies enter my DMs"
"17077","@Chris50345887 @XMenFilms I know what you mean I though the same of the international trailer. Then I saw it when I went to see Shazam, and there godly up there on the big screen!!"
"17078","With the exception of Shazam(because I haven't seen it), I endorse this list."
"17079","Well,  Shazam should be a good movie.

Let's see what happens. <U+0001F37F> <U+0001F37F> <U+0001F37F>"
"17080","But,  what if sometimes I want to just say the word shazam without actually turning to shazam tho? <U+0001F914> <U+0001F914> <U+0001F914>"
"17081","@Bosslogic @TheRock i think the sequel to Shazam will definitely be Mister Mind, that’s why Black Adam is getting his own movie!"
"17082","@wbshopUK Great #Shazam products! <U+0001F60A>"
"17083","This movie is great!! So yeah! Go watch it!"

"17095","I've seen Shazam be compared three times to Sam Raimi's Spiderman and damn that's some high praise. Can't wait to see it. Superhero films need more cheesiness."
"17096","About to watch Shazam with @ZacharyLevi I'm so excited!!!"
"17097","literally reading any shazam comic is just like. someone come love and care for this infant!! can i get a concerned and compassionate adult in here PLEASE"

"17102","Having not seen either of them, should I watch #CaptainMarvel or #Shazam tonight?
#Marvel #DC #comics #geek"
"17103","@theisb #whatsupchris Since Crisis, DC has integrated the universes (Carlton, Fawcett, Wildstorm) it acquires into the main one. Taking Shazam as example, what works better, full integration (regular meeting Superman), leaving their own corner except for big events or separate universe?"
"17104","I didnt even know about the @aquamanmovie scene"
"17105","Something I’ve been thinking about since watching SHAZAM! is how much I love fun, heartfelt teen superhero movies like this one (and of course Spider-Man: HoCo) and how unfair it is that we don’t get to have stories like these about teen girls"
"17106","Man, Shazam was just delightful. What a fun movie.
Loved it from top to toe."
"17107","@filmmadfinn @Bosslogic @TheRock Or maybe Mister Mind and Sivana together free Adam from wherever he is trapped! Something similar to the events of Shazam: The New Beginning.... though in that series it was only Sivana!"
"17108","Thank you to your son, Gail. Going to go see #Shazam <U+0001F44C>"
"17109","@bumbum_G It was really good! Watched both captain marvel and Shazam and definitely Shazam was much more fun to watch"
"17110","Just watched #Shazam today and it was a blast!! Super fun and interesting with many comic references. Really enjoyed it. Plus, a brilliant score from @benwallfisch! @ponysmasher <U+0001F4AF>"
"17111","@RoxyfromGotham @ZacharyLevi Can’t wait to take my son after school. I bet he’ll like it and Shazam everywhere he goes. I can’t wait either."
"17112","i'm so glad both captain marvel and shazam are doing good in the box office"
"17113","watching shazam and us today"
"17114","esok, both my brothers are off from work. guess who'll be watching Shazam?"
"17115","Oh no I'm starting to see negative opinions for #Shazam!!!! I thought it was just universally agreed that it was great? No? Was that just what I thought?"
"17116","I think this is the first non-positive opinion I've heard about Shazam."
"17117","Jarring editing??? TV level cinematography??? Excuse me, what?"
"17118","O!!! M!!! G!!! That ending and mid-credit scene. <U+0001F631> #Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"17119","Found the song all thanks to the human Shazam <U+0001F62D><U+2764><U+FE0F> i can finally go to sleep @thekidvalentine"
"17120","what has one to do with another"
"17121","I neeeed to watch this, someone credit my account"
"17122","@AwesomEmergency so I finally got to watch Shazam, and I was on IMDb trying to figure out a *spoiler actor” and he’s credited as who he plays before the the main character"
"17123","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Legend supporting a legend how sweet!"
"17124","it sucked for a long time, but learning to navigate it helped me become strong in different ways.

so the point of all this is, some people can't handle movies like shazam. and that's okay."
"17125","when someone is highly sensitive, they develop most healthfully when they're not made to feel like that sensitivity is a flaw and a defect, and when they're given the freedom to decide what they allow into their circle.

so. go enjoy shazam! or don't! but..."
"17126","i live in philly and during #Shazam at the first philly establishing shot there was one person in the audience who clapped one time, obviously trying to start something, and then immediately stopped when nobody joined him and it was the most philadelphia thing ever"
"17127","“All modern superhero movies are good.”

Fant4stic exists. So this is clearly false."
"17128","can someone check up on geoff johns"
"17129","@michaelmaycomix The trailer for that Bautista and a little kid movie showed before our viewing of Shazam. It was a big hit with my family. I’m still leery."
"17130","@MatthewBouman1 Shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy are so desperate to get people to watch the show they have to act like they're still relevant by making references to modern pop culture just so they can seem cool. The only non cringey use of the floss dance I have seen is Shazam."
"17131","@ponysmasher I saw you sneaked in Annabelle doll in cop vs billy scene and you made Shazam say the words lights-out to Freddy. Any other references I am missing out?"
"17132","@GetFlexSeal Please stop leaks for Shazam and Captain Marvel <U+0001F614>"
"17133","@dailyspiidey Spider-Man: Homecoming walked so Shazam could take some vague elements from it and make a way better movie"
"17134","Shazam! credits reminded me of Spider-Man Homecoming"
"17135","I’m going feral I can’t see Shazam until maybe tomorrow.... I’ve never wanted to be able to drive so bad"
"17136","@MeechyDarko_ shazam and i have a personal relationship and endgame i haven’t seen anything to sell me"
"17137","when Shazam comes out on dvd i WILL need to find a download of it.... i have some amv ideas"
"17138","i’m homophobic because with Shazam’s gay character my first instinct was “now people are gonna hate this movie” dndhajsbajsb"
"17139","I need to rewatch Shazam because i have something to say but i cant remember if its true or not"
"17140","My review of the very fun #Shazam! <U+0001F9D9><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"17141","Quick and dirty movie review of Shazam = Very good. Lots of humor, addresses the excellent question of how does a new superhero even know his/her powers and how to use them. Notice the recent surge in foster families and adoption in movies? End a bit messy. About 8 out of 10."
"17142","Watching Half in the Bag on Shazam and Jay just made a comparison to Sam Raimi

I excite"
"17143","#nw Shazam. Cant imagine being disappointed in this, but only because the bar is so low."
"17144","shazam bagus, but kinda boring in some parts"
"17145","@Shazam Hi. Can you tell me who I need to get in touch with at Shazam with regard to using your QR code in press ads?"
"17146","The Shazam review we deserve, we need, and the one that matters."
"17147","The Shazam review we deserve, we need, and the one that matters. 
Oh, and there's SPOILERS in here. So don't read if you haven't seen."
"17148","Id give Shazam a 7/10. Group home actors were perfect, was very close to the comics and was a well paced movie overall. Zacharay Levi was good, but a little too animated and high energy compared to kid Billy."
"17149","billy petson"
"17150","@GailSimone Shazam and Isis are the first 2 superheroes that I ever saw on TV. So yeah, this hero holds a special place in my heart for sure. Can't wait to see the film."
"17151","SHAZAM: Charming, lots of fun. Takes a bit too long to get started, and again, the action climax is way too long. Not as consistently excellent as Spider-verse, but full of delights."
"17152","almost talked myself out of rewatching SHAZAM today on the basis of then not having to sit through the stuupid, Stupid! ugly ""send thoughts and prayers to my kid who fell through the ice"" movie trailer again               . god, it is ugly"
"17153","Was the Shazam movie supposed to come out during Christmas? That Santa got a lot of screen time"
"17154","“They’re both movies about kids so obviously Shazam copies HC” lmao get outta here"
"17155","@Haitian_Sensei @Diego_V41 Well they've got a few notches under their belt now. DP, Shazam, WW and Aquaman. Titans to a mild extent"

"17160","@Mister_BatfIeck Shazam! is the movie that Homecoming wanted to be."
"17161","Saw #Us and #Shazam this weekend, can’t decide which was scarier, think I know which was a better movie tho, lol @_fireresistant"
"17162","@FriendlessMean I have question. How do you keep from feeling burnt out on so much mediocre comic book adaptations? I don’t even wanna touch Aquaman or Shazam."
"17163","me starting any conversation this week: hey did u see shazam????"
"17164","@CheshireCat506 @alex_segura Tragic. That said, I had to see #Shazam by myself on Saturday so I can fully relate!"
"17165","@TheIanChen Oh my god I really enjoy watching #SHAZAM"
"17166","wait, what have I missed ???"
"17167","#SHAZAM is now my favourite DC movie. I loved it, the kid loved it, it's great fun."
"17168","@Mister_BatfIeck Shazam has more emotions and heartfelt moments than Homecoming could ever have. Michael Keaton is the only thing good."
"17169","It was heartfelt, funny and discovering the true meaning of family. Shazam was just perfect."
"17170","Gail is saying good things about The Marvel Family, cosigning!"
"17171","I'm looking to publish reviews of #Shazam , #TheSistersBrothers and #Dumbo to @thefilmagazine this week. If you have one ready to go and would like it to be shared to our vast audience, get in touch via DM or @ josephwade@thefilmagazine.com

"17172","If I had to make a review of Shazam in just 15 words, I would..."
"17173","This is awesome."
"17174","Shazam is a great movie! Excited for the joker movie to come out."
"17175","Has anyone seen #SHAZAM? Is Billy the total monster he is from New52?"
"17176","Shazam was SO DAMN GOOD and OH NO I need to make that dress"
"17177","This was actually surprisingly good. Definitely recommend"
"17178","@FreyjaErlings TLDR; black autistic kid finds magic transforming god of weapons, becomes Not!Shazam, gets involved in crazy cosmic war, learns to do magic kung fu bullshit, becomes god of martial arts, valor and compassion."
"17179","In every way that the movie ""Shazam!"" differed from my expectations as a comic reader, I found delightful."
"17180","Best part of Shazam

Say my name!! 

Billy! <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"17181","These have been so great, keep them coming!"
"17182","Shazam had no business being that good and HILARIOUS, an amazing super hero film"
"17183","“Shazam!” tells a universal truth no other superhero movie has been brave enough to confront: dudes in trucks are the worst.

But really it was fun and touching from beginning to end and @ZacharyLevi is magnificent so go see it plz."
"17184","someone take me to see shazam movie I’m dying"
"17185","Shazam! Was fantastic!
Like, ""top 10 super hero movies of all time"" good. 
Watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse afterwards to keep the hope and joy train rolling."
"17186","When the wizard tells the story of Shazam to Billy, he mentions that the last person they gave the powers to used it for vengeance and evil, who released the seven deadly sins. 

Could THAT be this version of Black Adam?"
"17187","@benshapiro just name dropped @redlettermedia when discussing #Shazam! Worlds are colliding!"
"17188","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie So kind of you! You guys are amazing and inspiring people as much as the characters! Success always. <U+263A><U+0001F44D><U+0001F600><U+0001F64C>"
"17189","@johnnyp313 @jezzerzeus Shazam! Third act made me grin like an idiot for the rest of the movie.

But Captain Marvel’s final confrontation with Yon-Rogg made me smile just as big. 

They’re vastly different movies to me, that give me different enjoyments."
"17190","There’s zero comparisons to be made. They’re nothing alike. They’re both good movies let’s move on."
"17191","@OhNoRobertLuke I liked Aquaman. It wasn’t perfect, but it was fun and vibrant and silly in a way the marvel movies have never even tried. I’d easily watch Aquaman again over Infinity War. Shazam was fun too, perhaps a better movie than Aquaman, but also filled with jokes that are aimed younger"
"17192","@OhNoRobertLuke Like, seeing Shazam in an audience of children yesterday really was able to contextualize how I felt about the film. I was like “sure that was fun, and I hope kids love it, but this property will maybe never be for me, really”."
"17193","This week's episode of Cinemaholics with @ryollie90 might honestly be one of my favorites to date. We really get into a lot this week, talking about SHAZAM!, PET SEMATARY, UNICORN STORE, THE INVENTOR, SHRILL and a whole lot more."
"17194","@INOXMovies @ShazamMovie @warnerbrosindia @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial @wbpictures I would give #Shazam a 10/10 because it's that good"

"17196","@lalisshibuya @ygofficialblink Yes. Spotify and Shazam helps a lot fam :)"
"17197","WAIT! Shazam is the best Justice league movie DC has done yet!!!! like i thought it was just a little slow but the last quarter of the movie omggg <U+0001F947><U+0001F947><U+0001F947>"
"17198","@ZacharyLevi repping for the 805!!! Congrats man @ShazamMovie is so much fun.  @TheRock you jumping in this train yet?"
"17199","@TheQuartering How Shazam is doing much better than Captain Marvel, maybe add a bit of trolling on how Shazam is the true captain marvel or something <U+0001F481><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"17200","@breatheonmebrit @Dcfrontier234 @GiteshPandya The sat drop of fantastic 4 was 24% te shazam one is 3.5%. Lmao"
"17201","The kids in Shazam (live action) were really annoying. Then I remembered in Flashpoint Paradox (when they were all Shazam) where they got killed by Wonder Woman. Ahh. Serenity <U+0001F60C>"
"17202","SHAZAM! Is one of the best super-hero movies ever made. Not because it spends huge loads of money in CGI, but because it spends right on something we sorely miss: the joyness and the consequences of being a super-hero. SO GREAT. @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi #shazam"
"17203","ignore every terrible review about shazam it was hilarious and the story can still stand on its own if you were to remove the comedy"
"17204","@BatmanNewsCom Shazam made me believe it's actually happening."
"17205","Another great perspective on #Shazam from a different POV."
"17206","Insightful read on the depiction of Freddy Freeman in #Shazam. Fed give it a read, no matter your feelings on the film."
"17207","@GatesTemple It's such a bizzare Easter egg that I'm surprised I've seen no one on here reference despite all the Shazam talk.

 That's a cinematic universe no one anticipated."
"17208","Honored to talk SHAZAM! and PET SEMATARY with @thewillofash and @JonNegroni on this week’s episode of @Cinemaholicspod!"
"17209","@DCComics marketed @ShazamMovie as a funny kid-friendly-super-hero film.  It wasn’t.  Why all the cuss words?  What do u get out of scandalizing kids? A scary movie with satanic-looking creatures. Parents, don’t take your children. @CommonSense #ShazamMovie #shazam"
"17210","@officialmcafee @theemrsmcafee It was so beautiful <U+0001F600> Tried to get the 'name/reference' of the music through Shazam. Needless to say the app could not come up with anything! <U+0001F604>"

"17219","Perhaps I’m not a fan of #Shazam I know the guy is cute but watching the movie was like a Nickelodeon. Movies need to be more worthwhile and cinemas have to step up with experience. Watching in @netflix is really more practical and I can still have my dogs <U+0001F436> with me <U+0001F917>"

"17257","Thread. While I read a lot of comics (a lot, cats, like a lot a lot), this is not one I'm super familiar with. Been reading the new run and enjoying it, but this was the first superhero movie in a while that I picked up no Easter eggs. And now I want to go back and read this book"

"17260","Shazam! has an estimated production budget of $80 million plus $80-$150 million in marketting. It's international gross currently sits at $156 million, and, even if WB spent the max estimate marketting budget, it will likely begin turning a profit by the end of next week."
"17261","Shazam's estimates were anywhere between $40-$50 million for its opening. $52 million broke WB's estimate, so they're rightfully happy. 

Sony had hoped Ghostbusters (2016) would make $60-$70 million its opening weekend. It didn't crack $50 million, and Sony went into a panic."
"17262","I personally think Sony made poor financial decisions Ghostbusters (2016), and it should have been produced in a similar budget range to Shazam, in which case, yes: it would have been a profitable film and we'd be talking about its sequel."
"17263","@mediumppodcast #Shazam #UsMovie and probably #Endgame"

"17265","Got to see #Shazam yesterday. I have always liked the Shazam story, and #ZacharyLevi did a really great job of conveying the wonder and excitement of the part."
"17266","I want to see Shazam, but the good movie theatre's are only showing it in standard like twice a day. I dont think the movie us 6 hours long, but this is ridiculous. I'm not paying $15 to see it"
"17267","@TheCollector198 I just think it's how relatable a character and style can be.
Some people relate to Shazam easier <U+0001F937>
That's why I don't like ranking them. They're so different yet I love them all."

But when the Shazam family came to life in the movie “Shazam” all I can think about is how they all got murdered by Wonder Woman in Flashpoint Paradox"

"17282","I love Spider-Man Homecoming as a teen romdram that offers insight into the man of the street's perspective of the MCU but Shazam gets the edge for putting more effort into bundling up the hero's corner of the world."

Cheers, Terry"
"17295","@GailSimone 100% concur. Shazam blew me away. I'm glad to hear it had the same impact on people deeply invested in the characters as it did on me (who never read the series)."
"17296","(Shazam is good as hell btw I 100% recommend it)"
"17297","More I dive into the Twitterverse I realize that @ZacharyLevi could be new @kevinbacon on account of 6 degrees of separation theory.

"17298","Shazam! is a whole heap of fun"
"17299","I'll wait until more people have seen Shazam before making any real commentary, but I will say it did one thing right that superhero movies have traditionally been really bad about that makes me love it even more"
"17300","@GailSimone I firmly believe that in 30 years a whole generation will talk about Shazam in the same way that my generation talks about Princess Bride and The Goonies.

It's just one of those film that leaves you feeling so much better coming out than you did going in."
"17301","Edge lord is probably too harsh a term for shazam but I certainly feel people describing it as deadpool-lite"
"17302","Just sat down for a second viewing of #SHAZAM! I LOVE this movie, so very much. It has heart, it's got a great story and characters and @ZacharyLevi is a legit superhero. I'm so glad #dc and @wbpictures are taking a different direction. They're 2 for 2!!! #superheros #movies"

"17308","@KevinRBrackett @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @ReelSpoilers @reviewstlouis That is good to hear. A couple people I know saw it opening night and they said it was just okay, but not really worth it. Yet, some people on campus said it was pretty good and if you like the twisted scenes in the original, you may consider the remake."
"17309","@KevinRBrackett @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @ReelSpoilers @reviewstlouis I watched the 89 Pet Sematary because my dad never seen it before. He wanted to see the original before watching the remake. Two weeks ago I seen US and I personally thought it was a very good film. I also seen Five Feet Apart and it was good. Damn near made me cry twice."
"17310","I'm about to go see Shazam! Stream will be when I get home, also been trying to find the GoT oreos to no luck xD"
"17311","So glad Shazam is finally out, now I’ll never have to watch that stupid trailer again when I go to the movies."
"17312","Okay, if Adam Serwer likes Shazam, that's decisive. (He may not understand this rule; I don't; understanding is not necessary; it will just get me in the door.)"
"17313","I liked Shazam, it was light and fun! Very much like Aquaman, only where Aquaman felt more like a fairy tale adventure, Shazam is more of a family comedy. I really enjoyed the cast, too."

"17316","Is Shazam gay in the comic???"
"17317","@ZacharyLevi My kid &amp; I saw @ShazamMovie this weekend! Great movie, great job, very entertaining! Thx for bringing #Shazam to the Big Screen! Looking forward to seeing you in #Shazam2 &amp; in the next #JusticeLeague  
If anyone hasn’t seen it, it’s a great family movie!"
"17318","@GailSimone Totally agree! I LOVE your take on this movie. One of the better written and directed superhero movie made. Watched it 2 weeks ago on the early screenings and have booked tickets to watch it this week! #ShazamMovie"
"17319","Retweeting this again to show one of the reasons why I admire @ZacharyLevi <U+2639><U+FE0F> My heart is so full <U+0001F62D> You can also see in his interviews and other vids that he really is Shazam. He’s literally a 14-year-old in a grown up’s body <U+0001F923>"
"17320","All of this. I agree with all of this."

"17323","#Shazam was a great and fun film (beats the crap out of bland &amp; awful #CaptainMarvel), but I'd prefer it if #AsherAngel looked less like #AryaStark.
It's disconcerting."
"17324","@ponysmasher You did a good job with making ""Shazam!"" and using @blumspew, @DarinDePaul, and @FredTatasciore as the voices of the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. Will you be reprising Mister Mind if ""Shazam!"" gets some sequels like one that has the Monster Society of Evil in it?"

"17338","I finally will be seeing shazam in a few hours"
"17339","Oh the irony"
"17340","@UberKryptonian I wish he was the villain of Shazam. The weakest link was the generic Mark Strong villain."
"17341","Shazam is a dumb name. 
I just think that if I can have more than one friend named Dan, that maybe the world can handle having two superheroes named #CaptainMarvel. Thats all I'm saying. #SHAZAM"

"17440","Why do we Shazam? <U+0001F914>

Western artists encourage Shazam to help with a song's success. Shazams affect radio play, which counts for Hot 100. Tour planners also often look at sales, streaming, &amp; Shazam numbers to decide where artists may hold an event. <U+0001F506>

"17499","Controversial opinion. While I enjoyed Shazam a lot and would watch it again, Captain Marvel is a superior movie in my eyes. Shazam was not sure on the age appropriate group while Captain Marvel was on message the whole time. #nonspoilerhottake"

"17505","The grim/dark elements of Shazam was perfect. Sandberg made sure you knew his horror roots &amp; I fucking loved it."
"17506","In some ways it is, in some ways Aquaman better. Both premium GAS regardless peep it bro"

"17510","Actually this shit trash."
"17511","@ZacharyLevi It may be some time before it comes to a full realization but I truly believe that @ZacharyLevi will become to nowadays kids what Christopher Reeve performing wholesome, joyful, fun &amp; funny #Superman was back in 1978 for my generation. Also, #Shazam!"
"17512","Just watched Shazam! So far with Wonder Woman, Aquaman for the best DC films yet. 4/5 <U+2B50><U+FE0F>"
"17513","Jack Dylan Grazer and @ZacharyLevi have so much chemistry together, they’re both super fun! Mark Strong’s take on Doctor Sivana is cool, it’s a very enjoyable performance. The movie touches on every little thing a Shazam fan would want to see, so, you won’t be disappointed!"
"17514","Let’s talk about the #Shazam! movie. The creative team behind this movie is AMAZING, it’s (in my opinion) the best DC movie so far. It’s fun, emotionally deep, joyful, the cast has incredible on-screen chemistry and you leave the theatre wanting more. 

You’ll have a great time."
"17515","@cineworld I'm an unlimited customer and was so disappointed I couldn't see Shazam at Didsbury this week without having to pay for Screen X, superscreen or 4DX. I just want to watch a normal screening!"

home: coming"
"17517","Looks at Shazam: sir this is my emotional support super hero movie"
"17518","Just watched #Shazam for the second time, this time with my brother. I really liked it first time but this time, I loved it and that for me is so important to be a great film. Well done @ZacharyLevi for delivering an old school yet fresh superhero movie! <U+26A1><U+26A1><U+26A1>"
"17519","and yet"
"17520","@chiefsxbo Big bet, I’ve been waitin on Shazam since the first trailer, I told niggas it was gone be hard and they ain’t wanna believe me but I had faith"
"17521","y’all hyping up shazam will realize the bland mediocrity of it in a couple months. y’all are just hyped because it’s new and fresh."
"17522","I never thought I'd say this but there would be no better DC team up movie than Aquaman/Shazam"
"17523","There is a scene in the wonderful #Shazam that is gonna be the Shoe Getting Dipped in ROGER RABBIT for a lot of kids"
"17524","Shazam is a superhero movie about a guy who always knows what song is playing at Urban Outfitters"
"17525","Also, people have asked me: ‘can I see Shazam without having seen other DC films?’ Do you KNOW how satisfying it is to answer ‘no, you don’t - it stands on its own’ to that? I love the MCU, but I do miss films that are able to stand alone and tell their own stories."
"17526","I just can’t get over how perfect @ZacharyLevi is as Shazam, himself. Watching him on screen was like watching Christopher Reeve as Superman; it’s going to go down as an iconic performance. I’m so pleased for the guy, I’ve loved him since Tangled and I want him in ALL the movies."
"17527","Rewatching Shazam reaffirmed one of my favourite things to see in a superhero movie which tbh even Marvel forget to do often: showing the heroes fucking save people and how said saved citizens react to them. Makes me fucking well up, man."
"17528","@DanielMazz1 @ShowcaseCinemas Not really bothered by 4D plus I'm seeing it with my friend who loves Hellboy as much as me. If it's as good as I hope maybe we could go together or see Shazam :)"

"17532","@agentfitz777 I loved Shazam, saw it twice already."
"17533","@AmazonChique What a ridiculous comparison, Shazam cost 80-100 million where’s Ghostbusters cost nearly double that. Breaking news for you, it’s  about the quality of film, not gender issues."
"17534","@ZacharyLevi It's the best movie of the year so far. Don't tell Marvel, because I named my son after one of their characters, but #Shazam is my new favorite movie. <U+26A1><U+0001F48B><U+0001F496> Congrats all around for all your hard work."
"17535","Well turns out Shazam really was a childrens movie, which is the last thing I expected out of DC.
That'll teach me to actually go see the movie instead of just watching reviews on Youtube."

"17558","Saw #Shazam and it was REALLY enjoyable! I got a lot of Sam Raimi Spider-Man 1&amp;2 vibes which was great! DC doesn't have to be all dark or all humor, it's whatever fits the character. 

Also this movie finally helps disprove the ""@RottenTomatoes only likes @Marvel movies!"" excuse."

"17596","Reading some spoilers for Shazam and... I HAVE to see this movie. That we're gonna [REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED] is not something I expected at all, especially from a studio that until recently wanted everyone to be Miller's Batman."
"17597","it’s no.1 movie in the world now sit down"
"17598","Currently chanting to myself that I have food at home, and I shouldn’t stop at Taco Bell after work because wouldn’t I rather had money to see Shazam and go to the Arts Festival.
Ugh."
"17599","@TheCollector198 @getFANDOM @Detectives214 @TheRock So basically it takes Shazam+Superman to beat Black Adam. That's one powerful supervillain."
"17600","@thatgeekn_kidd @XanmanComicGame @getFANDOM @TheRock I think he selected Black Adam. Was initially approached for Shazam."
"17601","@BiZAhrOh @Ajepart1 @getFANDOM Yeah it's really bizzare. His ex wife Dany Garcia is an executive producer of Shazam. But both of them didn't even acknowledge the movie. Maybe he is doing now because Black Adam is greenlight after success of Shazam."
"17602","The story from Kahndaq is coming soon. @gansjay"
"17603","Well you have to look at money made they dont care about USA anymore its all about  Overseas dollars which is becoming billions more than United States"
"17604","Undoubtedly. A surprise runaway hit that marks three straight for @DCComics! Really excited to see the direction the #DCEU is heading."
"17605","Is it just me or does @ShazamMovie just seem like a complete and total rip-off of #BIG w/ #TomHanks?"
"17606","@BenBSinger Shazam Vs Thor would have been better in my opinion, but these guys know what their doing."
"17607","@dailyspiidey Yeah but the same can be said about Captain Marvel a thousand times over because Shazam is actually good and captain marvel which was hyped up was mediocre piss poor trash"
"17608","@ZacharyLevi Loved it, my man! The kids were awesome, and you made a cracking Shazam! Mark Strong was a great foil, too. Fantastic family fun and feels! <U+0001F602>"
"17609","Lmfao why are ppl so pressed abt others enjoying a dc movie"
"17610","There are millions of new Shazam fans today."
"17611","@tothestars17 I'm a fan of both Marvel and DC, but Shazam is my dad's #1 favorite character and it makes me so happy that people are seeing why he loved the character for nearly 80 years."
"17612","@ZacharyLevi Congrats! Thank you, @ponysmasher and all @ShazamMovie cast &amp; crew for this AMAZING movie <U+0001F499>"
"17613","i love this man sm"
"17614","Shazam was an amazing movie. Hoping that these movies are a sign of DC getting everything together."
"17615","@CymruNerdCave Because they are everywhere. Was asked to go and see Shazam! On Saturday. When I said I didn't  really like superhero films. I then got a list of superhero films fired at me. With the belief I must like at least one. No Karen I really fucking don't."
"17616","Shazam really is a lot like the old Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies and that’s a pretty good bar to reach right there"
"17617","trey get off the drugs, I love HC too, but Shazam isn't a copy of HC. 

also follow back Cheddar"
"17618","@SlopeOfHope 
Tim, saw this and thought of You."
"17619","@May15thProphecy Thursday at five Shazam"
"17620","@PRAISO1 Game of thrones has overshadowed Shazam tbh"
"17621","@MarvelStudios you really didn't do Shazam? Cause I think you just send someone to do everything there and then say that it was DC. Shazam is a cool movie, and it was released week after I saw captain marvel,witch means I seen captain marvel twice, if you know what I mean"
"17622","@BlakeNorthcott I loved it and I hope it financially succeeds because I want to see how the story continues. 

What did you think of Shazam?"
"17623","@ZacharyLevi no thank you zachary, you brought one of my favorite heroes to life. your portrayal of shazam was everything i imagined and more. i had to see that movie and ill probably see it three more times. so proud of you!!"
"17624","@MooreLf9882 just to let you know your Shazam autograph was posted this evening recorded delivery you should get Wednesday! Thank you #shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"17625","I almost cried reading this. Captain ""Big Red Cheese"" Marvel/Shazam was one of my first true superhero loves as a kid. I'm so happy to hear that they've done right by him and the rest of the Marvel Family."
"17626","@kakapotrainer It's a great family friendly movie and even tho this is based on the Geoff Johns and Gary Frank stuff it still has a lot of the heart and love of the classic Shazam/Captain Marvel and the adopted family is so touching I literally cried"
"17627","the fact shazam is literally being called the best and most fun superhero movie ever made is just...... <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F97A>"
"17628","someone really has major fkn shazam spoilers as their header and icon dude wtf"
"17629","the fact shazam is literally being the best and most fun superhero movie ever made is just...... <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F97A>"
"17630","if anyone wants to see shazam i’ll go again with you!!!! lmk!!! <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"17631","Zachary Levi is so happy and grateful to play Shazam that I want to give him my money by watching Shazam just because que looks beyond grateful"
"17632","When this becomes available in thru @Spotify it'll gonna blow up. I swear.
#PersonaTrackist"
"17633","Shazam was not as bad I thought it was gonna be. That’s probably the best compliment I could give."
"17634","""...that’s just the bees-knees y’all. The beesiest of knees."" ~Zachary Levi

I thought I was the only one who used beesiest! Lol! Can't wait to watch this with The Kid!"
"17635","Go see SHAZAM so WB knows to come out with more well written DC films that have great character arcs and charming themes. Enough of this sloppy writing bs that has gone on for way too long in DCEU."
"17636","Go see SHAZAM so we WB knows to come out with more well written DC films that have great character arcs and charming themes. Enough of this sloppy writing bs that has gone on for way too long in DCEU."
"17637","@KindaFunnyKevin @TheDCUniverse @SadBoyBarrett Hey Kevin is everyone doing a Review for Shazam or is it just for screencast? Loved the episode btw"
"17638","I have a free evening tomorrow night. Might go see #ShazamMovie again. It was very good. @ZacharyLevi is very good, and the most niche mid credit scene in a while."
"17639","@SocMediaSaint Yep. You know if it had been him, everyone who's complaining would claim Shazam is a masterpiece."
"17640","Because they both have teenage superheroes?"
"17641","In the spanish dub of Shazam, the guys that did the spanish voice of both Billy Baston and Freddy Freeman are also the same guys that dub Clyde and Lincoln respectively"
"17642","I'm hoping to see Shazam on Wednesday."
"17643","this is mcdonald drive thru"
"17644","@ZacharyLevi I have been in the cinema 2 times, for watch the same movie, guess it.... Shazam!"
"17645","@ShazamMovie deserves this @ZacharyLevi you were awesome un that movie! Totally loved ir!"
"17646","@ZacharyLevi first you killed it in chuck and now you killed it in @ShazamMovie you are one of my favorite actors. Keep up the great work. Go see this movie. #ShazamMovie"
"17647","@ZacharyLevi I just watched shazam! and i love you so much"
"17648","I saw Shazam this weekend and it was mostly very charming but I have the dumbest possible problem with it - the end credits were a total ripoff of the Spider-Man: Homecoming end credits."
"17649","I am acc. a sweet sister.

Went to watch shazam, bought ticket then i remembered im not a superhero person.
Called my brother to comman take the ticket then i gave him extra money for refreshment. 

And I didn't get a Thank you <U+0001F612>"
"17650","Even though sitting in a movie theater while 35+ weeks pregnant wasn’t the most comfortable thing in the world, it was totally worth it to see @ZacharyLevi in @ShazamMovie this weekend <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"17651","So I watched Shazam last night, and honestly?
I think it's my new favorite superhero movie, i didn't expect to love it as much as i did.
#Shazam"
"17652","@ZacharyLevi here is my proof that I did see the movie yesterday! Gave me all 4 season of emotions!!!! <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> #SHAZAM love you all, you filthy animals!!! @AsherAngel @Jgrazerofficial <U+0001F91F><U+0001F91F><U+0001F91F><U+0001F91F>"
"17653","@stevenmkeller @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @ReelSpoilers @reviewstlouis Seeing The Beach Bum today. I hope it's good!"
"17654","Well congrats to @ZacharyLevi on #SHAZAM heard great things, gotta wait to watch <U+0001F62D> But can’t wait!"
"17655","@CurzonCbury No Shazam??<U+0001F622> is it not coming at all?? Don’t tell me I actually have to consider another cinema"
"17656","New episode is LIVE! We talk about #Shazam, a new @assassinscreed game codenamed ""Kingdom"" and the big topic is all about Game Difficulties"
"17657","If you seen Shazam, go read the 29 plus tweets by Gail Simone. I agree 110 percent.  Movie was fantastic. Go see @ShazamMovie"
"17658","I actually prefer the Shazam movie over Captain Marvel."
"17659","@chiefsxbo I seen it twice and it was fire!! Shazam family was perfectly casted kids and adults. Megan Good always gonna be bad to me but Mary Marvel was HOT!!"
"17660","Maybe Ghostbusters 2016 was just a small hey lets do this fun thing to begin with. 
Also why are y'all so quick to forget Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman exist &amp; each made enough money to enable Disney and Warner share holders to buy a small country. White feminism man."
"17661","@russburlingame @JerryOrdway Actually reading The Power of Shazam by @JerryOrdway right after watching the movie!"
"17662","@ZacharyLevi congrats to you and the Shazam! team. Crazy good. Hope to see more!"
"17663","If it makes less than it cost to make and market it then it's a flop."
"17664","@BeccaMoya @LaylaHergert While I will say Shazam was a quality movie I still feel like Marvel still puts out movies with better story lines than that of dc"
"17665","Secondly if you haven't seen SHAZAM, I advise you keep it that way. Shalom."
"17666","Rip to Merlin from Kingsman for he was reborn as the super bad guy in Shazam and @ZacharyLevi had to beat him up"
"17667","I’m about to watch #Shazam I’m looking forward to it <U+0001F600>"
"17668","@GiteshPandya Bigger than Ant-Man in the following countries:
Mexico
Russia
Brazil
Indonesia
Korea
Italy
Thailand
UAE
Spain

I guess #Shazam is a flop after all. ;)"
"17669","@Lauradickens1 @cineworld You should come up some time it's a good experience for the big movies.  They've just installed screen X we watched Shazam yesterday <U+0001F602>"
"17670","I was the chief researcher for Shazam in this episode, I hope everyone enjoys this."
"17671","i'm just now realizing that zachary levi (the guy who plays billy's supehero form in shazam [i refuse to call him shazam]) was in my favorite marvel movie and that his talents were completely wasted there"
"17672","@theifunanya_ @theaphrodite__ I have an anti-magic screen... lemme Shazam into your dm to see the magic well"
"17673","@datnofact Well after Endgame my nostalgia and investment for the MCU is gonna wear off, so I’ll probably look for something else. If DC is able to provide stuff to the same level as Shazam I’m definitely down. Excited for Joker!"
"17674","@RegalMovies #RegalChoosesYou @diligentfan Shazam, I promise to keep it away from Batman."
"17675","#Shazam. @ZacharyLevi Amazing as the lead #SHAZAM @ponysmasher Good job....  The film is precise,  simple  &amp; funny.... Kudos to the entire cast of #ShazamMovie @ShazamMovie Watched it finally... Worth it totally"
"17676","This genuinely makes me smile :)) 
So glad #Shazam is doing well"
"17677","Shazam is great, big change up from the tried and true formula of DC making bad movies. Def cheesy but works for the character really well. Just a lot of fun."
"17678","Also a recurring joke in the movie is to crap on Shazam cape, which is dumb cause Shazam cape is among the dopest of all heroes."
"17679","So I think DC learned that if Zac Snyder doesn’t touch any of their films it will be good after watching Shazam lol #Shazam"
"17680","Not fucking with this Shazam movie."
"17681","@COOLGUYMOE567 From what I'm hearing Shazam is currently the best DC movie in the DCEU so I recommend you go see that &amp; plus Hellboy is not out yet &amp; it's a reboot usually you want to wait &amp; hear other people's opinions either from people who actually saw it or reviewers you trust."
"17682","It occurs to me billy never gets an actually superhero name. so maybe there is hope he will be called Captain Thunder since that was his 1st name before hey switched it to captain marvel back in the golden age. #shazam #ShazamMovie"
"17683","im kind of annoyed the movie was not in wider release overseas, it really should be doing serious numbers #Shazam  #ShazamMovie"
"17684","Mr Tawny is in the movie most forget he started as a stuffed animal in one incantation but I feel the shazam family Dad is spiritually him. #ShazamMovie #Shazam"
"17685","I’m putting it out there. #Shazam was ok at best if you’re an adult. I think for kids it’s probably fun. 

Sorry. I don’t see why it’s got such plaudits.

Acting not great, jokes mostly fell flat and it really was quite boring. 

Aquaman and Wonder Woman are much better."
"17686","Really enjoyed #Shazam even aside from the loud mouths in the cinema who didn't understand ""shush""

It has vibes of Spider-Man Homecoming, Kick-Ass and Big. 

It's the second film to do with fostering I've seen this year, the other being Instant Family which I also recommend."
"17687","Going to watch  #ShazamMovie and really excited!! @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel <U+0001F495>"
"17688","I initially misread this as Kazaam and was immensely confused..."
"17689","at city cinema <U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+0001F60E><U+0001F60E><U+0001F60E> — watching Shazam! Movie"
"17690","The only reason why I'm about to watch a superhero movie (Shazam) in a theatre after stating that I won't watch any more superhero movies is that it actually looks FUN and not like another one of those heteronormative grimdark muscle dickfest movies"
"17691","Because Geoff Johns is a god"
"17692","So tons of people hated New 52 (not me) yet the producer for Aquaman and Shazam say those stories translate better to film. I’ve always felt like people were only harsh towards New 52 strictly cause of continuity, not stories."
"17693","@xboxuk create money because my brother wants to be Batman , and who dont want to be Shazam?"
"17694","@Ky_Loe @BenBSinger I think they say they need to do the algorithm a bit and seeing as the two movies just came out people would be looking up Shazam and captain marvel more than thor."
"17695","A big Congrats to @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel and all the rest of cast and crew for @ShazamMovie making it to #1 movie in the world. Us as fans are so honored to help this movie make it &amp; help support the ones we love. Let's keep this movie going strong at #1 we love you guys<U+26A1><U+2764><U+0001F60A>"
"17696","@SuicideSquadcst @Allenfire @ScottDC27 @brentacPrime @TheFliteCast @revrim @jordanfunky HELP! I’ve been digging around to find this answer, but can’t...

Does anyone know the story about the flaming cello in the Rock of Eternity?? #SHAZAM!"
"17697","@BlakeOlivia MoS
Wonder Woman
Shazam
Aquaman

Shazam and Wonder Woman are really close but I just love the war aspect to WW and how seriously it takes that, such a cool experience"
"17698","Moving thread from one of my favorite comics writers on @ShazamMovie, my favorite live-action comic book movie since The Dark Knight, and the yang to its yin"
"17699","@Rheiret Yes, I love it, I am not familiar with the mythology or character but I love that it was explained in a simple way in order for people like me to get it; by the way I now want to read the comics, I want to know more about Shazam."
"17700","Hoping and praying that I'll get to see #Shazam on Wednesday! I'm always late getting to the movies but at least I'm working on seeing more of them this year. <U+0001F602>"
"17701","So Shazam is out?! It's gonna be weird seeing Zachary Levi without him wearing nerd herd t-shirt."
"17702","@MarksReeseWIP No. Can we talk about @ShazamMovie taking place in Philadelphia!?"
"17703","Ghostbusters had a much higher budget than Shazam including marketing. Ghostbusters had to make $300 mil to break even (it didn't), while Shazam probably needs around $200 mil.

Ghostbusters not being able to open in China didn't help it either. Plus hateful fanbois bashing it."
"17704","About to go see @ShazamMovie for the THIRD time lol this time in 3D! Absolutely love love love this movie! @ZacharyLevi kills it and omg @FaitheHerman is my new favorite human being <U+0001F60D><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"17705","Gay?  So shazam is cancelled"
"17706","I wonder how Shazam is going to do in toy sales because I saw a bunch of kids in the theater for Shazam"
"17707","Yo, this movie is awesome!!  I loved every minute of it!  I must go see it again!"
"17708","I heard Shazam was tight but they don't call him Captain Marvel at all..... Can someone just reply with a yes or a no if there's a reason for it at all because that's honestly heart breaking and it's not something I wanted to happen."
"17709","@chrostian123 @AqeelDC ""Shazam!"", than ""Man of Steel""."
"17710","homecoming is literally miles morales rip off.. let’s not do too much"
"17711","@realbocaj They attacked Shazam Jacob, I had to defend myself"
"17712","I’m still waiting on y’all to do this with Homecoming"
"17713","@MattsiMG's new favorite movie is SHAZAM and all you motherheckers will just have to deal with it"
"17714","@CBNostalgia The bold bright colors were one of the things I really liked about Shazam."
"17715","Actually there were a LOT of furry shoutouts in Captain Marv... I mean Shazam!  There were Sobeks too!"
"17716","Shazam is humble and adorable and very modern and an 80s throwback all at once.  And it's FUNNY!  I'm starting to wonder about myself because it's my favorite superhero movie since Black Panther and Wonder Woman!"
"17717","@AdamLanceGarcia I like marvel movies &amp; have read couple of their comics , but I grow up with DC comic &amp; smallville since BVS I have been hearing ppl shiting on DC which made me sad , after Aquaman &amp; Shazam I am hearing more positive things about DC which makes me happy"
"17718","@kevinpowers70 the only thing helping the movie is WOM , but it's fine the budget is low so it can breakeven. Shazam &amp; Aquaman are my favourite DC movies right now , it's sad that this universe didn't start like this"
"17719","As usual, great insight by Gail Simone on Shazam. Both the movie and the comic book. And FOUND FAMILY, my personal catnip."
"17720","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Hahahaha this way of celebrating is very creative! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB>"
"17721","@GalGadot @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie Hahahaha this way of celebrating is very creative! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB> Now I want to see it!!! <U+0001F440>"
"17722","Thread. I cannot wait to see this movie now."
"17723","I love this thread"
"17724","Just got done watching #Shazam. Enjoyed the movie. Didn’t know much about the character so didn’t know what to expect. Good fun."
"17725","@ShazamMovie is number #1 in the world congrats guys @AsherAngel #ShazamMovie"
"17726","I just wanna mention Shazam was pretty adorable and I think you guys are gonna have a great time"
"17727","@Xbox Good thing I found this. My friend almost passed out when he found this out, Shazam(Captain Marvel) being his favorite hero. Thanks for this opportunity @Xbox"
"17728","He said he would want only Accelerated Perception. Not the best but still a pretty cool power"
"17729","Glad The Rock decided to split the Black Adam and Shazam stories into two separate movies.

Smart move"
"17730","Since my own boyfriend saw Shazam without me. I’m going to watch this movie without him. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F><U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"

"17734","@JWilliamJames I’m sorry to hear. Did you at least get to the part where the foster kids became Shazam as well?"
"17735","You all might be psyched over Shazam, but here's an article reminding you why it's important not to forget how Captain Marvel has just outgrossed The Dark Knight."
"17736","@MLairdWilding I’ve heard that pointed out a few times now, billy was kind of dark but Shazam was goofy. My beef with the cameo was that instead of not showing who it was they could have went with an actor that was available. The ending fight scene was a little “power-rangery” for me as well."
"17737","Did anyone see Shazam! on the weekend? 

What were your thoughts? It seems to be getting mostly positive reviews. I still hope to see it soon."
"17738","Listening to ep # 43 of #WakeUpWithJimAndSaab and super agree with @ShazamMovie #ShaSUPERYAY <U+0001F601> Looking forward to its own *deep dive* episode!"
"17739","Watched @ShazamMovie over the weekend.  It was fantastic!  And @ZacharyLevi did a magnificent job.  Everyone needs to see it."
"17740","@TAD_isONLINE_ I'm hoping if Shazam does well, it might end up on the table."
"17741","Seriously, Gail summed up what made me love Shazam so much. I teared up just reading her reactions to it, which took me back to watching it last night. It was a seriously amazing film."
"17742","Replace Shazam with “every mcu film” and you’re right"
"17743","@DrewBenison boy are you bout to debate shazam vs joker lmao your hero card invalid its not even debatable"
"17744","#SHAZAM was designed for the family. Awesome movie by @ponysmasher. @ZacharyLevi and the rest of the cast was made for this!

"17749","Very interesting I'm reading here that Shazam! soared to the top of the worldwide box office this weekend."
"17750","Ghostbusters: Answer The Call had a $144mil PRODUCTION budget alone and made $46 mil on its first weekend; 31%. Shazam had a $98mil production price tag, and made well over 50% of that in returns on its first weekend. Shazam also wasn’t fighting rather ridiculous, bad press."
"17751","Life is good. Watched #Shazam  last night, and liked it. Now I'm working on a logo for something not comics related, but it's very cool. #mondaymotivation"
"17752","@kathwun She would turn water into wine"
"17753","Ten minutes into Shazam and i can already tell this movie is great tbh."
"17754","The @mondaymovieshow is back tomorrow night with a big show that includes reviews of Pet Semetary, Shazam, Missing Link, Wonder Park, Aquaman, My Hero Academia and so much more"

"17759","I honestly love that Shazam and BvS exist in the same universe. <U+0001F602> It gives me life."
"17760","I don't see why you would make this comparison. 

#Shazam's budget was smaller than Ghostbusters, which is why the film's success is being celebrated. It also exceeded some shaky expectations, given the DCEU's track record, in the past."
"17761","@gtconway3d Lordy George you literally took the thought right out of my head. Shazam <U+0001F92F>mind blown"
"17762","Just watched Shazam a 3rd time dear gawd I absolutely love this movie it gets better each viewing"
"17763","Best part of #Shazam was the end fights scenes and beyond."

"17765","After enjoying Wonder Woman &amp; Aquaman enough to where I'd rewatch them both, which is pretty uncommon for me these days, Shazam being just as good/better will totally end the bad name #DCEU previously held. 
Thank you for moving away from the doom &amp; gloom of the Zack Snyder era!!"

"17770","@SWillWhicker Well reviewed and received but forgettable.
I saw Shazam last night and I enjoyed it, but I am not dying to see it again and don't see myself re-watching every year.
I'm even from Zumbrota, which surprised me to hear that town called out in the movie and why. #releasethesnydercut"

Shazam cost roughly 100 million. 

Ghostbusters made 46 million opening weekend. 
Shazam made 53 million opening weekend. 

Shazam clearly has a much better ROI regarding opening weekend numbers."
"17779","@stevenhuff4 @ShazamMovie That your town/city got a censored version of the movie show proves my point.  The trailer is misleading and unwittingly draws parents in with their kids to only be blindsided with gory/graphic murders.  The trailers have no mention of the ""other half"" of this movie."
"17780","Hey! You know that epic score Captain Marvel vs Shazam had? #DeathBattle musician @bmichaelyates has been releasing all sorts of music lately, including this dope Tokyo Ghoul cover! Check it out, it's rad!

"17782","Took my father-in-law to Shazam last night. It's fun. There's a lot to like: 
- Great diverse casting.
- Levi, Angel and Grazer are stand-outs. Levi in particular looks like he's having a ball. 
- It feels modern and clever.

"17789","my biggest accomplishment in life was being called a walking Shazam, nothing lives up to that, nothing has compared."
"17790","Unpopular opinion here, but I thought #Shazam was great for what it needed to be. Billy Batson is 14yrs, and the movie is primarily tailored toward that demographic. It didn't have to be gritty to be awesome. It's a comedic family superhero film in the vein of '80s family films."
"17791","Just as the funny Deadpool can exist in the same universe as the high-stakes Days of Future Past, I think #Shazam fits in as what it needs to be. If you expect Man of Steel here you'll be disappointed. Also, Darla steals every scene she's in. It's cool."

"17821","Oh yeah guys, Shazam was pretty good. Almost great, maybe I'll eventually come around to great, but for now pretty good. For sure the best of the modern DC films."
"17822","It does exist. What are you talking about?!"
"17823","@Boogie2988 After that can I hear a spoiler review for Shazam? Saw it last night, and I have a lot of weird opinions. I argue that it's the darkest DC movie since The Watchmen. And at the same time felt very similar to Richard Donner's original Superman movie."
"17824","@TheCollector198 Loved Aquaman and Shazam but Wonder Woman is farrrr superior to both. And for me the best superhero origin movie next to Man of Steel."
"17825","@BlessingFitka Which did you see? Hope its not shazam?"
"17826","didn’t get great avengers endgame imax tickets so I booked Shazam showing in the same seat to preview the vantage point."

"17837","@NonchalantRod Ima keep it real it’s funny but the fighting scenes are trash (there’s only like 2). They got Shazam looking weak as hell in that movie."

"17905","I’m very late to the party on this one, but #Shazam is a blast. So much heart dripping from that film. Certainly isn’t perfect, I think it has some obvious tonal issues.

"17930","After seeing the positive reviews for Shazam, I'm even more excited to see it."
"17931","@RegalMovies #RegalChoosesYou to use the eight ball to tell me how great #Shazam is @DVegaCounseling"
"17932","""Shazam!"" Lightning strikes and a cloud of smoke appears and when it dissipates i'm lying completely dead on the pavement."
"17933","Shazam! should have been a centerpiece release for DC Films and they treated it like an afterthought which is disheartening."
"17934","I was so excited to see @ShazamMovie and it lived up to my expectations and more. @ZacharyLevi is 100% meant to be in this role and I couldn’t imagine it being anyone else. Go see it! You won’t be sorry! <U+0001F4AA><U+0001F3FB><U+26A1><U+FE0F> #CaptainSparklefingers #DCComics"
"17935","You're so sweet and charming, and such a cool person. Things got kinda weird yesterday, you know what I mean<U+0001F602> but I'm glad you were so cool about it. One of the finest people I've come across here. For your sake I was really hoping the post credit scene in Shazam showed more <U+0001F602>"
"17936","@staryabos Love mcu spidey (sry) i havent seen Shazam but rly?? Can the DC/Marvel banter stop already?? AND we all know mcuPeter stole some stuff from miles so can they get lives and just tweet abt what they love and stop picking on Shazam!!"
"17937","@PeterMcGuireIE Shazam surprisingly good in that mould..."
"17938","Going to try and see Shazam tomorrow.."
"17939","@OnePerfectShot Honestly the next few months have so many big movies coming out, opening weekends don't mean as much when people are having to pick between Shazam and Pet Semetary or Endgame and Detective Pikachu. Our wallets can only handle so much"
"17940","so someone find me more mutuals that’s seen and  likes Shazam so I can talk to them about it<U+0001F927><U+0001F97A>"
"17941","I’ve been saying “hands. Lightning with my hands. Lightning with my hands. Lightning with my haaaaaaannnddsss.” Like @ZacharyLevi in #Shazam all day. It’s a catchy tune guys."
"17942","@evomek @HiTopFilms They have different characterizations. Superman has never acted like Shazam and vice versa."

"17946","I doubt he’s anymore problematic than the person your @ is about, but okay?"
"17947","shazam a rip off of hc? I have to laugh hc wish"
"17948","So I went to see @ShazamMovie #Shazam over the weekend.  Loved it! In a world full of adult humor, nudity &amp; dark themes its was refreshing to see a movie that was full of fun, family &amp; light humor.  DC got it right this time!"
"17949","Just saw #Shazam to each their own but I loved it!! And Well Zachary Levi I JUST LOVE You!! <U+0001F629><U+0001F927>

Not gonna spoiled anything but Adam Brody made me teared up a little don’t know why but I thought that Seth Cohen would literally be fangirling rn!! <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"17950","@ponysmasher Here's my theory about the city bus in Shazam: ""4th &amp; Walnut"" is a Thomas Merton reference. Am I right?"
"17951","Love Shazam but this film is really underperforming. We can thank WB marketing department for that."
"17952","A word to people like campea who is saying #Shazam box office is low you absolute weazel"
"17953","i would take 12 bullets for each of these people"
"17954","Yes. ‘Shazam!’ was more enjoyable than ‘Captain Marvel’. (The doesnt mean you can talk to me now, Review Bombers... I’m not one of you... lol)"
"17955","@The_TemaraMelek @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel Omg!! I need to go see it now!! Can’t wait!"
"17956","@AshleyVRobinson The ability to understand why we needed #Shazam ....love that movie."
"17957","I really liked this movie, but like most origin films it only really hits its stride in the third act. That last 45 minutes is what I wanted the whole movie to be. It also fully embraces comic book lore and goofiness. Zachary Levi is amazing."
"17958","I think it's allowed to not enjoy non Snyder DCEU films. Personally I wasn't over the moon with Aquaman and Shazam but I think attacking people that didn't enjoy them is very uncalled for. I'd like to think we're better than that."
"17959","@ColeWunmi never read shazam in new 52. i'll just check later."
"17960","the SHAZAM origins special is such a nice read. no surprise there though, i don't think i've ever read a SHAZAM comic that disappointed me."
"17961","@ShazamMovie I love it 
@AsherAngel @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie"
"17962","@keileykaiser and of course our lord Mark for Shazam that would be great-"
"17963","We went to see #Shazam! over the weekend. It wasn't perfect, but it was a lot of fun! (Which is more than you can say for most DC movies these days?)"
"17964","This review makes me so happy. The Big Red Cheese has always been one of my favorite characters, and the trailers had me worried."
"17965","there’s no reason for the foster dad in Shazam to be as hot as he is"
"17966","I think #Shazam is a win for DC and a great follow up to Aquaman in their transition out of the doom-and-gloom era. Some definite technical hiccups and a little cookie-cutter at points, but fun overall and pretty grounded/small scale"
"17967","I'm proud of you DC 

#Shazam is everything I thought it would be"
"17968","@ScottMendelson Just read your article on Shazam.  Some of my friends who don't understand bowling terms thought you were calling Shazam, Wondering Woman, and Aquaman box office turkeys. lol.<U+0001F602>"
"17969","Saw #Shazam <U+26A1><U+FE0F>today with the fam. Not had such all-round family flicks fun since the Jumanji reboot. <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F> reminded me also of #Chuck which was one of our very first box sets. Nice moves @ZacharyLevi"
"17970","Now I'm retweeting Ben retweeting my tweet to say he's a cool dude. Genuinely one of the nicest guys I've worked with."
"17971","anyway I loved the film and I would genuinely die for the shazam family. it’s not perfect but definitely one of my fav cbms"
"17972","@ZacharyLevi I just saw shazam today, it was absolutely amazing! you were wonderful <U+0001F60A> and thank you @ponysmasher for this beautiful and uplifting film I absolutely loved it <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"17973","okay but shazam having a whole scene where they played don’t stop me now by queen in its entirety, I was having the best fucking time"
"17974","Such a great movie!!!! <U+2764><U+2764> it was very funny"
"17975","@ZacharyLevi I don’t know your politics or whether you know of or like @benshapiro, but he recommended #Shazam! on his podcast today and called you “a real movie star, just terrific.” Said the movie is delightful and that people should go see it. <U+0001F642>"
"17976","It's only Monday but so much happened today. The best thing? SHAZAM! <U+2665>"
"17977","#Shazam is a fantastic, joyous film. I can't recommend it enough. What's even cooler is it was written by fellow UT alum @HenryGayden. Be sure to see this movie if you've haven't already! #HookEm #WhatStartsHereChangesTheWorld"
"17978","@The_TemaraMelek @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @The_TemaraMelek @ZacharyLevi I can’t wait to see this  movie!!!! SHAZAM!<U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"17979","Now that takeover is in the past HOF passed and Shazam and wrestlemania are in the rear view window now it’s time to look forward to one last thing 
ENDGAME April 26th"
"17980","There are multiple references to the director's previous film Lights Out, including a recasting of minor British comedian Andi Osho as literally the same character. Somehow, Shazam is the superior horror film"
"17981","DC got it right with Shazam, movie was hilarious. Would recommend 100%"
"17982","Just saw @ShazamMovie and it was perfect! Thank you @ZacharyLevi and the rest of #warnerbrothers for bringing the original Captain Marvel to life! (P.S. Darla is absolutely the best good sister) <U+0001F917>"
"17983","shazam is definitely DCEU best so far. the diversity, ah! so well placed humor with a mix of heart and zachary levi, hats off, man!"
"17984","kids are violent monsters the movie is actually perfect for kids."
"17985","Shazam! debuted with $53.51M this weekend.  Total gross stands at $56.83M.

"17986","One of my favorite comics chat shows has a nice review of Secret Voice vol 1 around the 1:58 mark. Includes the phrase “Michel Fiffe’s BONE” which, hey—I’ll take it! <U+0001F602>"
"17987","#Shazam lives up to the hype.   Go see it.    One of the best super hero movies made to date.    I rarely laugh out loud in a movie but at least 4 times I couldn’t stop myself.   #family"
"17988","Regarding the two films I saw over the weekend, #PetSemetary just didn’t work, unfortunately. Not terrible, just...lifeless. #Shazam on the other hand was an absolutely charming blast."
"17989","@pedroangelnsc @MrProduction8 @dcumoviepage Shazam is the best Superman movie and it only has 3 seconds of him. Even though it doesn't even have a whole of Superman :P"
"17990","Because Shazam made more and cost significantly less while Ghostbusters cost significantly more and made less
That’s why lmfao and Shazam’s domestic is greater than what I assume is ghostbuster’s total?"
"17991","What a waist of time @ShazamMovie @DCComics"
"17992","Saw Shazam over the weekend and kind of loved it. It was super fun, good humor, great action, and an origin story that didn't feel tired. It did enough right to overlook the stuff that was bad/wrong."
"17993","Damn. If Shazam couldn’t make 100 mill in one weekend, that Hellboy thing will make even less."
"17994","Interesting Hollywood q: will Shazam and the rise of the midbudget superhero movie ensure the longevity of the category or hasten its demise?"
"17995","@tomhoIlond @staryabos there’s been a misunderstanding here bc i don’t think that’s what starry is saying

the shazam thing is new and of course most hoco stans would never say that

but a lot of people follow that dumbass and others in that circle 

i love mcu spidey but he’s not immune to criticism"
"17996","Well, #SHAZAM is absolutely one of the most fun superheroes I've ever seen brought to life. Hopefully this will get a sequel."
"17997","Cancelling a kid because he smoked weed? Wow..."
"17998","@Complex It’s not meant for kids whatsoever. If you were a platform who actually talks about movies, tv, etc instead of music then maybe you’d educate yourself to know these things. Shazam is a comic character who yes is a kid, but most of the time an adult. With adult storylines."
"17999","My theater gasped when Superman appeared at the end of Shazam, no one asked whether it was cavill or not, that symbol means so much more than just some actor's face"
"18000","“Is this 15 year old still problematic?” %}^{*€|€;&amp;@;$;^?.?.¥£|€"
"18001","Not an original observation by any stretch, but still kinda weird that Shazam, superhero formerly known as Captain Marvel, has a movie out just about a month after the Captain Marvel movie. *shrug*"
"18002","@Hot_Kicks @somespecialguy @TMZ See #Shazam in theatres"
"18003","@Haydenfilms @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RanesHook @neildmonte @ImTheAllience @B_McStunna @Evollweiler1 @AYFFOfficial It covers familiar territory if you are a comic fan, but it is so well done, and so funny in parts, that nobody minds."
"18004","@AmazonChique Ghostbusters also opened in July with a budget of 146 million, while Shazam opened in April under a 100 million budget. Not really a fair comparison, although I get what you are trying to get across."
"18005","SHAZAM! was awesome!

Like DEADPOOL, it balanced humor and drama without tipping too far in either direction. Just a purely enjoyable film that wanted to entertain the audience, not lecture them (almost like an 80s throwback in that respect!) 

DC is kicking ass. Loved it! <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"18006","This was @dest_jayy when we went to go watch Shazam <U+0001F602>"
"18007","Lmao oh cut the bullshit, who wrote this headline??? A lot of violence? I saw families go see Deadpool"
"18008","one thing i forgot to give props to shazam for was having actual jokes instead of just people being unlikable and sarcastic towards each other"
"18009","@UberKryptonian I fully expect a scene from shazam/superman first thunder where Billy has a friend die in front of him. Maybe not one of the family members but a close friend or one of the foster parents"
"18010","@Josh2Gud4U Idk if you saw the imax preview in front of shazam but this movie looks insane.
My wife turned to me and was like why does it have to be so extra"
"18011","@GeekBomb @maudegarrett I found Shazam to be a lot more fun with better references to the larger universe. CM relied on Fury a little too much."
"18012","I really didn’t know about this movie till now!!!<U+0001F923><U+0001F923>"
"18013","“Why did Shazam open so low?” 

Lol. Yeah...50 million for a relatively unheard of superhero made 50 MILLION dollars. On an 80 million dollar budget. 

Not every superhero movie is going to make Endgame money. Nor does it need to."
"18014","What? Zachary Levi is Shazam! come on man puberty hits yow hahahhaha #Shazam"
"18015","Originally wasn’t planning on seeing Shazam but I’m actually pretty excited to see it tomorrow night with all the positive feedback I’ve been seeing."
"18016","@jenashu Shazam and captain marvel in the grove Saturday?"
"18017","@Fcsnva @Haydenfilms @DCComics @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @neildmonte @ImTheAllience @B_McStunna @Evollweiler1 @AYFFOfficial Why does it sort of remind me of Penny Marshall's ""Big"", but with a superhero instead of prematurely grown Tom Hanks?"
"18018","If I have to choose just one DC movie, animated or live action... I choose The Death of Superman.  It was near perfection to me.  9.5/10"
"18019","that's probably my sister too at first.  She doesn't seem interested in the movie, but I tell her she needs to see it and she will love it;  she spent part of her childhood in a foster home.. we were orphans too young, but I was older.  #shazam"
"18020","People saying #Shazam is the first good #DCEU movie, must not have seen #aquaman"
"18021","@UpToTASK Shazam is a movie about a superhero, so it’s obviously paying homage to Zack Snyder."
"18022","What the..."
"18023","If I could do this I wouldn’t have to worry no more"
"18024","so when billy batson shouts shazam he turns into a superhero but when i shout shazam i’m “annoying” and “need to go do my homework”"
"18025","I want @_joshpray doing our reviews! This is the sweetest, funniest, most perfect @ShazamMovie review yet!"
"18026","Shazam is such a good movie I went to see it twice <U+0001F602>"
"18027","me, daydreaming about getting shazam powers and my best self being a fully transitioned man: *lays in a pool of tears*"
"18028","I let Man of Steel slide because I have a soft spot for Henry. 

So Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam are the only DC movies."
"18029","I got what I expected. Forgettable, popcorn movie."
"18030","I'm gonna say this ONCE! do NOT ship any of the kids in shazam! THEY ARE SIBLINGS!!! idc if their adopted.  family is family. stop being weird and stay away from my children you freaks"
"18031","Literally said the same thing. I was like Shazam? This shit already came out years ago <U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF>"
"18032","@GeekBomb Shazam. Honored everything that came before it on a ground level, and set up larger universe threats."
"18033","This thread! If anyone asked me why I loved SHAZAM! so much I probably couldn’t fully explain it. But Gail here just put it down perfectly."
"18034","Perhaps the narrative that Warner Bros/DC are completely clueless needs to die. Excited to see Shazam."
"18035","@datkobrand @ZeeWorden I'm Team Philadelphia before I'm Team anything else. And I agree. Shazam hits right in the Philly Pheels"
"18036","@blaksheepno1 @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @ponysmasher Thank you-even she keeps wondering how she did it! Lol"
"18037","@TheKayusBobo Press and hold Shazam button to activate auto Shazam"
"18038","Already watched the movie and i didn't have any idea that you will appear @RossButler #shazam"
"18039","Saw Shazam! tonight, by the end of the 1st end credit scene everyone had left (even my mum) &amp; I was sat patiently waiting for the 2nd end credit scene with the cinema staff tidying up for the next movie around me! #worthit #endcredits #shazam<U+26A1> @ZacharyLevi"
"18040","Just giving another quick reminder that my #Shazam easter eggs post goes up at 6:00pm (Pacific) and 9:00pm (Eastern)."
"18041","@GeekBomb It’s hard to decide. Even if they are both superhero movies, they are so different. Captain Marvel was more of an Action movie with a pinch of humour. And Shazam had more of a comedy action movie feel to it. It’s a tie for me."
"18042","I’m going to see Shazam tonight cause my mental health is very shitty today <U+0001F643> I hope it’s a funny movie"
"18043","Shazam was great but my theater was almost completely empty"
"18044","Movie was fun, talking about it was fun too. Check out the review. Careful of Spoilers <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F37F>"
"18045","@x_bloodline_x I never seen Wonder Woman &amp; Aquaman yet i feel so disappointed by myself jsksjsk !! I know Aquaman has amazing critics so i’m really exited to watch it ! BUT RN there Shazam at the theater Omfg i need to go watch it <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"18046","really really really hope that I will feel at least relatively okay tomorrow so I can go see Shazam again bc with the week I'm about to have I NEED that"
"18047","does anyone have an HD pic of the scene where billy jumps off the roof and shouts shazam? pls it’s for science"
"18048","@GeekBomb @maudegarrett Loved 'em both. This is hard... I might edge Shazam because I liked the third act better."
"18049","@noyal_jacob @Luiz_Fernando_J If it weren't for ""Us"" &amp; #Shazam, it could have, but I think people are more wanting to see her, but mostly the other Avengers in #Endgame than they are in seeing her again in her own movie."
"18050","@bmurphy28 Fair enough about the kids seeing it but that's the risk you take when you take them out in a non controlled environment. Went to see Shazam last night where there was a gruesome scene to kids and kids started crying"
"18051","Tiny thread post seeing #shazam (spoilers probably, so go ahead and avoid if you care)"
"18052","4. Stay through the two credits scenes, one is serious and contains plot, the other is for a laugh. Also the animated Shazam v. The Justice League credit sequence is fun to watch anyway."
"18053","@kaifhossainhash Had they done that, Shazam doesn't even make what it did this past weekend from what I see. WB/DC is playing this very smart, and they have the reach to do so on the heels of Aquaman's smashing success."
"18054","Get super baked and go see #Shazam u won’t regret it."
"18055","Shazam is so good both Red Letter Media and YourMovieSucks liked it"
"18056","@Ajepart1 @UpToTASK Cuz this is it Zack made Shazam. He made Man of Steel pretty grey"
"18057","I'll believe it when I see it at this point. #BlackAdam"
"18058","I loved @ShazamMovie 

Even more than Wonder Woman, actually"
"18059","Going to see Shazam on Wednesday to see that five mins of Godzilla footage. Will be first superhero I’ve seen since Logan"
"18060","Sad to see @HellboyMovie pushing @IMAX hard and there isn't a single IMAX screening w/in 40 miles of me b/c they all are showing Shazam still."
"18061","Shazam also only cost 80 million, whereas Ghostbusters cost 144, and they did extensive amounts of marketing for a summer release for Ghostbusters, whereas Shazam just kind of came out in April."
"18062","@GailSimone @ZacharyLevi Mostly I worry about how wasted these characters feel - part of the pantheon that goes into the SHAZAM acronym (hexagrammaton?...) is shared with Diana of Themiscyra, but that's rarely if ever been made relevant; an orphan named BatSon was never taken by Bruce Wayne as a Robin."
"18063","@GailSimone @ZacharyLevi Even the more CM-specific antagonists feel like untapped potential. King Kull in Convergence: Shazam was presented as technologically brilliant while verbally challenged, an acknowledgement of very different kinds of intelligence rarely handled in that combination."
"18064","@GailSimone @ZacharyLevi In DC's history I see very few people who seem to have a tangible love for these characters: @thealexrossart (Justice is better than Kingdom Come), @DocShaner and @jeffparker (Convergence: Shazam was a breath of fresh air).
You seem to be on a similar page. I hope you get a shot."
"18065","@GailSimone @ZacharyLevi I personally favour the version of CM where young Batson got the powers due to being the one pure soul even in a harsh complicated world, something the animated ""Superman/Shazam: Return of Black Adam"" depicted very well - requires good writing to do justice to."
"18066","My neighbors play their music so loud that when I like a song I’m able to Shazam it through the wall.. I mean thanks for lookin out <U+0001F64B><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"18067","Dear people who liked ""Shazam"": Did we watch the same movie? I actually had quite a positive bias towards it, but it was inexcusably so very dull and empty."
"18068","Went to watch Shazam today! Movie was okay, semt to want to make fun of some superhero tropes but it fell to many more bad ones itself which hurts it a lot, and the last half dragged on too much. But the comedy at some points had me rly good, I enjoyed it in the end!"
"18069","@GennHutchison Shazam made me think of early 80s movies that had kind of the same thing going, like Gremlins or Temple of Doom."
"18070","The whole idea is not to him serious"
"18071","@fincherism They said the same about WW and now even Shazam. Just nay sayers and keyboard warriors who will be quickly forgotten."
"18072","@WayTooWitty Not even sure he's the best fit because he likes to be the center of attention. if it were up to him black Adam would have come before Shazam. They should avoid another potential situation with an actor threatening to walk away if he doesn't get his way"
"18073","Shazam abi Shazams is or are the most pointless super hero or heroes <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923>

"18078","Wow. @ponysmasher as someone who has followed your career thus far, it is refreshing and inspiring to see your passion and care reflect in the stories you've directed. Shazam! was a true delight, and I know I speak for many when I say I can't wait to see what you make next."
"18079","@AqeelDC Man of Steel! Everything from the story to the soundtrack is top notch. The one that comes close to beating it would be Wonder Woman. Haven't seen Shazam just yet."

Go watch this movie!

"18095","@saintwalker98 But some of the comparisons don't make sense like comparing it to Captain Marvel which is more of a self identity and space adventure movie while Shazam is about family and learning not to be a prick"
"18096","I wish people could review Shazam! Without comparing it to another superhero movie, stop comparing it to Captain Marvel, Deadpool, Thor"
"18097","she reminded me of the little girl from Shazam <U+0001F62D><U+0001F602><U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"18098","Just watched Shazam yesterday and man that was a such an amazing movie tbh, so many great scenes and themes... If I could compare it to something, it really reminded me of the more lighthearted Superman movies."
"18099","Not to stan white  men but I really want to see Shazam it just looks.........fun"
"18100","Side effect of #SHAZAM being a surprisingly big bit and resonating with critics: there's now a real chance of BLACK ADAM actually happening instead of just being a nebulous The Rock Project that never actually materializes."
"18101","THE iconic scene from #ShazamMovie <U+26A1>, which is GREAT!"
"18102","I was thinking about why it was that I loved watching things like “Shazam” and “It” and I honestly think it’s mostly because I’m seeing kids my age actually playing,, kids,,, my age. Instead of seeing adults who already matured pretending to be kids going through puberty (part 1)"
"18103","Love this thread about Shazam, why the its characters are so unique and special, and why all of this works so well in the movie."
"18104","@NerrdPack @TheNerdCouncil_ Work is defo still needed. But so far the films that aren’t too tied to the dceu do the best; Man of Steel (technically before the DCEU began), Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam. DC just need to stop forcing it."
"18105","@SlyGamer64B Idk, Shazam looked good, but I'm not sinking money into a universe that isn't trying. At least with the MCU I'm getting a great movie 99% of the time, with DC it's always been a crapshoot since Dark Knight. Hell even before then you could say."

"18113","*SPOILER*

I enjoyed Shazam overall despite being a bit surprised by the ending and a few flat jokes. Also the body double of Superman at the end was a letdown. Why couldn't they get the real deal? Still very good film and I hope there's a sequel! #Shazam"

I've been so happy since I watched it, I can't stop smiling."

"18123","I still can't get over the VFX of #Shazam, it was so good, so good. Makes me look at Man of Steel &amp; BVS, it had no reason to be that expensive. It's crazy, WB/DC gave ZS WAY TOO much money for those movies and they did just okay but, not successful like WW or AQM &amp; hopefully SHZ"
"18124","@margellehatake For the sake of it being Shazam. Yes"
"18125","@NkCaliber Never been a fan of Shazam as a hero, is it really worth seeing?"
"18126","As a primary TPB reader I caved and bought the single issues of Shazam by @geoffjohns after seeing the film! If you're a fan of the #Shazam movie you should pick these up asap they tie together beautifully."
"18127","Loved @ShazamMovie !!! It couldn't have been better than @ZacharyLevi to play to boy in adult role. 
Chuck all over again!!"
"18128","i saw shazam with nick last night and lemme just say: i love zachary levi and i love that he hasn’t changed since chuck... i love he"
"18129","So #Shazam was adorable. Very New 52 and perfectly casted. Left with a reluctant smile"
"18130","I swear people just want picturesque cinematography in everything, even if it doesn't work or straight up portray what a film is going for.

If Shazam looked pretty, it wouldn't have worked."
"18131","Shazam was so good. Have I mentioned how much I adore @ZacharyLevi ??"
"18132","Im getting back on my movie reviews. It's been a good minute since I've done one and Ive seen a ton of great and shitty movies since. And let me tell you, SHAZAM! is GREAT! Such a funny, clever, and emotional movie. It is absolutely my favorite live action DC movie since TDK!"
"18133","@Ekene____ @electraguunn Bro, Na the same thing. Both of them are to blame. Do you know if the girl that went to the movies with her boyfriend also slept over?? Or my guy was also quick to drop her off and meet up with that cinema deal. 

Did he ever bring it up to his babe to go see shazam?"
"18134","@TheCollector198 Despite the compromised third act, Wonder Woman is a better directed, better written, is better shot and has better music than Aquaman and SHAZAM! . 
Bonus, it also has Chris Pine as Steve Trevor."
"18135","anyways funniest part of the shazam press tour is the fact that jack dylan grazer had his phone taken away by his parents and zac wouldnt stop laughing"
"18136",".@ShazamMovie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I really love it!!! The actors are great, and the comedic timing is perfect as well as the script. Kudos to everyone involved in this movie! #Shazam"
"18137","@jojotheoddity Earlier chapters had the shazam storyline at the end. That's when he started getting called and got a new suit. 
It was hard to read, but I'm pretty sure that's what they based to movie off of. The actual justice league story was one of the few good new 52 stories"
"18138","Went to see #Shazam today. Decent superhero movie, some funny lines here and there with a serviceable villain. One of the better DC films but that's not really saying much. I'd say it's nowhere near Wonderwoman but better than Aquaman. I'd give it a 4.5/10 #DC #ZacharyLevi"
"18139","@ZacharyLevi ugly crying right now. #Adopt #Foster it's not just for animals. #Home #Family #Shazam"
"18140","Someone give me money to go see Shazam again as reparations for international romani day"
"18141","@NerdyBatman @DCComics @ThatKevinSmith David F. Sandberg is amazing and perfect for Shazam however I would love Smith to do a Plastic Man movie, it would rule so hard"
"18142","Hello, citizens of Twitter. As of today, you must refer to the family of DC's Captain Marvel as the ""Shazamily"". Any other names are illegitimate. That is all."
"18143","@TegaOkagbare I thought I liked it until I deeped. They should have given Disney or Nickelodeon that movie for free! Shazam my ass. Zero plot. L for effort."

"18146","@TheLastGlow have you seen Shazam, there’s a line in it by Mark Strong “Play times over boy” as he’s drowning Billy, sound familiar <U+0001F609>"
"18147","@TheLastGlow I like Shazam it’s like Big but with a superhero, Capt Marvel is pretty cool, but Shonuff is still the baddest Mofo <U+0001F609>"
"18148","SHAZAM! (2019) is part Big, Superman, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Monster’s Inc. all in one"
"18149","Heard a song the other day that I hadn’t heard since childhood, couldn’t remember what it was called so I whipped out Shazam, turns out it was Paris Hilton, legit forgot she ever had a ‘singing’ career"
"18150","#SHAZAM was a very fun movie. So much that I didn’t even assess it while watching, I just enjoyed it the movie experience. I don’t even have a number rating for it. Easily the best film in the DCEU. If you wanna have fun watching a superhero movie, I highly recommend it."
"18151","@dr_khalidz You fly in the night, and then become Malaria man - Using the power of mosquitoes to fight the bad guys, just like Shazam!!!

Still, not trying to take anything away from Shazam, I think it's DCs best film since Nolan's Batman trilogy."
"18161","so my friend watched #shazam and um she was coming up to me the whole day yelling ""SHAZAM POOF"" and honestly I lost my shit"

"18167","Uhhh hell-LO, barista: 

I came here for overpriced coffee and terrible service...not Shazam spoilers."
"18168","""Beautiful"" and perfectly symmetrical shots do not equate to good cinematography. Certain films don't need it, as it could represent a conflict/disconnection to the story being told."
"18169","I talked to David Sandberg about a particularly ingenious cameo in #Shazam."
"18170","@snypershy @BenBSinger Because Shazam was originally named Captain Marvel but Marvel had the rights to that name so DC changed it to Shazam"
"18171","@ponysmasher For what it’s worth, we‘d have a lot better sense of humour about the whole “Martha“ thing if JL hadn’t been taken away from Snyder and the fans of BvS. It’s like rubbing salt in the wounds after JL was butchered by reshoots to please the people who crapped on BvS."

This is spot on, I couldn't have said it better than @GailSimone did, so go watch it!"

"18208","Just got home from seeing #ShazamMovie.  In a word, disappointing.  It had some good moments, but they were quite sparse.  A lot of the ""funny"" was right on that line between humor and stupid, not as bad as a Will Ferrel movie, but can't hold a candle to Marvel."

Shazam provides radio stations and program directors with metrics on what songs people listen to. Shazams are taken into consideration when deciding what songs will be played on a station.

The kid who was like shazams wingman was pretty funny as well, minor complaints really, good DC movie for sure."
"18243","Shazam sucked. Sucked big time. Antagonists were stupid. I'd think Mark Strong would have been embarrassed to be in this movie. How does wrath give the power of flight?  You'd think they would have given the sins some individuality rather than generic gargoyles. Save your money."

"18279","So this weekend I saw both Pet Sematary and Shazam. In terms of genre, tone, and quality they differ widely, but they both had first trailers that are, in very different ways, absolute models of the form, and subsequent trailers that are all the more disappointing as a result. 1/"
"18280","In this respect, the second trailer for Shazam isn't *bad* - not nearly as bad as the second and third Pet Sematary trailers. It doesn't add a whole lot more from later in the movie. But it also doesn't add anything to the sell. The first trailer is complete in that respect. 12/"

"18296","SHAZAM! is the most pleasantly surprised I’ve been at a movie in a long time. I was expecting to enjoy it and have fun. I was not expecting it to handle as many themes as it did, nor do it so deftly. It is absolutely incredible. I’m seriously blown away rn."

"18350","No no no @DCComics #ShazamMovie was not it. Overly animated, forced comedy and too long and drawn out. Fight scenes was poorly done as well, the few that y’all had. This would be a good lifetime movie for kids tho! Stick to the nitty gritty #DCUNIVERSE please."
"18351","I just watched a video on YT called ""Why the actor playing Shazam looks so familiar"" and I'm honestly offended people are acting like @ZacharyLevi hasn't ever acted before? Less Than Perfect? Chuck? TANGLED?! He was in the last 2 Thor movies.... NERD HQ?! RING ANY BELLS?!"

"18418","So just watch #Shazam and wow what an amazing movie @ShazamMovie <U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"18419","have to say #ShazamMovie did not disappoint, was really good"
"18420","@GraceRandolph just seen Shazam! It was very good! That ending though, didn't see that coming. <U+0001F44C>"
"18421","@PlagueOfGripes @KevinDahmer @DEATHBATTLE The fact Shazam is virtually invincible would be he would win most fights."
"18422","Eveyone is seeing Shazam except me this is unfair"
"18423","#Shazam Spoilers:........
Some great performances from the young cast, a great setup that means  children from diverse backgrounds get to see themselves represented on screen, working together and being heroes. A shame the producers didn’t feel the need to extend that experience"
"18424","50+ years later, that is still largely the case is ridiculous. Shazam could have been a game - changer, instead it just leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Very disappointed and really fed up!"
"18425","@TCube_Manning It’s a matter of preference. Shazam had more for me to appreciate. Wonder Woman is still a very competent movie"
"18426","There was Dinosaurs in Aquaman. 
Stop spoiling Shazam."

"18428","Just so you know the @ShazamMovie is amazing"
"18429","I'm not sure why AMC gave Pet Semetary the Dolby theaters last weekend. Seemed fairly obvious Shazam would be the bigger draw."
"18430","Shazam proves that a Booster Gold movie could fuckin work and I’m gonna need DC to step on it"
"18431","Shazam. Lovely movie. Humour really good, cast overall fantastic, awesome 3rd act but not quite what as good as the hype suggests. Slow beginning but really good themes about this movie. 8/10. Top 2/3 DCEU films"
"18432","Shazam!!! Lovely movie! Worth every dime"
"18433","It would be awesome if Superman and Shazam clicked up in the sequel to fight Black Adam."
"18434","I’d want my best friend @TabidicusRules  to have teleportation, so he could visit me lol #ShazamXbox"
"18435","If you see the #DCEU ranking of someone where Aquaman, Shazam, Wonder Woman are on top, then Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad are on bottom, it means that this person hate the #DCEU and Zack Snyder"
"18436","to me shazam was more exciting tbh. should i go watch this again on endgame release day and say FUCK MARVEL <U+0001F60C>"
"18437","Torn between wanting to see SHAZAM!, and wanting to never, ever set foot in a movie theater again."
"18438","just watched shazam and it was way more fun than i expected?"
"18439","Just saw #Shazam and I would happily rewatch it 346575368657575.5 more times."
"18440","Also I wasnt particularly onboard with the direction of the movie going into act 3. Billy Batson's evolution didn't transcend to the  Shazam character, &amp; wasnt convincing enough.Avoiding  spoilery, I'll just say act 3 got silly, not serious enough,kinda ruined it for me!"
"18441","I also believe Endgame consumed the movie tickets, &amp; all the buzz of the opening week of Shazam,in exchange for the enthusiasm of Endgame.Nobody was talking about Shazam last week,but Avenger Endgame tickets on sale&amp; crashing the movies sites&amp; internet! That spoke in volumes!"
"18442","@reggiegotlag Also, I want to point out, look at the number of people who registered a ""review"" for Captain Marvel compared for Shazam."
"18443","and thats where youre wrong <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"

"18445","Best superhero movie of the year right here guys"
"18446","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Not just awful for a SH movie. Just plain bad"
"18447","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Hollywood is more and more reliant on the second biggest movie market. Yes it’s done fine and will make a nice little profit, but the combination on a super competitive month and a disappointing China opening are worrisome in regard to its legs."
"18448","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel As long as it doesn’t make Alita money it should be okay."
"18449","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Dr strange and Shazam are good comparisons though. DS opened in China with 45m compared to Shazam’s 30. The big difference is the competition. DS had plenty of time to make 100m. Shazam has no time at all relatively. It might just make it to 50m before the big one comes."
"18450","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Oh I do. I just hate BVS, and even Suicide Squad. God just the thought of that last movie makes me angry <U+0001F602>"
"18451","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Ah I see. I have 3 sets of tickets booked for that weekend. Biggest worldwide open record is about to be destroyed."
"18452","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Oh it’s going to have the biggest 2nd week drop of all time no doubt. But by the end of the 2nd week it will already be the 11-13 th most successful film ever."
"18453","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel I guess what I’m trying to say is, yes domestically it’s opening was fine, but there’s no way WB didn’t look at those international openings and wonder where it’s box office legs are coming from."
"18454","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Other studios should be scared of opening anywhere near Marvel movies. There’s no shame in that."
"18455","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Each to their own. But I never walk out a movie, but honestly considered it. Give me Shazam any time. It’s really really dumb, but good fun."
"18456","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel The Dark Knight returns is one of the most seminal comic book mini series ever. The abomination we were given. Good greif. I grew up imagining that movie. Incredibly disappointed in it"
"18457","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel BVS was awful though."
"18458","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Just out of interest, why are you waiting 3-4 months to see Endgame?"
"18459","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Domestically Shazam’s drop should be fine. Internationally it won’t be unfortunately."
"18460","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel But definitely not for everyone, hence the disappointing atmosphere in my screening<U+0001F615>"
"18461","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Well we kind of do. It’s looking at a 800m -900m opening weekend worldwide. About 100-150m during its first week. Let’s call it a 50% drop on its first weekend. That puts it in the top 10 worldwide in just a little over 2 weeks."
"18462","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Are you joking that 110m in China for Dr strange is a low number?"
"18463","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel I really liked Shazam, maybe my favourite DC movie apart from MOS. But I could tell from the atmosphere and audience reaction in my theatre that it wasn’t going to be for everyone"
"18464","@annericelover @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel All of which makes the next 3 weeks for Shazam even more important. With Endgame and Detective Pikachu coming it needs make every bit of money it can. It’s a shame it doesn’t have more time<U+2639><U+FE0F>. It deserves to be bigger b"
"18465","@I_Am_MFR So now Shazam 2 is in motion...how do you do Shazam 2 without Superman showing up?"
"18466","Pet Sematary reboot was literally one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen... save you money and go re-watch Captain Marvel or Shazam... man, what a waste of two hours..."
"18467","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel as they used the history of the comics to create a new story. A Batman who's become more aggressive with no Robin to ground him &amp; a Supeman who is human and has human flaws"
"18468","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel thats fine, have fun seeing it, keep in mind though that biggest opening weekend also means bigger drops in the 2nd, 3rd, etc weekends. Thats another reason why its not bad that Shazam made what it made because it wont have as bad a drop"
"18469","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel there is because Marvel films are ok but they are keeping actual intellectual type films from being made or released because studios sees fans want easy to watch films over films tht make u think. Look at how Man of Steel &amp; BVS were received, they made u think &amp; thats a bad thing"
"18470","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel But again it hasnt opened everywhere yet, there's still quite a few international markets &amp; they've already greenlit Shazam 2 &amp; I have a feeling Black Adam finally having a focus has to do with the success too. WB is very happy with the numbers because they are good numbers"
"18471","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel yea but with the way the media is they would get hell if they had moved it, they would've said ""they are scared of Marvel"" or just to go with the Captain Marvel war they would'e ridiculed WB for moving it away from the imitator"
"18472","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel i stopped seeing MCU films in theaters after Ant Man, can't continue to complain that they keep going back to the bad jokes and one liners than put down money to see the next film."
"18473","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Its low in comparison to what many films of its kind make. WB wouldn't have fast tracked a sequel if they were worried. They put the film in the month of April because they knew that at a low budget it can make a sizable profit &amp; still work well for them. They know all the"
"18474","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel Why do you hate BVS? Suicide Squad I thought was good but you can tell they screwed Ayer's vision up to be like GOTG, which was a crap movie to try to copy."
"18475","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel so you dont like films that make you think, ok thats ur prerogative but as a film fan, not just a comic book fan, but a film fan its disheartening to see how low the quality in films have become all because of money."
"18476","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel When it comes to Marvel films they like to inflate what it may make, when its a DC film they go lower. If it makes that, than all it means is audiences like mediocre films and we'll get more of them. Films like Jaws or Goodfellas are going to be even fewer and further"
"18477","@leon_woodley @SilverScrVideos @wbpictures @ShazamMovie @Marvel competition is going to get in the way, so they are aware of that reality. They will only get worried if they make no profit. They have two weeks to make money before Endgame comes out (which I'm not seein in theaters but will wait for Blu-Ray)"
"18478","Not even a week since shazam came out and we're already getting a sequel, the power"
"18479","Get this in theaters asap. I need a follow-up to that mid-credit scene!"
"18480","Shazam looked lame af in the previews but it was actually decentttt <U+0001F914>"
"18481","A thought I had on Shazam (Spoilers ahead):

Technically, Billy didn't need to go have lunch with Freddy at the end. Freddy was all over the news talking with Shazam… 
Not a plot-hole or anything, since it could be answered in many ways. I just find it interesting."
"18482","@CinematicReturn Well, can't argue with the use of the theme, I can only give my personal interpretation on that:
I love Zimmer's theme, and I like the idea that it's different than Williams'. But Williams' theme is more universal and timeless, which I feel the #ShazamMovie is. [+]"
"18483","Shazam got some weak ass villains tbh you not gone get no ELITE conflict until you hear the rocks entrance music in 2023"
"18484","I thought he quit? Oh noooo here comes the #"

"18486","I’m predicting Shazam 2, Black Adam, Shazam 3...also with intro of the rumored characters in Black Adam I would love more films using them as well ie JSA instead of JL2 &amp; JLD w/ more magic in DCEU explored"
"18487","i’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and say you’re at least 12 based off this tweet and your profile picture."
"18488","I give you...the good shit. Fair, analytical, and features a link to an article about Zachary Levi wanting space for both Shazam and Captain Marvel. An absolute delight."
"18489","me my sister and our daughters went to see this movie Saturday it was awesome but made me cry a lot. So sad such deception"
"18490","FIRE. <U+0001F525> Hilarious. Heart warming. The story line of family being the heart of the film. Entertaining in every way. Zachary Levi BODIED it and the cameos &gt;"
"18491","I'm sending the Santa Signal out to @ADuralde for backup, but I vote ""Yes."""
"18492","@FanboyClay Then that is a more reason to watch it! When Shazam 2 happens, hoping we see something like this but have a feeling I know where the sequel is going to go."
"18493","Wait, Shazam takes place at Christmastime, and they reference and call attention to this?

And they released it in April?

Ew, hard pass."
"18494","You know what I'd have in the Shazam pipeline? An Isis movie. Do that between the second and third Shazam movies."
"18495","The Shazam franchise is an interesting position. Due to Black Adam logistics it can’t follow the typical trilogy format so we’re most likely looking at a Harry Potter style escalation."
"18496","If they work fast is there any reason Shazam 2 couldn't be WB's big Christmas 2020 film?"
"18497","@kissycatclaw @SethKateFan He's promoting more his friend's movie than his own. But #SHAZAM was really good."
"18498","I'm hoping the Shazam sequels follows the Harry Potter franchise direction and becomes it's own big franchise."

"18510","@thenerdyhub @worldofmera Lets dont rush with a Trilogy, A sequel is by no means a sure success because the first one did. This includes WW or Aquaman too. It depends on various factors put together. Shazam will do well but not to the levels of WW or AM."
"18511","@Luiz_Fernando_J @ponysmasher before aquaman? its an insult sorry to say this. ok aquaman requires much more work to be done, but shazam is not even close either to Wonder Woman or Aquaman."
"18512","@JerrellZod2 This must be a joke Shazam better than Aquaman? No comparison at no level, despite the Aquaman coattails, Shazam had the lowest opening weekend ever of a DCEU."
"18513","@DollaBinReviews @SuperComicFun What really gets me is the fact a lot of people seem to think everyone needs to praise this, I mean come on, you'd think they'd stop before trying to claim it's better than objectively better movies.
Shazam was a lot better, but no one is running around praising it like this."
"18514","@nickhaIIII If Shazam was marvel it would be top 5 100 percent. The only movies I can say are debatable better than Shazam are civil war , winter soldier, infinity war and guardians of the galaxy 1"
"18515","Another random thought... It is fascinating to watch AQUAMAN's heroic journey and SHAZAM's villain arc and see GREEN LANTERN as the glorified rough draft of the DC Films formula. The foundations were there, it just didn't work in 2011."
"18516","@Dlund87 @ApolloXCIV @ClassyRampage @Borys_Kit They just hate them and 99% of the time people saying movie is dark or movie is serious as a bad thing is idiotic. Shazam is bad movie. If it weren't for josstice league it would have been the worst movie in DCEU."
"18517","@ApolloXCIV @ClassyRampage @Borys_Kit How? Are we not allowed to say that Shazam is bad movie?"

"18586","@BadB3nny @Complex ""All it takes is one bad day"" 

Does The Rock come out in Shazam?"

                    Who’s laughing now?"

"18590","“The coolest Superhero in the world.”"
"18591","“Give me like five seconds, I'll go get him!”

   He rushes into cover. “Shazam!”

 As lighting hit his body, he transformed.

   “ Excuse me, I heard you were looking for a fight.”"

"18593","@Chris_Moitoza Theres your answer about shazam"
"18594","Shazam is the Christmas of superhero movies... Sorry Jingle All The Way"
"18595","@LightsCameraPod @trillballins Also, he will definitely find the pacing as choppy with weird fluctuations from funny to kinda serious. 

He will probably wish they would’ve explained Shazam’s back sorry a lot more too."
"18596","@michaelrosenbum @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @RealJohnGlover Who do you think killed your dad better, you or Mark Strong? I can’t help but notice the similarities between Thad and Lex."
"18597","@ColliderVideo @PNemiroff With David F. Sandberg having huge success with SHAZAM!  Who should be the next horror filmmaker to direct a superhero movie?  #ColliderMovieTalk"
"18598","Man, I really overshot Shazam!'s box office numbers. It deserves wayyyy more for something as crowd-pleasing as it is. But it's still an impressive return on its investment"
"18599","@wrongdanvers I think it's important for Shazam to do well because that would make the new DCEU Trinity be Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazam. And that should be totes better than tired Supes and Bat. Lol"
"18600","it made me so sad....he said people choose not to see him because of his leg AND I CRIED"
"18601","@Trippandcreech @Forbes An hour? No, alas it's not.  *Unless* you want to do it to see something else there and the theater folks will let you sit in on the SHAZAM trailer reel (which is what I did/usually do when I want to see a bunch of trailers on a giant screen)."
"18602","This might be the best review I've seen yet!"
"18603","Just got out of a late night screening of Shazam! 

The trailers did not do this movie justice. 

I thoroughly enjoyed it and the comedy was fantastic. Definitely recommend for a fun superhero movie before Endgame <U+0001F44F>"
"18604","@Gambit589 @Temi_Oh @tadethompson I genuinely thought Shazam was a new washing powder and was bemused about why so many people were on about it."
"18605","@IseunLuese Good movie. I just didnt like the content. Maybe I don't like shazam as a superhero"
"18606","Saw Shazam! Today and it was fab! I actually love @smugorange so much<U+0001F60D>"
"18607","@Luiz_Fernando_J @ponysmasher I’m guessing we might see both Shazam and Black Adam in 2021"
"18608","@Josh2Gud4U I wouldn’t be surprised if both Shazam 2 and Black Adam are out In 2021"
"18609","You were awesome in @ShazamMovie !! @ZacharyLevi. I hope you get to play him in more movies, greetings from Paraguay"
"18610","@UberKryptonian The good thing is that Shazam himself can appear in JL films without the need to show Billy...

...

What? A boy can dream can’t he?"
"18611","@Inteled_up Shazam and WW"
"18612","Shazam was pretty fun. More fun than I anticipated. And I anticipated lots of fun!!! Go watch it! <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"18613","Great news! The writing was excellent and really fun. The comedy almost always landed, super hard to do in an “action” movie too"
"18614","@ZacharyLevi's posts through promoting #Shazam are a lesson in humility."
"18615","Imagine me going to watch Shazam w my mom and not missing Winter after having already watched it w her. Can't relate"
"18616","@TheFliteCast I would expect Black Adam before the Shazam Sequel"
"18617","The main actors Shazam Max steel are making TomorrowLand happen"
"18618","Shazam was imo the best live action superhero DC have done since Batman Begins"
"18619","the thought of David f sandberg flexing and putting cavill’s Superman and the rock’s Black Adam in the same movie is just... it’s beautiful"
"18620","Oh an the SHAZAM! Score is really good, too. GOOD MOVIE."
"18621","We have been blessed with
Captain Marvel
Shazam
and Endgame"
"18622","The last 20 minutes of Shazam <U+0001F60D>"
"18623","The Shazam sequel hopefully comes out within 2 years and not longer. The older those kids get the more different this premise becomes.

That said, it would be cool if they end the series in the future with adult Billy looking exactly like Shazam just like Kingdom Come did."
"18624","@elmayimbe @HenryGayden @ShazamMovie Was really hopping for some Matt Reeves Batman stuff."
"18625","With today’s news and the Rock saying that they’re going to start filming next year, I think this is what they’re doing."
"18626","Shazam is honestly one of the more delightful superhero origin movies I’ve ever seen"
"18627","@SinemiaApp i used this app for the 1st time to see Shazam! And now it wont work. I keep getting an an Error message! This sounds suspiciously familiar, i.e. Moviepass. Im going to assume Sinemia is in debt"
"18628","@ZacharyLevi We never forget you in our prayers."
"18629","The funniest/weirdest thing I’ve seen on Letterboxd by someone I follow. Praising captain marvel(which is fine it’s not about that) but dragging #shazam cuz it’s unrealistic and can’t happen LmfAo. As if any super hero movie is realistic lol. I found it funny how only one is"
"18630","I wanted to get off my shift and watch Shazam ended up having to get stitches. Boy I'm tired"
"18631","Got around to seeing #Shazam and it did not disappoint! @ZacharyLevi is great and I hope there will be another Justice League film including the character"
"18632","After Suicide Squad, I'm glad to know some Toronto scenes made it into a good movie, Shazam."
"18633","@josephwayne2421 @NerdAgent83 @UpToTASK I’m pretty sure the ad is just saying the Shazam is the only superhero movie released since cap. Marvel and it’s the best automatically because there’s no other superhero movie to compete with it"
"18634","I liked how they introduced the Shazam/Marvel family"
"18635","@UberKryptonian I think that this would be too fast. I think the SHAZAM! team will go slower to allow for BLACK ADAM to take the 2021 spot on its own, then SHAZAM! 2 will come out in 2022 and then the versus movie in 2023. One per year."
"18636","Shazam was funny and wholesome and made me feel like i was watching a superhero movie.

Shazam is therefore the best superhero movie to come out in over 10 years."
"18637","@fareeah @netflix 'Primitive simples. You walking, talking monkeys with your cave drawings. You assume there's only one way to gain magic. No, no, no. There are more ways than a mind can imagine. I name the gods, doctor, not the other way around!'

"18639","@wrytersview You already saw the OG Captqin Marvel with Shazam"
"18640","@From804WithLove They’ve been using different directors (Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam) and so far those have been the best film - I think Snyder just had a producing credit for WW but yeah he’s been mostly gone - next Batman will b a different director too"
"18641","Sitting in the theater to watch @ShazamMovie and saw a preview for @FosseVerdonFX ... this is a great day. @ZacharyLevi  @Lin_Manuel"
"18642","If kids yell Shazam and turn into an adult does that mean that when adults yell Shazam they turn into senior citizens?"
"18643","About to watch Shazam in my favorite seat in this theater. I scoped out the view from the best seat I could manage to get for Endgame. It's pretty good, I lucked out"
"18644","@ColliderVideo @PNemiroff #ColliderMovieTalk did Shazam's early screenings two weeks before the opening help or hurt it's box office?"
"18645","This but make it Shazam 3. Let Mr. Mind/Sivana have Shazam 2 and have the kids level up before they face Adam."
"18646","@FranklinH3000 @TheDCUniverse Err, not quite. WB owns Filmation-produced material that they already had the IP on - SHAZAM, TARZAN, GILLIGAN - but the rest of the stuff went to DreamWorks Animation.
DC has an Isis comic series, but they didn't acquire the character, that went in the Classic Media batch to DW."
"18647","i ghostwrote this"
"18648","Guess producer Peter Safran really did mean what he said to make it fast in order for the kids not to get older."
"18649","@ZacharyLevi OMG just got out of #Shazam (love the monday afternoon movie) and MAN O MAN was it good!! Question : When you talk about Lust and Envy to Savanna, was it a Full Metal Alchemist reference?"
"18650","Now Henry Cavill can post something on Instagram to celebrate both the release AND the sequel of Shazam. The power that that has!"
"18651","I saw #Shazam tonight, but I want people to submit their reviews to be featured on @thefilmagazine so I'm just going to say ""it was all right""."
"18652","1. Wonder Woman is better than almost every Marvel movie
2. Batman Begins is the only interesting Batman movie by Nolan—but it's excellent
3. The modern superhero movie era began with X-Men, and it's still my favorite (perhaps for sentimental reasons)"
"18653","@ponysmasher can you confirm or deny this?"
"18654","So do y’all think that Freddy monetized all the videos on his YouTube channel?
#ShazamMovie"
"18655","The most shocking thing about Aquaman and #Shazam is remembering that, after ten years, yes, DC Comics is capable of making a movie not filmed in sepia tone, or where browns, greys, and blacks are the dominant colors."
"18656","Film 28/29 - Shazam. Another one of those films I wasn’t sure about that I ended up loving. Witty, sweet and lots of fun. Great young actors and a fabulous Zachary Levi genuinely pulling off being a 14 year old body in a man’s body with super powers. Well done DC again"
"18657","Spider-Man Homecoming and Shazam! prove tbat having Ramones songs at the end credits is a fantastic idea"
"18658","@BossC86 Also Shazam was very good, one of the few DC films I actually enjoyed. I reckon you’ll like it"
"18659","@the_hoyk @TheDCUniverse The new Shazam restoration documentary on DC Universe has a guy saying ""Warner Bros. acquired Filmation,"" which would then be inaccurate. What you're saying is what I thought was the case."
"18660","So, I gave Shazam a chance and imma be honest. I loved it. Glad to see DC getting a greater sense of humor with its movies (Skipped everything after BVS, btw) and just having fun with it. Characters are great, action is tight, and the effects were pretty good. Zach Levi killed-"
"18661","Saw #Shazam a second time. Tell people to go see it. Bring kids, friends, parents, anybody. It’s great."
"18662","Too ill to go and see Shazam! tonight, will have to see how I feel tommorow night."
"18663","okay gonna turn off my phone but !!! prepare my stan card bc i’m about to go <U+26A1><U+FE0F> SHAZAM!"

"18666","Wait but can this really be a thing"
"18667","@xboxuk @JoMTurner would have the super power to grow vegetable that are low fat and taste like chocolate! #Shazam #ShazamXbox"
"18668","@TheHorrorGuru I just came back from watching it. yo, I marked out so hard, I accidentally blurted out in the theater the names of certain Shazam!-affiliated characters upon realizing they were about to be introduced. you know which ones"
"18669","never are we gonna forget that jack dylan grazer is actually a terrible person just because he’s in the shazam movie. nah. his apologies were actually bullshit i said what i said"
"18670","@BlackMajikMan90 Black Adam was confirmed by The Rock himself. Which has nothing to do with Shazam 2"
"18671","I actually did enjoy Shazam. I will have a thread of movies sI'e seen from March up later this week."
"18672","@ShazamMovie Well worth the title!!!! I can honestly say this movie has brought many people together!"
"18673","I am going and watch back @ShazamMovie right now I love this movie so so much and congrats on #number1 @AsherAngel"
"18674","Shazam is #1 in the world congrats guys @AsherAngel @ShazamMovie"
"18675","@staryabos @zeke_oakley I love homecoming and I’ve seen it like 8 times and not ONCE during Shazam did I even think about homecoming.... people are really reaching for something to complain about. I don’t understand why people create unnecessary beef between films that weren’t meant to be compared."
"18676","@Marvel @JimmyKimmelLive Shazam and DC is infinitely better than the vomit Marvel churns out"
"18677","Really solid article from @JacobSHall articulating a bothersome missed opportunity in an otherwise super fun movie."
"18678","@TCDoesComics Disgusts me people think Shazam is better than any of the DC solo films. 80M budget shows."
"18679","This thread <U+0001F447> ps @GailSimone reading this gave me the warm fuzzies and I need to skip work and see Shazam again #Shazam"
"18680","@theonlytroyever You don't remember the scene where Shazam looked to the camera for a solid 2 minutes and made constant self aware jokes?"
"18681","Yep. But Ghostbusters had a budget of $150mil. Studios then spend that again on advertising, so Ghostbusters had to make $300mil just to break even. 
Shazam was $90mil, so $53mil on opening IS brilliant"
"18682","DC is really improving, shazam was AMAZING!! I can’t wait to see the new joker movie"
"18683","Back in LA. Got my 4th wind. Time to go see the #BigRedCheese finally kick some booty in theatres!
#SHAZAM"
"18684","He smoked weed and didn’t even inhale it.."
"18685","the stench"
"18686","I really want to see Shazam.

Hopefully I’ll be able to see it tomorrow with my brother."
"18687","@ColliderVideo @PNemiroff @HaleighFoutch @MrJayWashington With the idea of “Superhero Fatigue” ever present, movies like Shazam seem to keep the genre fresh. What upcoming superhero movies do you think will keep the genre fresh/ help to further the genre? #ColliderMovieTalk"
"18688","with that end it’s OBVIOUS SO I HOPE TO SEE AT LEAST 1 MINUTE HENRY’S FACE"
"18689","There’s actually several <U+0001F44D>"
"18690","@TheOnlyJamesMan Shazam 2 and a black Adam movie <U+0001F60D><U+0001F62D>"
"18691","@Handlebrody So Freddy is one of my favorite superheroes since I was a kid. You absolutely killed it in Shazam. Just wanted to say that."
"18692","@ponysmasher I greatly enjoyed Shazam, but I also REALLY loved your performance as you-know-who. I was cackling at how delightfully evil you were."
"18693","before i release my Shazam review I've been obsessed with the Shazam transformation effect, think I'm gonna give that a go then upload the review."
"18694","read this thread, Shazam! is such a blessing and this is further proof of authenticity (<U+0001F923>) of what I mean"
"18695","@essdubyavee @GraceRandolph See and people said this about captain marvel but it wasn’t true, only for Shazam lol"
"18696","@JacobSHall Great article on body positivity and superheroes. I had the same exact thoughts when I saw Shazam. (Including the part that it’s a fantastic movie and you should see it.)"
"18697","Great article on body positivity and superheroes. I had the same exact thoughts when I saw Shazam. (Including the part that it’s a fantastic movie and you should see it.)"
"18698","Shazam was so bad that me and Siobhán left after 20 mins even though we get to see movies for free. Just saying"
"18699","Getting ready to watch Shazam!"
"18700","@UberKryptonian I'm cool with this, but I need a different director for Shazam vs Black Adam."
"18701","It's been so long since I've seen a fun ass superhero movie. And it came from DC! Thank you! #Shazam"
"18702","@freshyrosay Yeah, but he gave more information.  Like he is the reason they are doing separate origin stories for each, instead of the same movie.  He also said the other heros are going down.  I think it was just to add publicly for Shazam, since he's a Producer."
"18703","My best friend would have the super power of making anyone happy. If everyone could find their happy the world would be a safer and kinder place."
"18704","Not to say i didnt enjoy captain marvel at all, i did find some of it enjoyable, it just lacked something spontaneous, for lack of a better word, Shazam! Was a risky character to bring to life, the idea of a child with god like strength, is hard to adapt to film...."
"18705","So in my opinion, #Shazam is the better film."
"18706","Shazam! Has a better story, and a way better and heartfelt character arc then that of Captain Marvel. Rather than telling you everything in the span of a few minutes at the end of the 2nd act, you follow Billy's journey from beginning to end ....."
"18707","Shazam is a breath of fresh air in the remainder of the DCEU, and continues to prove that their solo character films massively preform better than their team up films. Captain marvel on the other hand, is just another marvel film that stays inside the comfort zone..."
"18708","Shazam! is my new ~I’m sad and want to sit alone in a movie theatre~ movie"
"18709","Went to Shazam! Some good homages to the DC verse hidden throughout. Fairly sure folk wouldn't have known who the DCverse Captain Marvel is before now. Hope he crosses over to the next Justice League movie."
"18710","Also..... if anyone is just now discovering how awesome @ZacharyLevi is after watching @ShazamMovie please do yourself a favor and check out @nbcchuck One of my favorite tv shows and well worth your time #Chuck #Shazam"
"18711","Saw @ShazamMovie and it was everything I thought it would be. The moment they casted my boy Chuck the fantastic @ZacharyLevi I knew he would bring everything needed to a character that goes from child to adult hero. He truly encapsulated the character of #Shazam and Billy<U+0001F44F>"

"18717","@TheFliteCast I don’t mind what the properties are, I didn’t care about Aquaman till the film was announced, same for Shazam, I realised how cool the characters where after the fact

It’s just exciting to see new things as well as expansions of the old"
"18718","@TheFliteCast Maybe I’m not making myself clear, I’m hyped as hell for these sequels, but Aquaman and Shazam both fall in the lighter, action side of things!

I want differing films through out the year to break it up a bit

Something old something new something borrowed something blue beetle"
"18719","@TheFliteCast I’m just spitballing my thoughts, still a little too early I think to comment on Hamada’s control but if he was behind Aquamans and Shazam’s release campaigns then <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>"
"18720","@PabloPonce1985 It’s just the film it’s being compared against in most circles, just wanted to state that Shazam is actually performing a decent bit better"

Great idea huh!?

Bullshit!!!

This movie taught me that you can play the tropes if you’re playing them well! Fantasy doesn’t have to drown your plot with world building. We know what Wizards are. That’s all we need!"

"18812","Guess I'll be eating food again."
"18813","Naw missed the movie guess I’m watching shazam"

"18843","@FoolintheMask Definitely recommend. It was a really fun movie. Some parts are kinda slow, but once Billy becomes Shazam, then it gets good. Also, the villain was very intimidating."

“Why is Star Wars VIII a success while Chips starting Michael Peña a flop?”"
"18861","Shazam was released in the spring, expectations are lower for movies during spring, in summer $46m opening weekend is a flop. You’re comparing apples and oranges.
On top of that Shazam recouped 50% of its budget on opening weekend whereas Ghostbusters barely got over 1/4th."

"18944","@LovinaYavari Did you hear Shazam is getting a sequel?’ You simply must reprise your role as Aloof Convenience Store Girl!"
"18945","Well that’s got to be a new record for getting a sequel"
"18946","the unanimous love for #shazam brings me much joy oh mylanta

"18950","@ZacharyLevi ughh I wish I had unlimited money to watch Shazam over and over and over again! Guess I gotta wait until the bluray release.... struggle is real"
"18951","Mark, I couldn’t even focus through half the movie because all I could picture was jimmy Fallon as a super hero it was so distracting but overall great movie"
"18952","t to see Shazam on saturday, and they played the Dark Phoenix trailer
ya know, the trailer that still said ""Coming to Theaters FEBRUARY 14th""

Saturday was April 6th.
Fox."
"18953","@ZacharyLevi Mr. Shazam — One question: did you have anything to do with the decision to have “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen playing while testing out your powers in the movie? 

PERFECT SONG CHOICE."
"18954","@ZacharyLevi london is covered in shazam posters and seeing your face everywhere makes me so happy also shazam was great mate need 200000 sequels thanks"
"18955","My favorite part of Shazam was when I lost my shit in the theater over a cameo and I don’t want to spoil any more than that"
"18956","I have tiny little feeling that maybe, just maybe Gail loved #Shazam"
"18957","This woman Lucy on letterboxd really gave SHAZAM! 1 and 1/2 stars. I unfollowed."
"18958","@ZacharyLevi You are terrific in #Shazam. Laughed so hard. Great movie."
"18959","It’s been 3 weeks since I’ve seen #Shazam and I can’t stop thinking about how perfect @ZacharyLevi was in it, and how the movie is just a giant ball of sunshine <U+26A1><U+FE0F><U+0001F60E>"
"18960","game of thrones, endgame, shazam, mortal  kombat 11, and the draft?"

Billy is just Billy.  The wizard is Shazam. Billy is no more ""Shazam"" than Black Adam or Mary is.

In summary, I don't care anymore."
"18965","Yesterday while I was shopping at @hm I heard a really cool song and couldn’t Shazam it :/"
"18966","@PaigeyyRebeccax So I saw it! You weee the final sway! And it exceeded my expectations, they nailed the character of Shazam pretty damn perfect."
"18967","After watching @ZacharyLevi in #Shazam, I’m starting to develop a crush"
"18968","@ZacharyLevi I saw @ShazamMovie the opening day at @regalcinemas1 @UnionSquareNY 7:30pm showing. What a splendid film driven entirely by Zac Levi as a theatre-trained actor giving the film depth &amp; psychological presence &amp; challenging the bounds of comedy. Congrats on the #1 spot."
"18969","I saw Shazam two times in a week! It's so amazing, joyful and so well done!! Loved your performance @ZacharyLevi, you always make me proud of you! <U+2764><U+FE0F>"

"18971","Saw #Shazam two times:
1st time was 04/03 (very first day in Italy and first theater turn in my city) with my 11 yo Nephew and my 67 yo Dad: THEY LOVED IT!
2nd time was with one of my best friend and her family: THEY LOVED IT TOO!
I'm a good influencer <U+0001F601>@ZacharyLevi"
"18972","You are? Thanks! I’m a huge longtime fan of y’all. I’m so sorry about Scott. Much love to the Shazam!"
"18973","@ZacharyLevi Shazam is my party animal.

Thanks for being such a great heroe."
"18974","Alright @ZacharyLevi we're about to hop in the car and go see Shazam. Wish me luck!"
"18975","We're dying to see The Aftermath, not Shazam"
"18976","@ShazamMovie  my family this is the real inclusion, I loveit  is may life inself"
"18977","@ZacharyLevi I love Shazam so much. I’m going to watch it again this week, this time with my brother <U+0001F970>"
"18978","The good thing about Shazam movie is it opens the big possibly of the second movie. Billy is still learning about his responsibilities and I think it’s a good pace."
"18979","Shazam was amazing and it’s even better knowing the direction in which they’re headed. Shazam could be the next Harry Potter if they play their cards right"
"18980","@ZacharyLevi I'm so proud for you! Shazam is amazing!!!

Ps. I love u <U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"18981","i love shazam! i love! shazam! wish i could stop thinking about it! but alas!"
"18982","@ZacharyLevi i love you and i am so proud of you and all the team of shazam!"
"18983","@ZacharyLevi 
I can't wait to see more of your work! You are an amazing actor and person! You give so much of yourself to your work and your fans. My dream is to someday get to meet you in person.  Keep up the great work and here's hoping for a Chuck movie and alot more Shazam."
"18984","If you haven't seen Shazam! yet, you really should. People are enjoying the humor and the message about family, but there's a deeper message I'm not seeing mentioned: About how arbitrary it is to be ""special"" and how children can be deeply affected by the way adults treat them"
"18985","Saw Shazam yesterday. Missed the 1st 5 mins but it's fine. ...IT WAS GREAT <U+0001F604> Wasn't as funny as I hoped cause ppl overhyped the humor but man, I really enjoyed it! The last 20 mins were &lt;kisses fingers&gt; PERFECTION. And the ending had me gasping <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> What a bunch of trolls <U+0001F602>"
"18986","Did you read Detective Comics #1000? What were your thoughts? Listen in to Mitch's, along with Lucas and Larry's review of this milestone release. The guys also talk about DC bringing the fun with the Shazam film"
"18987","Had free tix to newly renovated @AMCTheatres so we checked out @ShazamMovie today. Wasn’t all that impressed, and felt a little dirty for cheating on @Marvel.  My opinion - save your money, and go see #EndGame"
"18988","Want some edibles and watch Shazam"
"18989","\ In the whole DC v Marvel debate (which is stupid) where and how in God's green earth is it okay to pin Homecoming against Shazam¿ 

Stans in general piss me off. Jfc. 
SIT DOWN. 
    (nor directed @ OP obvs)."
"18990","About to watch #Shazam with my son! #JustSayTheMagicWord
Prestes a assistir #Shazam com o meu filho!"
"18991","Going to see Shazam now.. @ZacharyLevi my hopes are so high.. please let it be a good one.."
"18992","The two best praises I can give to a movie are: leaving me with a big grin on my face, and dealing out emotional gut-punches.

SHAZAM! was a wondrous experience and I'm endlessly happy to sit down for a followup."
"18993","@ZacharyLevi Congrats on all the success of #Shazam I truly enjoyed it &amp; you deserve all these happinessss <U+0001F970>"
"18994","Waiting to watch shazam @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie"
"18995","Round of applause for the real star of #Shazam. @ZacharyLevi butt <U+0001F60D> <U+0001F351>"
"18996","I’m unsure if I want to see  Shazam"
"18997","Shazam is a good film. A lot of funny parts."
"18998","@GothamsRose ""That is true. With one simple kiss you made me yours. The power of Shazam is yours to use."" 
-Billy awkwardly smiles-"
"18999","I feel insecured, but Aquaman I think.
(I gotta rewatch Aquaman and Shazam)"
"19000","Hey @ZacharyLevi , can I wear a Nerd Herd shirt to go see Shazam? Is that okay?"
"19001","I literally don’t know what Shazam is beyond the app where you sing to find out the name of a song"
"19002","Everyone needs to see #Shazam, @ZacharyLevi is so charismatic and it made me fall in love with him even more!"
"19003","@BatmanNewsCom I mean, I think a Superman/Shazam team up film would be a natural progression."
"19004","PLEASE it’s so good I’ve seen it twice"
"19005","I can tell you're a good guy @ZacharyLevi and I'm happy the rest of the world is finding that out as well now. 
I love you as Chuck / Eugene / #Shazam but mostly as your awesome self that started Nerd HQ.
Please never change. 
Love from Slovakia <U+2764>"
"19006","I hadn't seen Meagan Good in a good minute &amp; then she just popped up around the end of Shazam lmaooo she was looking mighty delicious too!"
"19007","Since I can't seem to get home, time to watch Shazam :)"
"19008","Just watched #Shazam and it’s a really good movie. The jokes are on point <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB> congrats @ZacharyLevi"

"19010","@GraceRandolph @ScottMendelson Opines. I also don't think it's about having hardcore fans in the initial screenings, they'd often be gone by Saturday anyway. @DCComics now need to do Black Adam and world build around big bads. Tell the Thanos story before Avengers Infinity, Joker is the right idea. #SHAZAM"
"19011","@brettwhite I enjoyed Shazam but it did feel like a kids movie from the 90’s. Honestly wasn’t expecting anything over the top with this character. Would’ve enjoyed a little more adventure vibe. Still worth seeing."
"19012","I ""saw"" Shazam, meaning I watched the beginning and passed TF out in the theater <U+0001F62A>"
"19013","Quick review of Shazam: A fun, light-hearted super movie that was consistently entertaining throughout. 9/10 would see again."
"19014","People really need to realize that Henry HASN'T left the role of Superman.
I'm getting really tired of fans saying 'please bring back Henry'. 
Calm tf down, he's not going anywhere."
"19015","@johne1998 Rankings are for losers<U+0001F913>

"19016","Ok so @ZacharyLevi I want to thank you for being one of the stars of the first superhero movie that my mom has asked me to go with her too in at least 5 years @ShazamMovie was great and I can’t wait to see it again!!"

"19019","Shazam - surprising and unexpected. Recommended."
"19020","Thread. Agree with all of it. #Shazam"
"19021","Had to work this past weekend and didn't get to go see @ShazamMovie !  Guess this girl will have to wait until Thursday.  I keep hearing amazing things about @ZacharyLevi  <U+0001F60D>"
"19022","Go see @ShazamMovie right now! Ton of heart, funny, and gets the family message right. Best DC movie to date! @AsherAngel nails it as Billy Batson, and @ZacharyLevi is the perfect Captain Marvel."
"19023","Thinkin about paying a dozen dollars for a ticket that says Shazam on it just to see this 5 minute exclusive trailer for Godzilla: King of the Monsters"
"19024","@ScottMendelson Shazam! is surprisingly illuminated by Green Lantern. It's a more charming trip down the same path (although the signs are just as weak a big bad as Parallax)."
"19025","I have to watch Shazam<U+26A1> I need that dose of DCEU  film but I know I'll forever miss the dark ones from Sny//der. I'm living for the dark themed movies yeah, I love those more."
"19026","@mrity212 @lukegranders @TheComixKid basically take the budget and times it by 3, that's your break even. anything over it divide by 2 is ur profit
so Shazam budget=around 90M - break even=270M
already made 159M worldwide, so should make 400M+, therefore profit should be 60M+ at least, and should do well on rentals"
"19027","@TheComixKid @mrity212 Do u see them still going for Rock vs SZ vs Sup in Shazam 3 &amp; if so how r they planning to use Sup before that? Thx"
"19028","@AsherAngel I heard you say in a live stream once that you would like to get to play fortnite with your fans. So at some point would you be able to play fortnite with my little brother? Btw we just saw Shazam and it was awesome! :)"
"19029","I’ve seen #SHAZAM twice already, and I can’t wait to see it again! @ZacharyLevi is perfect <U+0001F44C> <U+0001F60D>"
"19030","I just saw #Shazam and its AMAZING!!!!!!"
"19031","Do yourself a favor this week and see Shazam. I was absolutely blown out of the water and was so happy it's something I loved. Great choice of @ZacharyLevi, such a cool dude!"
"19032","@DarinDePaul just watched Shazam! great performance as the sins from you and fred, perfectly threatening! well done man!"
"19033","I’m suing you for copy right"
"19034","@caroldanvcr your irls don’t deserve you honestly. wish we lived closer i swear we would be going out to watch shazam and celebrate u today. love you &lt;3"
"19035","@ZacharyLevi I bet that kid will be the only Shazam in his/her class!!"
"19036","@thomasp0003 @wesleywhite626 Also, Shazam! was a pretty inexpensive movie. It'd be more surprising to see them *not* greenlight a sequel."
"19037","Now if #Shazam had just visited a #Wawa. That would have completed the Philly feel."
"19038","@GailSimone @ZacharyLevi I enjoyed the hell out of #Shazam as well. One thing I want to say: I love that it was in Philadelphia. Not Philadelphia as Fawcett City. Actual Philadelphia. With Septa buses and Geno's Steaks. I admit I felt a little pride (oh, no! one of the sins!) at having a local hero."
"19039","Shazam: 6.0/10

+the performances were good all around
+the twist at the end was handled very well I thought

-villain was an absolute 0, even if maybe some of it was supposed to be comedic and over the top"
"19040","Sounds like #Shazam 2 is already in development from the original writer  yay! <U+0001F60A><U+2764><U+26A1>"
"19041","i went to go see Shazam! with my bf yesterday and it was so funny <U+0001F62D> the ending was so unexpected in the best way possible, it made my heart happy <U+0001F607> lol"

"19046","@ZacharyLevi That was a sweet story about the concept of family just as much as it was about superheroes.  You guys should all be very proud of what you did, hoping for many sequels in the future #Shazam"
"19047","Because none of you asked, my current DCEU rankings:

1.) Man of Steel
2.) BvS
3.) Shazam
4.) Wonder Woman
5.) Aquaman
6.) Justice League
7.) Suicide Squad

(SN: The differences between #2-#5 are VERY marginal.)"
"19048","not to be overdramatic, shazam really saved my 2019"
"19049","Off to watch Shazam!

I only watch Captain Marvel movies now"
"19050","I’m conflicted <U+0001F610> I’d love to know what you think."
"19051","Saw @ShazamMovie with some friends on Friday, and I haven't been able to not think about it since. @ZacharyLevi never fails to impress! Broadway to big screen; he is just a legend!"
"19052","Never go many places alone. The one time I saw a movie by myself was because of a very sad/awkward situation. That was for Zootopia. Might have to do it again for #Shazam because feel good movies and @ZacharyLevi, right? <U+0001F62C> RIGHT?!"
"19053","@MarchHareInJune @GianncarloI @ojichan72 @Rob_readscomics @CharlesOfShred @Snapple2Apple @RicoReadsComics @MrNoFollowers @CaptainBacon61 @marsanj47 @ComicsFred @marvel_mmo @grelan @jared_webb1 @MrNiceGuy18_58 @CanadaDaredevil @Nerdgrounds @NerdgroundsBRG @cosmicblackdude @MakeMineAmalgam Frankenstein's ""monster"" would still be a Frankenstein although it does irk me a little. I think Shazam bothers me more because you say captain marvel and people think another universe completely and when you say Frankenstein, you still think the books characters"
"19054","This is actually pretty cool... Can’t wait to see how Friday turns out. <U+0001F440>"
"19055","Monday's #96SecondNews: Franzia now has ADULT JUICE BOXES, the @astros swept the A's in all 3 games this weekend, @ShazamMovie came in at #1 at the box office, and more! #TheMorningMIX"
"19056","I really need to stop watching trailers for movies. Quite a few moments for Shazam shoulda hit harder had I not seen them in the trailer"
"19057","No agenda, no politics. Simply magic- both onscreen and in my moviegoing experience. Make yourselves a favor and make Shazam! a success #I<U+2764><U+FE0F>Shazam!"
"19058","Of course I'm happy about this I'm also very excited on the comic book accuracy since hamada and safran have taken over ."
"19059","So to the people dissing the #shazam box office . Warner brothers are so dissapointed with the box office there already green lighting a sequel <U+0001F602><U+0001F923> some of you YouTubers are such insincere people"
"19060","Zachary Levi, Adam Brody, DJ Catrona, Meagan Good, Michelle Borth.

Cast director of Shazam did well with casting good looking humans. I was trying my best to control myself."
"19061","This thread is so good. If you had any doubts about going to see Shazam, read this thread, or just go see it. It’s so good, funny, heartwarming, and charming. Definitely one of my new favorite superhero movies, I was so pleasantly surprised they nailed it this well! #SHAZAM"
"19062","@Odd_Cinderella @ShazamMovie @geoffjohns @1moreGaryFrank It's about 190 pages collected edition. And the current series has released 4 issues so far."
"19063",".@geoffjohns' SHAZAM! dragged me into Shazam! world deeply. I loved Captain Marvel series from Golden Age, I loved Pre-Flashpoint series, I loved Animated version. But this book is very SPECIAL to me, because I became a translator and a comic artist thanks to this book."
"19064","Any Justice League sequel probably should center around Shazam w/Aquaman, Flash &amp; Wonder Woman, maybe an off-world story that could introduce Green Lantern and/or Martian Manhunter. Meanwhile, at Hall of Justice, Batman &amp; Superman could be left behind &amp; perhaps simply mentioned."
"19065","PLEASE DC do more movies like Shazam, this is really good!!!!"
"19066","So what did you guys think of Shazam? I loved it!"
"19067","i wanna read flash and shazam comics
they seem cute"
"19068","Honestly, I have to get to @ShazamMovie because when trailer came out I said “yoooo, that’s the funny kid from #it and from @MeMyselfAndICBS (whom @CBS , I still got issues with) . Honestly It’s why I intotially wanted to see it , his acting is great @Jgrazerofficial  . #Shazam"
"19069","I knew this would happen.
I effing knew it. 
#Hellboy is coming out in a couple of days but it's been completely overshadowed by both the success of #Shazam and the hype for #AvengersEndgame.
Big Red deserves better."
"19070","Wanna cry it out or laugh it out and he said you’re gonna watch 5 Feet Apart at 7:45pm and then Shazam at 10:10pm on the house. When I tell you that I started tearing up again... The devil works hard but God is always with me. Now on to Shazam rocking my socks off <U+0001F60A>"
"19071","So I came to the movies to see the movie I missed yesterday and when the manager came up he was super cool and nice. And I asked him if he’s seen 5 Feet Apart. Then I proceeded to say that I couldn’t choose between that one and Shazam. I said, if you’ve had a bad day... would you"

"19074","Agreed, much more genuine and the humor didn’t feel forced"
"19075","WB released theatrical cut of JL: They spend another 50 million dollars, gott 40%  on RT, endlessly embarassed by Cavill's CGI face, die hard fans mad, regular people endlessly rag on the film, Aquaman and Shazam still are successful."
"19076","WB released a 2 hour version of Snyder Cut of JL to theaters: They save 50 million dollars, get 27% on RT, please more fans, Aquaman and Shazam still are successful.

It's still better than reshooting half the movie! Amazing...unless you HATE #ZackSnyder beyond reason."
"19077","The  scene where the kid drops the Batman and Superman figures is not ""an  intentional slight"" by David F. Sandberg against #BatmanvSuperman and  #ManofSteel. <U+0001F644> It was just a joke. The kid is like ""forget Batman and  Superman, #Shazam is where it's at!"""
"19078","Next they'll be saying Batman fumbling around with his grappling hook or #Shazam beating Superman at arm wrestling in the end credits sequence  is an intentional slight at #ZackSnyder or Shazam making out with  Wonder Woman is high praise of #PattyJenkins."
"19079","RLM seriously thinks that shot of the kid dropping his Batman and Superman figures was ""an intentional slight"" against Man of Steel and BVS? <U+0001F644>

It was a joke. ""Forget Batman and Superman, Shazam is where it's at!"" is what that scene is about. Not about hating the early DCEU film"
"19080","WB released a 2 hour version of Snyder Cut of JL to theaters: They save 50 million dollars, get 27% on RT, please more fans, Aquaman and Shazam still are successful.  It's still better than reshooting half the movie! Amazing...unless you HATE #ZackSnyder beyond reason."
"19081","If WB released the Snyder Cut of JL to theaters: They save 50 million dollars, get 27%  on RT, please die hard fans, Aquaman and Shazam still are successful.

If someone can explain why this scenario is worse, I'm all ears."
"19082","Finally, RLM ends with ""If you are an adult man attending Shazam by yourself, you should be ashamed and embarrassed of yourself."" <U+0001F644><U+0001F644>"

"19086","@TheNelGOD WW has a weak third act, shitty villain, and Diana butchering soldiers she believes are innocent pawns. Aquaman has the worst second act of any DCEU movie bar JL. Shazam looks like your standard Phase 3 MCU movie. BvS is great for the first two acts but falls apart in the third."
"19087","Watching SHAZAM in a few hours, not rocking his outfit but let's hope the movie is decent :D"
"19088","Just saw #SHAZAM and I cannot recommend it enough. I don't think I have seen such a fun movie in ages. Lots of nostalgic references and took me back to reading old yellow comics. See it, just go!"

Gj #SHAZAM"
"19090","#shazam was great!

Affecting 1st act, dull as dirt 2nd act where it's just going thru the motions of superhero tropes, GREAT 3rd act that was somehow not spoiled by the trailers.
Family friendly

Mid credits stinger is plot, post credits is a joke

6/10, worth checking out"
"19091","So an extended 5 minute preview of #GodzillaKingOfTheMonsters was shown before the IMAX screenings of #SHAZAM this weekend and the anticipation for this #film has been phenomenal. For those who saw #SHAZAM this past weekend, what were your thoughts on the preview for #Godzilla?"

"19093","@ZacharyLevi seems like the sweetest, most positive cat, ever. That and him crushing it in @ShazamMovie gets him a follow from me!"
"19094","@DannySmithRFLZ @TheDetMI @BurnN8or101 But Shazam had an overall more enjoyable story and it clearly shows. It has heart, it takes its self serious when it needs to, and it's just another great solo movie into the DCEU along sith WW and Aquaman. Money isn't everything."
"19095","Captain Marvel needed better emotional grounding and better character writing whereas Shazam needed a better villain and better visuals. DC, please stop it with the 2009 level CGI"
"19096","I wish I could take the bad ass good girl moments from Captain Marvel and mix it with the awesome acting and surprisingly deep emotional roots from Shazam. And yet here I am with two movies I only mostly enjoyed."
"19097","@slines @Shazam Written by Kris Kristofferson, of course"
"19098","I consider this a Doom Patrol/Shazam crossover."
"19099","@MikeKalinowski And the reason that every MCU movie does well now is that they all connect, and people know that. DC ones don’t, which is why something like Shazam opens smaller. Doesn’t play into other films."
"19100","@FlashpointMovie You haven’t seen Shazam, so no. WW third act is weak, but complaining about it when marvel does the same shit makes you a marvel Stan"
"19101","@FlashpointMovie The DCEU is flawed, but WW, Aquaman and Shazam are really strong and BvS is solid."
"19102","@BurnettRM you know I’m a big fan, so I say this with love, but you didn’t like Shazam very much when you praise every mediocre marvel film? That was very surprising to hear. I’m kind of in shock!"
"19103","@Xyro77 @MikeKalinowski The only reason Captain Marvel opens that big is because it connects to the MCU. If it didn’t, it would open like Shazam did."
"19104","@FlashpointMovie Sorry but Shazam and WW are better than your 2,3,5, and 7. So is Aquaman."
"19105","All I wanna really say about the Shazam movie is, if you wanted him to fight Black Adam you should have just used Black Adam instead of giving Dr Sivana basically the same powers."
"19106","I've seen both Captain Marvel and Shazam. Captain Marvel is a better movie overall, but Shazam isn't a bad movie. Worth watching in theaters for sure. 

Also I don't know why people are trying to compare them, it's two different types of stories so... yeah"
"19107","@HenryGayden Thank you my friend for doing what you have done! You have no idea what the Shazam film means to me."
"19108","Watching #Shazam rn and the girl in front of me just said “Edna said no capes”"
"19109","and what about it"
"19110","im trying to find cute shazam art to rt but theres a bunch of furry shit in the tags this house is a fucking nightmare"
"19111","Saw Shazam! this weekend and loved every minute of it. @ZacharyLevi is amazing. @AsherAngel as Billy is amazing as well. One of my favorite movies this year!!! Well done, dudes!!!<U+0001F917><U+0001F60D><U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F49B><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F>"
"19112","Even worse tho is like who actually watches these movies and nitpicks them to the point where they are like tHeY StOleD fRoM tHiS lmao.  People need to go outside every now and then."
"19113","Finished pet Cemetery... it was okay. Now for the first time in years I sneaked into another movie. Shazam is next<U+0001F918><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F92A>"
"19114","Shazam has more heart to it than like 95% of Marvel movies honestly."
"19115","i genuinely cannot pick because they all mean so much to me...like if i had to boil it down i think it’s between ww and shazam at the moment"
"19116","Shazam is everything I thought it was.. :)"
"19117","*watching Shazam*

*Sees Dr.Sivana*

Me: didn't this guy sang country road and died why is he here?"
"19118","""I'm so thrilled to be this way!"""
"19119","Man kinda sucks I slept thru Shazam because I really wanted to watch that movie <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"

Billy and Freddie buying alcohol and then immediately spitting it out and going back to buy regular junk food was some quality content and honestly mood"
"19123","Me: stop liking more things you have enough hobbies and interests with no time 

Also me: *looks up every zachery Levi interview and reading into shazam*"
"19124","Quick question about @ShazamMovie My six year old is kind of sensitive, but I’m hoping to take him...anyone seen it that could say yea or nay?  He handled the bumblebee movie okay, not great, and on our small screen."
"19125","This is terrible and nonsensical. #Shazam"
"19126","@TreyAdell Haven’t seen Shazam yet but I know what you mean. That said, the Guardians movies have a ton of heart"
"19127","Saw Shazam! Today. Pretty impressed honestly. I was going in with low hopes based on DC’s track record and the trailer for the movie. A great balance of comedy and action, the child actors were fantastic and stole the show. I’d say give it a watch. 7.3/10"
"19128","@SEN1227 @ShazamMovie @geoffjohns @1moreGaryFrank Oh! Lol. I thought that was the novel version of the Movie. Lol. That makes me happy to be disappointed. Lol. Thank you again!"
"19129","@PollOG54 Most definitely. But Shazam is a step in the right direction. I can’t wait for the sequels"
"19130","@PollOG54 DC cinema hasn’t been very good, but Shazam was a great movie and definitely a step in the right direction for them. Although, I heard aqua man was good too, but i haven’t seen it. I personally thought captain marvel was whatever, despite all the hype."
"19131","@PollOG54 Captain marvel was rushed to fill in the gaps for endgame. I blame marvel for doing that. It could’ve been better if they had released after endgame or planned way ahead before infinity war came out. Shazam is so far my favorite DC movie and man I thought the story flowed perfect"
"19132","Wonderful news. They very clearly “get” the character."
"19133","I liked Shazam!, but this is bullshit. Man of Steel came out 6 years ago, and we can’t get a goddamn sequel? @WarnerBrosEnt @DCComics"
"19134","@theshazamcast @SuperheroPOLL @GeekVibesNation @PFE2_ @jared_webb1 @marsanj47 @GianncarloI @SentryIsVoid @4EyedIceCube @DT2ComicsChat @MrNiceGuy18_58 Very true, it is an incredibly slippery slope for writers when they try to incorporate a love interest into Shazam. The thought primarily going into this was that it would be a relationship for Billy Batson, not his alter ego. Still tricky, I will admit."
"19135","I wanna go see #shazam again mostly just because that moment when @ZacharyLevi is laughing and then in the blink of an eye gets serious and says ""you're dead"" is just one of many moments from that movie that reminds me of what I wanna be able to do as an actor"
"19136","Yeah Shazam was pretty good, but why the Power Rangers come out of nowhere?"
"19137","@Aaronrodz13 Nigga said lemme Shazam instead of asking the homie <U+0001F614>"

"19141","I still need to watch Shazam."
"19142","I have to say that I was impressed by @ShazamMovie. It had the funny, the emo, and the action. Very nice story as well."
"19143","@duckie7582 Ha, I would take it! Throw the other DC characters into something absolutely ridiculous, why not? I would also love anything with all the kids/their Shazam counterparts, though. Those older casting choices were absolutely on point."
"19144","This thread is making me feel a lot of things but mostly that I REALLY need to go see #Shazam again. <U+0001F60D>"
"19145","@ZacharyLevi From brunette to silver in only six decades! (Actually started going gray in my teens, but dyed it till my 50s for lack of confidence). Can’t wait to see #ShazamMovie myownself!"
"19146","shazam is the best movie EVER"
"19147","im so proud of shazam cast i love they so much"
"19148","Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un is real life inspiration for Shazam!"
"19149","i wish i could say shazam and suddenly be in dom mode and its just me but with cool boots and a chain in dom space"
"19150","Shazam is probably in my top 5 favorite superhero movies. Top 10 easily."
"19151","this is really really good though to have radio stations like smallzy and ash london promoting bc they’re the most listened to radio stations within australia. y’all know what that means. local attention<U+0001F929><U+0001F929><U+0001F929> that means more Shazam’s and curiosity HEHEHHEHEHE"
"19152","@SPICinemas is Shazam running with english subs in Sathyam Cinemas(chennai)?"
"19153","i wish i could say shazam and i could have confidence to reassure my s/os with the love and affection i constantly crave to give them but am too scared to actually act on"
"19154","I know Shazam just came out and all but I hope DC does a Captain Thunder movie or uses him in an upcoming movie! (or has him in Shazam 2 XD)"
"19155","I saw #Shazam and let this be a warning....you don't need to! 

It was trying very hard to be Deadpool and failed miserably. The characters lacked depth &amp; the storyline had no complexity. 

The only saving grace? It was shot in Toronto &amp; so some places looked familiar."
"19156","I really wanna just go to the cinemas rn by myself and watch shazam but im lowkey scared to go alone aldjdjd"
"19157","@HenryGayden GREAT NEWS! Saw the movie today and LOVED it. Can't wait to see more. Each Shazam! sequel should just add and exclamation point to it's title.
Shazam!
Shazam!!
Shazam!!!"
"19158","I don’t think all Marvel have this problem but i have noticed some times they’ll try to have emotional beats in the film that haven’t been earned, then I watch Shazam which sets up and nails pretty much every emotional beat perfectly."
"19159","I really love the MCU fo the spectacle it is and they do give us wonderfully likable characters but whenever I watch Logan or a movie like Shazam I wish they tried to make movies like that."
"19160","@c_losg11 I liked aqua man, I loved captain marvel even tho I didn’t have high hopes for it. But if you think Shazam is good then maybe I’ll check it out."
"19161","@c_losg11 Yes I need to know ! Cause I wasnt gonna watch Shazam but if you mean it then I’ll probs watch it lol"
"19162","@vexedinthecity Have you ever read DC's Kingdom Come? I love how Shazam acted at the end. One of the GOAT comic series."
"19163","The person who i got to see shazam said they really enjoyed it and that makes my heart so happy. And all it took was one post lol"
"19164","Superb thread about what makes #Shazam so special. Eloquently put with a lot of heart <U+2764><U+FE0F>. Go see Shazam now, please. You will not regret it."
"19165","Yes. Yes we can"
"19166","I thought this Shazam movie everyone’s talking about was a remake of that Shaq movie. Turns out I don’t remember movie names very well"
"19167","I saw the movie and it sparked joy in me when kids just staryed shouting SHAZAM! after the film. Boys and girls doing it which means that they are the most relatable superheroes out there for them."
"19168","So here's what happened to the five-minute Godzilla: King of the Monsters footage shown in IMAX theaters before Shazam:"
"19169","Ive decided that I'm watching this every weekend til I'm sick of it dkdkdj"
"19170","@TheNelGOD That’s fair. I can appreciate both. I love Man of Steel, Shazam &amp; Wonder Woman while I also love First Avenger, Avengers &amp; Iron Man"
"19171","@edgarsallanhoe That’s literally me whenever I see the Shazam trailer <U+0001F602>"
"19172","this is NOT a marvel vs dc tweet i am not that type of person . im just trying to make shazam some extra coins ."
"19173","He called him ""Mr. The Rock"" 

This is why i love his ass, omg <U+0001F602>"
"19174","@iamsandrene @shannonfox *Shazam and Sivana land somewhere in the middle of Bucks County*"
"19175","@shannonfox Shazam has frequently been written where the way the transformation is handled is closer to, say, Thor taking over Donald Blake's body in those comics, as in he literally turns into a full-ass adult man and then back to a, um, how did Gail Simone put it? Adult in child drag."
"19176","@shannonfox Probably. I'm not sure that they'll do a comic adaptation, since this was pretty much the New 52 origin for Shazam."
"19177","I first discovered @ZacharyLevi from this movie too <U+0001F61D>"
"19178","Shazam was so fun. I’m enjoying DC movies more than Marvel lately and it’s fucking weird but <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"19179","@Spazkidin3d I'm glad Zack Snyder isn't part of the movie. The treatment for Shazam is what the future DC movies need"
"19180","@mrjafri @AmazonChique I totally agree with you. Also Ghostbusters had a higher budget than Shazam. I loved the Ghostbusters movie but would have made plot changes. I haven’t seen Shazam yet."
"19181","Amen to that!  #Shazam 

@ZacharyLevi"
"19182","Also, it's outright weird how much the marketing materials from SHAZAM! hide Djimon Hounsou. No publicity photos of him, he's only in the trailers as a silhouette or from behind. Like he's a non-presence."
"19183","@_MzlivieBaby_ Play the clip at the end when the song comes on and press the S shazam button and it'll come up and shazam."
"19184","@ThatPeterHayes @ZacharyLevi I loved the movie and Mark Strong did an excellet job as well. Love all the faces Levi made as Shazam being the tough guy look."
"19185","@ParkerMcCoy7 @NormaNikutowski @darrylballegeer @DDLomax @TenFlyingNinjas @HarlanDechamps @ginny_walker @kymwald @KarlHolton @LunaKayne @J_WebbGarrett @HMHwangWriter @bobby_kountz @seans_thoughts @Rek14684306 @red_bristol @ActorOnTheEdge @RowellPublish @JFkillsdarlings I haven't yet, but I did see Shazam, another DC movie, last week. I liked parts of it a lot, but it didn't feel as effortless a ""kid becomes superhero"" story as Spiderverse did. I'm rooting for the new DC movies though! I love their universe &amp; characters."
"19186","this dude really let his grandma fall down a flight of stairs <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"19187","Eerie, Shazam, Dumbo or Five Feet Apart...
I want to destress and watch a movie but I just couldnt decide which one. <U+0001F602>"
"19188","This tweet is in response to Shazam! btw"
"19189","@ScottMendelson @Forbes Sad that everyone has to go full Marvel to receive some appreciation. I mean I liked Shazam, but it was way too childish, especially the super dumb third act. People can't accept the masterpieces that Dawn of Justice and Man of Steel were"
"19190","Am I the only person that has picked up on @ponysmasher's nod to Justice League Mortal?! ANYBODY ELSE?! #SHAZAM"
"19191","Obviously."
"19192","Went and saw Shazam tonight with the sis as a birthday treat. Wasn't too bad of a movie tbh."
"19193","Okay so @ShazamMovie is my new favorite live action superhero movie. So many homages to the comics and a ton of fun."
"19194","Imagine a fan fiction story with Darla from the Shazam family, Monica from captain marvel as Monica Rambeau and Shuri as black panther. 

There I’ve put it into the universe! Anyone who writes fan fiction I need you!"
"19195","Shazam was a pleasant surprise; a superhero that is fun, witty, and charming against a villain who is menacing but understandable in what felt like a throwback to the best 90s adventure movies. Shockingly, DC may have finally turned the corner and started making decent films."
"19196","Excellent amazing thread about Shazam!"
"19197","Shazam was absolutely brilliant. Def one of my favorite superhero movies as I predicted."
"19198","@ZacharyLevi I am perfectly happy if DC moved you to be the face of the DCEU after seeing Shazam I know you could handle it great job and I can’t wait for the sequel also any word on some more chuck thanks hope you have a great day"
"19199","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie There are some bits that may be too scary for a six year old. It's actually darker than I thought it would be."
"19200","i will use shazam to find the name of any song regardless of where i am"
"19201","@Mickeysei34 i’m just glad you have shazam at five stars, even tho a certain someone tried to convince us that it was mediocre and dull and a pale imitation of homecoming"
"19202","Nigga really just dissed the masterpiece that is The Godfather I’m gonna have to do it to em"
"19203","Shazam is a straight 8 out of 10 really wasn’t that bad"
"19204","@mosiermadness @watertowermusic @ShazamMovie @benwallfisch @RupertGWilliams Been asking about the vinyl but no reply. The CD version of Aquaman has sold out and is now going for $150+ on eBay. Everyone I’ve asked has been silent. It’s really strange"
"19205","Tomorrow I'll take Mr. 10 to watch Captain Marvel. And on the weekend I plan to take Mr. 10 to watch Captain Marvel (Shazam!). 

How did we end up with a Captain Marvel on each universe? Surely DC should've given up on the name? 

I wonder if @GailSimone knows more about it."
"19206","@MrDalekJD Great comic book movie, amazing DC movie. Feel like they decided to take a less serious approach and just had fun with Shazam while still tying it to dark themes and future potential."
"19207","Thts a load of crap. Come up with a better excuse next time."
"19208","Okay so first of all they replaced the main character with a WOMAN which is not cool. Second, she doesn't say ""Shazam!"" even one time in the film. WTF. For some reason Lee Pace was a blue samurai, Jude Law made a good Black Adam though."
"19209","@ImperiousLex The funny thing is freddy shazam ed into a Asian guy. But I loved it."
"19210","Shazam so dirty telling kids to hold his staff and say his name kyaaaaaa"
"19211","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie Sensitive violence wise or emotions-wise? Violence is fairly cartoony, but some pretty painful stuff regarding parental abuse and abandonment. It’s super fun and empowering in many ways, but also has some difficult bits. That said we all LOVED it. My youngest is almost 9 tho."
"19212","Shazam is the best DC movie, do @ me, you fine people"
"19213","I feel so spoiled getting Captain Maeve and Shazam within a month of each other. It's the little Christmas that could."
"19214","Have never met @ZacharyLevi ,aside from a few Twitter exchanges, but chuffed with his success with Shazam! been a fan since Chuck ( one of my top ten shows) through to Mrs Maisel. Still stinging from not being cast as Sivana but dealing with it."
"19215","This whole thread. Exceptional."
"19216","Yooo shazam was one of the best DC movies ive ever fucking seen"
"19217","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie It’s really good, but not sure about this one. A few very violent fight scenes and tons of “jump out of your seat” moments."
"19218","OMGGGGG!! Imagine that!! <U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F><U+0001F44F>"
"19219","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie Zachary Levi did an awesome performance as Shazam tho"
"19220","@_PVRCinemas Done. 
Got a call for shazam too but never received any confirmation 
#Delhi"
"19221","@Bosco685 @Luiz_Fernando_J why is Shazam the seventh movie? is that coincidence ??"
"19222","I can confirm “Shazam” is really funny, charming and heartwarming. Definitely the best DC movie in years."
"19223","Probably a tie between Man of Steel and Shazam!  I am in the minority but I think Man of Steel is underrated and a very solid solo film"
"19224","who wants to read my #Shazam review?"
"19225","@nam3user @emiliaheards @Iokified 01. She's the foster mom of Shazam family. 

02. SS didn't had any 'Mother' scenes at all."
"19226","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie Some cussing - super hero violence- 6 may be a bit young"
"19227","Oh Shazam.... smh.  I've completely outgrown basic ass, lazy ass, paint by numbers, filmmaking. I wouldnt even call it filmmaking... marvelized flickmaking.  Thank god for the upcoming JOKER FILM."
"19228","Favorite part of #Shazam was the #HADOUKEN"
"19229","Shazam is a sweet, good movie, and Gail Simone has a lot of smart stuff to say about it.

My kid loved Shazam. It scared him, excited him, and made him laugh. Go see it if the internet hasn’t fully poisoned your heart."

One of the funniest, most wholesome, most endearing, and downright entertaining comic book movies I have ever seen."
"19238","There’s a few times a year I come home and feel an immense sense of gratitude for being alive, and I can honestly say today is one of those days after taking my students to see @ShazamMovie"
"19239","I need to watch it again"
"19240","Totally wish I could just yell #Shazam and be a superhero!"
"19241","I need some sort of psychic equivalent of Shazam to tell me how song got into my head. Right now it is Edge of Heaven by Wham (which I had to google as I didn't know the name of it) but when I woke up an hour ago it was 'One Horse Town' from By The Light of the Silvery Moon."
"19242","@ImAaronJ How many times are you planning to re-watch SHAZAM!?!"
"19243","@alwaysmallville Watching Shazam, I was all, ‘wow John Glover once again plays a dick of a father to a bald villain’. You have to wonder if that was intentional casting."
"19244","@LaurenNakaoWinn John Glover was in Shazam and because some things never change, he was playing a colossal dick of a father to a bald villain. Lol"
"19245","I got #SHAZAM! Which works, cause I really wanna go see #ShazamMovie."
"19246","@ZacharyLevi hoping Shazam will have a sequel <U+0001F440> it’s really good! I watched last Friday. Super intrigued! Great work!!!!!"
"19247","wow lemme just say shazam is way better than it has any right to be

reminds me of the 2004 hellboy"
"19248","Finally saw Shazam.  Loved it.  It even had tonnes of background references to the comics to fill it out."
"19249","This is gold"
"19250","@liz_abdl Nah that means I watched The Shazam movie xD"
"19251","For those saying the $53 million opening weekend for #Shazam isn’t a win, you should know the production budget was $98 million. It just earned back half of its production budget in one weekend. The film is doing fine."
"19252","@BBMAs why did i think about the beginning of the movie ‘shazam’ eye-"
"19253","Shazam! This is the movie that DC needed. It’s a step in the right direction for the entire DC Cinematic Universe. DC picked the proper tone for a character like Billy Batson. It’s fun, humorous, and an overall great origin story. Say his name. Let his power run through you

"19265","@TimGe0rge It made it to Shazam!"
"19266","@dancefloorkween right. i would’ve liked for the 3/4 of the movie to be less idk empty? but it built up to a satisfying end. i liked it tho, not Shazam’s clean shaved beard tho he looked kinda??? Superficial"
"19267","Rotten tomato fresh rating

Captain Marvel: 31%
Shazam: 93%

The OG wins <U+0001F62C>"
"19268","I still think Terry Crews would be the perfect Mr. Tawky-Tawny. In an actual tiger suit. No CGI."
"19269","Sooooo if Shazam has the wisdom of Solomon, why does he act like an idiot for half of the film? <U+0001F914>"
"19270","There were surprises? Apart from the one thing that wasn’t in trailers but was spoiled by the widely available kids’ toys?

The more distance I get from Shazam the less I think I liked it. Needs to get way crazier in a sequel. Lean ALL THE WAY IN, WB."
"19271","Shazam 2 needs -

Mr Mind in full effect
Talky Tawny 
Uncle Marvel
The Rock of Eternity (named)
Sivana as mad scientist, not Black Adam stand-in
Magic out the wing wang
and a Superman with a head"
"19272","I hate when I’m trying to Shazam a song on a set and this trick hits me with 3-4 different tracks every time I check to make sure it’s the actual song lol"
"19273","Brandon- “if I had Shazam’s powers, I wouldn’t fight the crime....I’d be the crime”"
"19274","Shazam: 6.5/10 there’s to much comedy and not enough action for my taste"
"19275","Ummm hi <U+0001F44B> excuse me @zaralarsson I just heard <U+0001F5E3> a snippet of your new song with @marshmellomusic and I @Shazam ‘ed that bitch because it was <U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525> only to <U+0001F480><U+0001F480><U+0001F480> finding out it’s coming soon from you two!!! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>"

"19278","What reality you living in if you think Spider-Man Homecoming and Shazam! Are the same movie.. The reach lol"
"19279","Folks boycotting Shazam are crackheads"
"19280","@ZacharyLevi Saw #ShazamMovie over the weekend- such a blast! So great to hear the whole theater laughing! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F606>"
"19281","@JChurchRadio I definitely remember Sinbad the comic. Shazam was a white kid with a weird guy in a trailer."
"19282","Oh wow they're moving with the speed of Mercury on this one. I wonder what they'll release first - Black Adam or the Shazam sequel."
"19283","Speaking of, I really should get around to watching Shazam soon..."
"19284","I saw #Shazam last night and loved it and plan to see it again. It occurred to me then that the last movie I saw in the theater twice was Tangled, which also starred @ZacharyLevi ."
"19285","Just saw #Shazam and #PetSematary back to back. Shazam was fun, but not as good as people were making it out to be (and as I was HOPING it would be since the first trailer at comic con last year). Pet Sematary was awesome! And I have ABSOLUTELY no idea why people are bashing it."
"19286","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie I think he would be fine. Great movie."
"19287","This is all true for me. Shazam! is a great movie. He's been one of my favorites since the 70's on Saturday morning."
"19288","Hell yes, this is great news."
"19289","From the proverbial belly of the whale, the hero goes up and realizes what needs to be done. Despite the pain he was feeling, he was ready to face the monster. That's the stuff of real heroes.

Again, thank you @ponysmasher @ShazamMovie @HenryGayden This DC fan is over the moon."
"19290","People are probably tired of me blabbing about #Shazam, but I don't care. It's a great movie and I just have one more thing to say about it (okay, maybe this is a lie. I could go on forever) w/o spoiling anything.

That scene at the apartment, when Billy finally learned the truth"
"19291","Shazam was amazing, @ZacharyLevi you are amazing, and you talking about mental health is even more amazing! Proud fan<U+0001F64B><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"19292","Just saw @ShazamMovie and it was everything I wanted it to be and more! Thank you @ZacharyLevi"
"19293","Thanks to @ZacharyLevi and @ponysmasher for making Shazam! Took my 3 girls to it and it’s the first superhero movie they loved. Finally!! Thank you!"
"19294","Thread. Spoilers. This is why I appreciate @GailSimone!!"
"19295","#F2B #F2Bq @JChurchRadio
Billy batson, who was disabled used to say the magic word Shazam to become Captain Marvel."
"19296","@JChurchRadio Wait. The Sinbad genie movie doesn’t exist?? ... Also, how do you not know about Shazam! ??! Billy Batson? Riding around in a motor home with an old dude fighting crime? #f2b"
"19297","@Nadeshot u gotta kick out marvel cause that shit overrated and nikkas finally seein the light cause of shazam aquaman n wonder woman, dc more deep marvel just silliness"
"19298","I Shazam more than I’d like to admit :/"
"19299","So Shazam was... Okay. When I own it I'll give it a proper rating."
"19300","Robust???????????<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F923><U+0001F923> Critics and bloggers are trying hard to convince people to blv #shazam is a hit. But, its not."
"19301","A great double feature that would be"
"19302","If this is true I congratulate @ponysmasher, @ZacharyLevi, @AsherAngel, @jackdgrazer and all the crew and cast! #ZacharyLevi, your humanity, sheer and very apparent love for life, and the talent of everybody are paying off! I'm so glad these characters are in such good hands! <U+0001F64F>"
"19303","@ZacharyLevi SHAZAM was everything and more! The only movie EVER that my kids insisted wr go back and watch again as soon ad it ended!Can't wait for the next one!Congratulations on an awesome job !!!"
"19304","@FrostLion100 If someone wants to do that, let them. Personally, I didn’t like Shazam when I left the theatre but I woke up the next day and wanted to watch it again (to be fair I was in a good mood, like, I-wanted-to-watch-aquaman-again type of good mood)"
"19305","My best friend would the power to shapeshift, so he could become anything he wants!"
"19306","Also for a movie w/Paul Rudd it was not as funny and this movie did not have anywhere near the amount of humor I went in expecting. Maybe that is unfair of me to assume or typecast Rudd. Or maybe Shazam has just thrown my expectations out of whack lol"
"19307","Saw Shazam. Wouldn’t recommend it."
"19308","@ZacharyLevi being that I am a hot blooded heterosexual guy. After watching Shazam at the weekend I now have a slight man crush on Mr Levi. Is it wrong if so it’s too late !!!  #shazam was epic !!"
"19309","Ok, but does Supes make an appearance in Shazam? No wait, dont tell me. I'm seeing it tomorrow."
"19310","Finally, DC gets it right. Managed to catch #Shazam. I had a blast. Has the heart and humour. Great casting and direction. It's <U+0001F345><U+0001F345><U+0001F345><U+0001F345> fresh @RottenTomatoes for me."
"19311","@ponysmasher did I spy the IDS Center from Minneapolis in #Shazam - 

This Minneapolis resident loves seeing the city on the big screen.  It films so well! (PS - seeing the movie a 2nd time tomorrow, it’s just too good to see once!)"
"19312","@Mister_BatfIeck Sivana would hold Freddy hostage. “If you love these people so much, you can mourn for them.” Shazam would twist Sivana’s neck and scream in agony. 

Philly would also be half the city it is now. And those bullies definitely wouldn’t have been saved."
"19313","@ShazamMovie I will watch this movie Tommorow."
"19314","SPOILER #Shazam 
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

the scientist lady who works for Dr Sivana, though. she's been haunted with ghosts, and now she dies in Shazam. poor lady."
"19315","Reading people's feedbacks about the surprises in #Shazam makes me really glad they didn't add anything new in the official trailer. I love that they didn't listen to people; they didn't show most of the good stuff in it. Watching them in the big screen is definitely way better."
"19316","Ok so #Shazam stands for Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury.

But instead of Shazam, what if his name is, consider this: Wsspcs."
"19317","Both are really good heroes, I'll be seeing Shazam soon, and I couldn't choose, and Captain Marvel was so awesome!"
"19318","See Shazam and I’m really glad I did! I can’t remember the last time I laughed as hard as I did. This was truly a role that seemed like it was created just for you.

Thank you for being the superhero we all deserve <U+0001F44F>"
"19319","when can oomf and i be 21 so we can drink while watching john wick 3 <U+0001F629>"
"19320","@chalametsdc Shazam is the kind of movie I'd want to see with my friends since I personally don't take it too seriously, but seeing any movie solo is a power move anyway"
"19321","Not only was @ShazamMovie terrific, but seeing all of @ZacharyLevi ‘s personalized, heartfelt responses to fans via twitter really speaks volumes to awesome he really is! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"
"19322","@marcbernardin @AmazonChique Forget narratives. The reality is that #Shazam was a hit after its opening weekend and GHOSTBUSTERS wasn’t, simply because of their budgets. It’s about all the numbers. Narratives didn’t matter when CAPTAIN MARVEL cracked $1 billion."
"19323","Note: Sandberg said it was more because THEY had only the one day to use the school, and had to rush through the cameo.

Still, the important point: As far as Sandberg, and Mouth Foot Safran, and therefore Hamada and Lee are concerned...

#HenryCavillIsOurSuperman 
#DeusVult"
"19324","Saw Shazam last night and it’s honestly a really well played out movie."
"19325","If Shazam will just start showing now, that would be great. Copped my tickets from last week :/"
"19326","Shazam was probably the least I’ve ever cared about a super hero movie ever coming out . Just give me Avengers End Game already <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FD>"
"19327","I thought y’all were playing about the cover art<U+0001F643>"
"19328","@ZacharyLevi Everytime I get a twitter notification its usually a response from you to a fans tweet. Just tell your thumbs its your hearts fault. It's great to see the love and support. Congrats on #SHAZAM. I'll be seeing it this weekend."
"19329","Shazam is the best DC superhero"
"19330","if y’all haven’t seen #Shazam than you’re missing out. <U+0001F640><U+0001F640>"
"19331","And now, I'm looking at the numbers for the Shazam not-review. Despite being about me explicitly choosing to not review a movie, it has more than triple the number of clicks my actual reviews have gotten over the last few months."
"19332","So yeah, you guys, Shazam! was a total joy. Highly recommend it for all ages - well, maybe six and up. Anyway, it was great. <U+0001F600>"
"19333","Actually 2 and 3 are actually probably interchangeable for me, the first Avengers is still amazing and I have a feeling i'm suffering from recent-cy bias for Shazam!"
"19334","@Mysteviegee @ComicsintheGA @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi @AsherAngel @ponysmasher Thanks!! :)"
"19335","Shazam May be one of the few movies I go see again, I can’t get over @ZacharyLevi ‘s wonderful performance! Truly talented guy, no joke, see #Shazam ! The whole cast was wonderful, Jokes were great, it was such a fun time."
"19336","My official review of #Shazam is this: Hey @ZacharyLevi are those space pants?"
"19337","It was incredibly inspiring watching Shazam fight a slightly less evil Jeff Bezos."
"19338","I’m probably going to go see Shazam tomorrow because I doubt it’ll be worth anymore than $5"
"19339","Wow Shazam was great fun. Reminded me of Homecoming with how it scaled down the super hero epic into a more personal story with solid comedy."
"19340","@riotwomennn But we also need to factor in that Biden is as old as Shazam, and factor in years as a Senator with the number of substantive accomplishments."
"19341","I thought #Shazam was a fun movie. I’d give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. Some parts were a little cheesy but it’s about a kid that becomes a superhero. Can’t expect it to have no cheese."
"19342","Love this to the max. Keep inspiring Shazam! @ZacharyLevi"
"19343","Shazam! Was actually pretty good. Last 20 minutes was... lame, but everything else was really fun. 7/10 #Shazam"
"19344","@Shazam is such a great app! It’s such a cool and impressive feat of technology. It’s free, easy to use, and works so fast! What a great idea, there had been so many times in the past I’ve wanted to know a song title/artist and was unable to. Now I can! #Wheatonfmns"
"19345","A good Shazam appreciation thread"
"19346","So, having a conversation on Discord about how the Marvel Family (Shazam version) is basically a Sentai team. 

I don't like it when Mr. Mind metamorphoses into a giant monster in comics, but it could maybe work if they went full Toku/Power Rangers with it."
"19347","Shazam clear version is out for download,  you are welcome"
"19348","Urm,  not all that clear but will do <U+0001F612>"
"19349","@ShanJeniah Definitely recommend. The 40s stories were great kid comics that hold up well. Even if Billy Batson met the wizard Shazam by following a total stranger into an abandoned subway station. His current comic origin omits that (of which I approve)."
"19350","@slines @Shazam This has always been a favorite of mine."
"19351","those liars"
"19352","I was in Los Angeles over the weekend, which presented me the opportunity for the ultimate double feature: #SHAZAM, followed by #HighLife. 

Would 100% recommend, folks."
"19353","Shazam! Turns out to be good and now people are talking crazy..."
"19354","And their films suffer bc of it. The way the film line up for the dceu should've been 
Man Of Steel 
A solo batman film
Wonder Woman 
Batman vs Superman: dawn of justice 
Aquaman 
The Flash 
Justice League
Suicide Squad
Shazam 

Etc"
"19355","all ive done all day is watch shazam interviews. ive concluded that i am in love with Zachary Levi"
"19356","Yes. All of this. Especially the Darla part. Go see Shazam, please!"
"19357","highkey mad bc sm taytay onli has shazam in 3D, like there is no way im paying more for shitty quality"
"19358","@SamParkerMetal Btw, have any of you guys noticed (especially when it comes to YouTube reviews) how most positive reviews of Shazam include a 5 minute tirade in how much they hate the DCEU before showering Shazam with praise? It’s if they can’t compliment the movie without insulting the others"
"19359","@HeyMcDermott I confess, I don't know Shazam. But I support supporting kids' passions wholeheartedly. =D"
"19360","loved the part of #ShazamMovie when Jimmy Fallon &amp; Steve Carrell are fighting mid-air. really cool to see Stanley Tucci playing a villain role and also Jimmy Fallon just absolutely jacked in the movie #Shazam, which Jimmy Fallon is definitely in"
"19361","Were the bullies in shazam a couple or brothers?"
"19362","i will be there on the opening night."
"19363","@AmazonChique Finally, GB16 had a mid-July release date, normally a time for blockbusters and higher box office numbers. Shazam is the 12th highest opening weekend of an April release of all time. GB16 is the 67th highest July opening weekend of all time. Both adjusted for inflation."
"19364","I’m so happy Shazam! highlighted loving foster homes. Also refreshing to see parents who understand that reactive attachment issues are real."
"19365","Shazam DID NOT give us one of the most diverse superhero casts ever for y’all to not hype it up and see it. Fake ass hoes."
"19366","Just saw @ZacharyLevi on Shazam and he’s still the most precious thing I’ve ever seen. <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+26A1><U+FE0F> Billy Batson is Intersect 5.0 with lasers."
"19367","I saw Shazam

It's probably the ""best"" DC Movie, but I like Wonder Woman a little better. Wonder Woman is more uneven, but it's highs are higher, whereas Shazam is more consistently good

Reminds me a bit of a 80s movie"
"19368","@comicsexplained I got to thinking, since the Rob Corps already has a Green Lantern Corps inspired oath, is there also a Rob Corps equivalent for Shazam?"
"19369","@kirkneverdied Best: Captain Marvel and Us
Worst: Alita and Shazam!

Both of my worst aren’t terrible...I just wanted more from them."
"19370","@Kaiwhitmann @KuavoKenny @Nadeshot Dceu ones are but nah I enjoyed ww aquaman and shazam"
"19371","Great perspective here."
"19372","Honestly been doing extra theater checks at work just so I can watch @ZacharyLevi in Shazam I won’t lie. I think it’s definitely time to do some overtime this week"
"19373","reasons to see shazam:
- comedy
- diverse cast
- pop culture references/cameos
- zachary levi 
- better captain marvel"
"19374","Loved it!!!!"
"19375","Ok this is in no way a spoiler but Shazam was literally a film about a bright shiny superhero pounding the snot out of grimdark MillerSnyder shit"
"19376","@MarchHareInJune @GianncarloI @ojichan72 @Rob_readscomics @CharlesOfShred @Snapple2Apple @RicoReadsComics @MrNoFollowers @CaptainBacon61 @marsanj47 @ComicsFred @marvel_mmo @grelan @jared_webb1 @MrNiceGuy18_58 @CanadaDaredevil @Nerdgrounds @NerdgroundsBRG @cosmicblackdude @MakeMineAmalgam Captain Marvel/SHAZAM. If The Monster has no name, at least you can rationalize it taking the name of its creator. Flipping Captain Marvel's name after 7 decades its just silly!"
"19377","i wanna see shazam but wish I could see it with my sister :(

Shazam is a good baby"
"19378","@snakelesbians I love Shazam, thanks to Young Justice - and while I'm not super into comics the ones I've read with him in it are very good. So very excited to see it!"
"19379","@ShazamMovie is everything @DCComics and @wbpictures needed to do with #Superman with a bit less shadow. 

All DCU films seem so dark and confined so far."
"19380","@KuavoKenny @Attach @Nadeshot Shazam and Aquaman were fire"
"19381","@otfjerryy @KuavoKenny @Attach @Nadeshot MoS, Watchmen, WW, Aquaman, and Shazam are straight heat"
"19382","The more I read Black Adam (Johns' Shazam, 52) the less I find myself imagining Dwayne Johnson as him based on his previous roles including dudebro action movies and comedies and everything in between I don't think he can pull it off but I hope he can prove me wrong."
"19383","This thread made me cry, such a wonderful review of #Shazam!!"
"19384","Even though I love #Shazam better than #CaptainMarvel, I will NOT use it as an excuse to bash the latter. Especially because they're both completely different movies from completely different companies."
"19385","I love that #shazam. Whole shit reminded me of some voodoo reality<U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FE>"
"19386","But Shazam never really takes itself seriously and puts comedy first. 

Whereas Marvel films try to put adventure/action first and then spoil serious scenes with dumb comedy. It’s not organic."
"19387","@SamParkerMetal @SupesBatsy You realise The Flash or Man of Steel 2 could be trash? They have the homecoming writers for Flash and Superman has been turned into a joke in JL/Shazam Cameo. They threw away the Zimmer score and they could give us another Superman Returns."
"19388","Dr Sivana kills the foster parents kidnaps the family and gives each of them a deadly sin. Shazam must fight his family and Dr Sivana Then try turn them back and into the #SHAZAM family. Superman also gets involved to help #SHAZAM <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"19389","Gonna watch Shazam. My younger brother came to visit because his exams are over... Can't hang with him until May when my exams are done."
"19390","@theskybandit The thing is Shazam spoilers were posted even before movie was released, which was petty.
And their justification was ""we were discussing ridiculous decision by wb""."
"19391","captain marvel         shazam

"19394","Just enjoyed @ShazamMovie One of the best superhero movies I've watched in a while. #CaptianMarvel and #endgame next."
"19395","it sure would be nice if people could just talk about shazam on it's own merits instead of trying to say how much better or worse it is than captain marvel <U+0001F644> they're different movies. the only similarities the two characters have is their name."
"19396","No matter how family/friend type of movie it is, for me,
Watching films alone&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with others"
"19397","Shazam looks like a movie I'd enjoy but I'm done with superheroes and DC can eat a dick."
"19398","Guess technically there will be a Shazam! Trilogy 
#Shazam 
#BlackAdam 
#Shazam2"
"19399","Shazam is technically a Christmas movie! 
Change my mind (you can’t) 
#Shazam"
"19400","The highest praise I can give for #shazam is that it makes me sad knowing that marvel movies won’t be able to break the mold they cast for themselves. It was nice going into a superhero “universe” movie and not knowing fully what to expect from it."
"19401","@ZacharyLevi I’m so proud of you and @ShazamMovie!!! congrats to you, the cast and the crew for an amazing work!"
"19402","@sinjitsu_itiro Anyway, hope you enjoy Shazam! I can best describe it as “fun.” Nothing more, nothing too deep."
"19403","@Rudy91101827 @DannySmithRFLZ @BurnN8or101 At the end of the day, studios are in the business to make money.  Shazam might be more enjoyable to you and others but in order to  make over a billion you need repeat business.  That being said more people will enjoy Captain Marvel."

"19410","hooooly crap,shazam is so damn good! so full of love and care for its characters,so conscious(And proud!) of its origins,using this fairly absurd set up to tell a story about hurt children and how the difference b/t a life of happyness and misery can be the family you adopt"
"19411","The Godzilla trailer played before Shazam and...oh man is that movie gonna be a movie"

"19420","@TheCollector198 Real close? IT IS def. one w/ the Snyderverse. Wonder Woman is EASILY the second or third best of the DCEU.

MoS and BvS battle it out for me at the #1 spot all the time.

As far as Aquaman and Shazam, I enjoyed them both but Wonder Woman is QUEEN!"

"19426","@AngryJoeShow Seeing as they came up with the joke where Shazam couldn't hear the villain which made me laugh more than a straight up. Comedy has in years, this is very good news!"
"19427","No, ""Shazam!"" is just what he says. The character's name is Gomer Pyle."
"19428","Saw Shazam tonight.  The movie.  Not the guy."
"19429","Shazam was really good considering it was made by DC"
"19430","#Shazam was an absolute delight!
Best superhero movie I've seen in a long time. (And a really great portrayal of the *original* Captain Marvel <U+0001F440>)"
"19431","Hello @wbpictures @DCComics this is just a friendly reminder that we’d like you to keep Henry Cavill as Superman. Thank you.

"19435","@thejamessnyder @ShazamMovie If he's sensitive, pass. Maybe at home on a small screen with lights on. It's mostly a light, sweet film, but the bad guys are pretty dark and there is one scene in particular that's... harsh. No blood, but violent monsters. Def worse than Bumblebee.

Or just skip that bad scene!"
"19436","Shazam must really be lit cause it got a legit buzz in the middle of Thrones &amp; End game season <U+0001F914>"

"19444","@ZacharyLevi just wanted to thank you and all the team for the great experience that was the Shazam movie. My daughter is still running screaming Shazam! After watching it. We saw it the weekend and she went to school today as a champion."

"19451","Bruh. Shazam. SHAZAM!!! I have always loved DC more than Marvel and they haven't been given a decent movie since the 80s. But then along comes Shazam... I am so happy, this movie did justice to my fandom. Go see Billy Batson kick butt.
@ZacharyLevi thank you!"

   SHAZAM"
"19454","But I was wrong and we went to go see SHAZAM! Earlier than anticipated so we watched the movie and it was pretty great.

I'm now interested in the DCEU or DC films"

"19461","Can't wait to see #Shazam and @ZacharyLevi as a goofy superhero, I keep hearing great things! Can't get to the theater so I hope it's available to buy soon."
"19462","@MoshWithTyler let’s pirate Shazam and watch it. Seems like the only logical option."

"19473","If this is your first CB and are feeling overwhelmed, please dont be. Enjoy this moment. New music &amp; new era are so exciting! If your not sure what to do, just do three things: purchase, stream and shazam. If you're not sure how, just ask! #BTSARMY is one big family! @BTS_twt"

"19494","#Shazam is legit.  Fun.  The Hero's Quest.  What a superhero movie can be."
"19495","Shazam! is another example of a movie that never really sold me with the marketing but it is indeed a very good movie! Perhaps these DC movies have some fight left in them."
"19496","@Shubham32173002 @Mister_BatfIeck Also Freddy basically told him that he was hiding behind Shazam so that he wouldn't have to face his problems and even Billy admitted that in the second act, I really don't know how you expected this narrative to fit and be good in the movie."
"19497","mdbranch ZacharyLevi That would be funny but it’s the wrong universe. Shazam is Dc so he only referenced other DC characters"
"19498","@dedicated_bts @Mattel @ShazamMovie Ahem you have nail polish remover, acrylic paint and so on"
"19499","I just got out from watching #Shazam, and holy cow, DC hit it way out of the park now!"
"19500","Anyway I’m off to see Shazam"
"19501","I had no idea they'd make a successful movie about the word I scream when I'm about to cum. Thanks for making things awkward, Shazam."
"19502","Shazam! ! sequel in the works, Henry Gayden will return as Writer #Shazam"
"19503","@beasasira I’ve seen people say that Shazam was a better Superman than Superman. Really? The same Shazam that used his own powers for his own self-interest? The Shazam that used his powers to get money? REALLY?????????"
"19504","@colinmochrie @ZacharyLevi I gotta say Colin I'm now imagining ""you"" yes ""U"" as Shazam<U+26A1> You in that suit. Oh man. I would go to that movie!! <U+0001F605><U+0001F605>"
"19505","did shazam already come out? i don't keep up with other movies besides marvel obviously"
"19506","it came out around a week ago here in sg, its really good. There was a moment in the third arc which i shall not spoil that left me in awe, especially since I read some of the comics. 

You’ll enjoy it"
"19507","People saying Shazam was great, and I was gonna go see it.

But I saw that it has flossing in it and so I am going to just go watch Ratatouille again for a much more enjoyable experience."
"19508","Me and Noel just watched Shazam and are now watching the new pet sematary <U+0001F62C> let’s see if it’s as good as the original"
"19509","Welp seen @ShazamMovie twice in 2 days. @ZacharyLevi you killed it and this is coming from a marvel girl!"
"19510","@nachosarah @SamSykesSwears You two should see Shazam, it is funny and has demons. So, like two birds"

"19513","I went to see @ShazamMovie tonight and @ZacharyLevi was just fantastic. One really nice surprise was Cooper Andews @smugorange who just keeps showing up in great rolls. First @Den_Of_Thieves now Shazam. Shazam is full of heart, butt kicking fun, and great laughs. #Superize"

"19516","@GailSimone loved everything you wrote about #SHAZAM!!! Saw the movie twice since it's been in theaters, that is how much I loved it. Ever since I was a kid, Captain Marvel has been one of my favorite because that possibility of saying the word...it sticks with a kid.  1/5"

"19520","I wish I can review Shazam but someone has issues with the way I use to meme about my reviews but let’s just say it’s worth the 15+ dollars."
"19521","@MaxPrimeReviews @ZacharyLevi @ShazamMovie @wbpictures @AsherAngel Dude, just got out of my screening and if all DC movies can start being this good all the time, I'd be pretty happy with that. Doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, not the grim dark Snyder-verse and they actually did the whole *SPOILER redacted* I loved it! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"19522","gonna treat my fam later to watch #Shazam !!! it's my first time to treat them to the theaters since i got employed so im rly rly rly happy!!!!!! and excited!!!!"
"19523","Shazam was cool. Not enough action though. Started to feel like a Disney original a few times too."
"19524","Awesome news. 
Congrats to Henry Gayden!
Well-deserved.

How much did Darren Lemke contribute to the writing process?!
#Shazam #DC"
"19525","@bertkreischer It’s called sing it to Shazam"
"19526","Seeing @Handlebrody in Shazam was probably the biggest highlight of the movie for me"
"19527","slow hands in shazam is the best use of any song in any movie ever"
"19528","@TalkinSnikt Me and @CruisinwithCruz just had this convo with as good as shazam was DC has no excuse for an over the top lantern movie."
"19529","I heard really good things about Shazam and I really really wanna watch it"
"19530","Shazam is absolutely wonderful. 
Just completely, entirely, joyously wonderful. #shazam"
"19531","I've spent so much on movies already and I wanna go see Shazam"
"19532","Nicki Minaj actually kept the secret way more hidden. It was pretty obvious with all the hints Halsey was dropping. The only way we found out about Nicki’s was shazam So Nicki wine with this one"
"19533","@MrBolty Couldn’t agree more. He seems like a cautionary about the mistreatment of children and how most people just write off troublesome kids as doomed to be horrible people. The only real difference between Sivana and Shazam is that Billy actually has a family willing to love him."
"19534","So excited to see @TheRock Black Adam Movie when it happens, then we can see him face his greatest challenge and The Wizards other Champion SHAZAM!"
"19535","Finally saw shazam but I’m confused why one of the trailers was an old Infinity War one lol"
"19536","I'm so glad that I didn't see any #Shazam spoilers. Third act is great, go see the movie, DM me for further conversation because I'm going to continue not spoiling a great film."
"19537","@iemcanadian @AS25x__ Shazam simply failed to deliver his true potential."
"19538","Y'all keep streaming KTL on spotify,apple music also dont forget to shazam

#KillThisLove"
"19539","Just saw Shazam! and one of the things I loved about it is that it was NOTHING like the movie I was expecting it to be. All I'm going to say is that Shazam is possibly the best comic book film since The Dark Knight and you should go see it right now."
"19540","@bitchdujour I missed it all! We were at Shazam <U+0001F602> I was surprised by the final after such a slow start but then read it went to OT. Now I’m sorry I missed it. No direct ties to either school though. Enjoy your celebration! <U+0001F389>"
"19541","The accuracy of this tweet"
"19542","Shazam is a really really good movie"
"19543","Shazam was great. Everyone seems to be comparing it to Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, and I totally agree. SUPER fun. 

I'm not a huge superhero guy, despite having seen almost all of these movies because of @GraveHorizon But this one stuck out to me as one of the best in awhile."
"19544","@IvyDoomkitty @ElPasoComicCon With Shazam out in theatres now, I say Zatanna, and Endgame out soon, I would say wear either Mantis or Mary Jane Spidey."
"19545","Wow, @ShazamMovie was good! I actually want to see it again!"
"19546","@AmazonChique Yes, Ghostbusters was, with a $150 million production budget, approximately $60 million more expensive than Shazam. But that's somewhat negligible — in a world where the average franchise flick costs upwards of $200 million to make and market, they're both bargains."
"19547","@AngryJoeShow Joe, after seeing Shazam today, I'm loving your re ratings of all DCEU films, fantastic watch and discussions with ur mates, any chance of a Marvel video now??? <U+0001F601><U+0001F601>"
"19548","Oh my god the hot asianguy from 13 reasons why is in Shazam."
"19549","Sooo I’m riding in the car with my friend and “Season Me Up - @TheSwollenOne” comes on. I look to my right and she’s trying to Shazam the song <U+0001F602><U+0001F605>"
"19550","A friend said that Shazam was too cheesy and that he liked when DC was more serious

It's the same friend who said that The Thing and Alien were boring and that the Raimi Spider-man films are campy and bad so I don't trust him when it comes to movies"
"19551","Agreed about the fact that this movie was so fulfilling that you didn't need anything more after the final scene. It was perfect and satisfying. They checked all the boxes. Such an amazing watch!"
"19552","My girlfriend is 22 and she just pulled out her phone to shazam ""Best I Ever Had"" by Drake <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"19553","So Shazam was great! And now I totally want to cosplay him"
"19554","@truthlovefaith In fairness, Shazam &amp; Billy were never really 'the same person'. Shazam has almost always been portrayed as the Superman, to Billy's Clark Kent/Jimmy Olsen hybrid. To it's credit, Shazam! attempts to align them more closely, in a Tom Hanks' Big sorta way."
"19555","@ZacharyLevi That was honestly the sweetest damned thing to do. And she's right, you frickin' rocked #Shazam - I've never howled so much in a movie theatre and I would do it a 100 times more!"
"19556","I prob won’t watch Shazam bc I don’t care for Zach Levi but ppl be reaching"
"19557","@slcmof Shazam sequal was actually just confirmed to be happening"
"19558","i’m mad i paid 12 of my good dollars, wasted 2 good hours out of my life, all to watch shazam....."
"19559","Honestly out of the solos.... it might be Shazam. I love it so much. I haven’t felt that happy watching a superhero movie in a while. I love them all though."

"19562","Just finished watching Shazam it’s probably my favorite dc movie I have seen in awhile but I still wouldn’t recommend it but it did have its moments overall I woul give it a 5 or 6 out of 10"
"19563","Can y'all just let disabled viewers talk about how they feel (negative/positive) about shazam without putting them down jfc. You hail the """"representation"""" in the film but shut down the people this is supposed to represent? Fake"
"19564","@Cfreckles2 to read minds !"
"19565","I can confirm that WW is x10 better than both Aquaman and Shazam"
"19566","Just saw Shazam, it was good. A lot of funny moment, but never felt inappropriate. There were some moments that were a little too dark, in fact a kid was crying and had to leave. But over all it was a good time."
"19567","@johncampea Imo. Shazam looks &amp; feels like a stand alone movie. Nothing about its marketing made it feel like part of DC universe. Stand alone films don’t have 100 mil openings or top a bil. They should have played up dceu connections more. Would have helped"
"19568","Our local drive in theatre (yes we have one) is playing a double feature of #Shazam and #CaptainMarvel and I have no idea how to feel about that

<U+0001F914><U+0001F609>"
"19569","This thread is wonderful <U+0001F606>"
"19570","@The_BUD_Guy @Nadeshot Wonder Woman was great, Aquaman was good but dragged on and Batman vs Superman was trash and I've yet to see Shazam"
"19571","To put it another way, it cost $90 million to make Shazam! and it just made over $200 million its first week. Even if we assume a marketing budget of $45 million (which I don't think it had) It's already made a profit for DC and with almost no well known characters or stars."
"19572","@ZacharyLevi I hear #Shazam 2 is going to be epic.....  Just sending  it to the universe"
"19573","Watched Shazam! today. Such an amazing film with an amazing cast like @smugorange, @ZacharyLevi and more. Review coming soon!"
"19574","@anj_best @Mattel @ShazamMovie But I don’t have the talent to put those things to use"
"19575","I’m just going through #Chuck for the first time now and after watching #Shazam I’ve realised I’m a huge @ZacharyLevi fan and it’s so cool to see how his career has progressed. Shazam might be favourite DCCU movie and I can’t wait for the sequel!"

"19580","Do not let the goofy dancing fool you, Shazam is a good movie"
"19581","@ZacharyLevi congrats on the opening weekend. Learned of you from Chuck and had a blast at your awesome nerdhq parties. I took my immediate family, my cousins and their kids, and a few friends (15 in total) to the movies this weekend and everyone had a blast! Nicely done #Shazam"
"19582","@Angels My 14yo is dying to find the name of a song you played between either the 2nd or 3rd inning at the stadium tonight (4/8). Any chance you keep a record of that? I couldn’t Shazam it in time."
"19583","@stargazer0118 It’s stupid , it’s the same for ppl who want Black Adam movie to be bloody when it’s going to connect to Shazam that ain’t happening , this why they will probably include the JSA to tone down the things &amp; change a little bit in the origin story"
"19584","Good morning @BTS_twt are getting all that radio promo so all we have to do is stream and buy and Shazam. Stay motivated we are doing amazing"

"19590","Really, really enjoyed Shazam. Who would have thought that all the DC movies were missing was some heart? 
Oh, wait, that's right, that's what we all like about Superman as a character and Wonder Woman as a movie."
"19591","@joshleguern @GraceRandolph I thought movies had to make 3 times there production. The 100 million it cost to make Shazam does not include advertising, marketing etc. So my guess would be it would need to make 300 + million probably closer to 500 million."
"19592","@GailSimone This thread made me happy :) It's Really, REALLY nice to see someone expressing so much joy and not telling people why they should hate something. I am hoping to take my kids to see Shazam soon!"
"19593","@spiderlou2099 I used to know the original Captain Marvel/Shazam because my Dad collected those comic books as a kid. He liked it more than Superman. I knew that the evil worm in the tag scene is Shazam’s worst nemesis Mister Mind."
"19594","@mel_thegreat @Mojitana @AinsleyWynter I don't know if the media would've touched it even without CM. Shazam isn't a big name outside of comic fans, it's not dark and emotionally scarring, and they see it as just a kid movie."
"19595","@mel_thegreat @Mojitana @AinsleyWynter I loved every bit of Shazam. Funny and had so much heart. And if you are familiar with the canon there's a giant spoiler that made me squeal like an excited toddler."

"19638","Shazam is a good movie because it doesn't abuse slow motion and CGI, unlike Man of Steel"

"19640","Shazam is a good movie because it doesn force a team dynamic out of half a dozen characters we barely know. It's nice to see DC fixing the mistakes of Suicide Squad and BvS."

I just can't have high expectations anymore.  Time passes and nothing happens."

"19685","@JacobBrinkworth Normally I'd agree (and be the type of person to tweet this sentiment) but I think Shazam's low budget is accentuated by how cheap all the dialogue and A/B conversational scenes look. It all lacks any sense of intentionality or visual storytelling behind the lighting or staging."
"19686","#Shazam was so good! @ZacharyLevi is such a perfect superhero and I'm so happy he's getting the attention and praise he deserves. Maybe in the sequel, Billy could fight with a frying pan just to satisfy my Tangled-loving heart <U+0001F602>"

"19693","@I_Am_MFR @DanielRPK agree/disagree - Shazam! comes closer to replicating the spirit of 80's action/adventure kids movies than any other movie of the last ten years, while not relying on any of the aesthetic nostalgia trappings of the genre whatsoever"
"19694","I can't believe that the best movie of the DCEU is fucking Shazam, but it earns it. Maybe tied with Wonder Woman too? Anyway Shazam is super fun."

"19776","I was really disappointed with Shazam, because I thought it was the movie where Sinbad played the genie."

"19784","y'all should see shazam. great movie <U+0001F602>"
"19785","Finally watched Shazam tonight, and absolutely loved it. It's way up there on my list of favorite superhero movies, but unsure on where it would rank it. Either way, I definitely give it a strong recommendation."
"19786","since everyone is too WEAK to say it, i’ll do the honors,,,@ZacharyLevi in shazam was a SNACK. he’s an ENTIRE MEAL. that is all i have to say."
"19787","@ThreeOranges To be fair, the language of the title of the article doesn't preclude the fact that Captain Marvel and the acronym ""Shazam"" existed before the 70s series--but the inclusion of the ""70s series"" modifier is redundant as yeah, ""shazam"" has literally always been an acronym"
"19788","Unfair and Frustration<U+0001F62D>"
"19789","Had such a great time with my second viewing of #Shazam and daresay I liked it more. Was drowned out by lots of laughter in the first screening and really got to absorb it this go ‘round. Absolutely love the heroics and the heart in this film, as well as the horror nods."

Typical origin superhero movie. Pretty charming. Unfortunate case of annoying kid syndrome. Very funny. Great second half.

And that stripper joke legit had me crying laughing.

"19797","@BootlegGirl Most recently I've seen:
The LEGO Movie 2 - good and fun
SHAZAM! - superhero movie and a very, very good one at that.
Us - Super scary, but also, like, super deep, yo. 
Dumbo - I didn't really like this one, but it's harmless
Pet Sematary - has some good moments, but mostly eh"

"19800","@thanagariann I rather have Black Adam over GCS and Birds v Sirens TBH.

Black Adam is just as much as a big character as Shazam, and the history is fantastic imo. 

MOS2 exists, it's BVS. New God's should be coming. GLC is dead as fuck though."

"19805","Shazam? Is that you?"
"19806","@J_Rocka It's just like the comics - there's Aquaman' s universe, a Bat universe, a Wonder Woman universe, + a Shazam universe etc. They don't have team ups or interact with characters outside their own circle on a regular basis. The movies will now be like that + that's how it should be"

"19810","Wait.
SHAZAM opened with $53.4 million only?

Ummm....that's not good. <U+0001F615>
Expected more."
"19811","Good article! I always thought the ""Billy is Cap"" thing stared with Power of Shazam. That it started in a secret origins one shot by Roy Thomas blindsided me!"
"19812","And then they're going to debate this for ages tonight, and I will not be able to go see Shazam, fuckers are ruining my evening plans, and then I predict they will settle for the PM's set date of June 30th."
"19813","i loved the new ghostbusters but you have to take into account that shazam had a smaller budget and was released in april, while ghostbusters had almost double the budget and was released in july. the box office industry has also been struggling so the bar is set lower for rn"

"19820","So #JusticeLeague ruined Supermans face so badly they just had to completely remove it for Shazam. I hear Batman’s arm makes a cameo in BOP, and the Flash’s fingers will be in WW2.

"19821","@joethestampede I'm excited to see where the sequel will take it. I was also surprised at some of the casting towards the end of the movie (I hadn't followed much news about it). Who was your favorite Shazam hero?"
"19822","@Sindelo_ I feel if thats the case we should get it in 2022 with the Aquaman sequel and also possibly The Trench or Shazam 2 if WB releases three films that year. 2021 is already fully booked with The Batman, The Suicide Squad &amp; Black Adam according to all my research."

"19825","Look out for a review of #Shazam coming soon."
"19826","So, if the producer of Shazam wanted Henry Cavill but couldn't because of scheduling problems then that means Superman is still part of the universe and Henry Cavill is still the actor in the role. #Shazam"
"19827","Freakin' loved #SHAZAM! @ZacharyLevi  was an absolute joy to watch, Asher Angel was great and Jack Dylan Grazer was a show stealer! The whole family dynamic was great and I really felt for Billy. Great movie! Would recommend it to anyone!"
"19828","@INOXSupport @INOXMovies @ShazamMovie Done, please don't call me unless very necessary."
"19829","Im happy Shazam got good reviews but the movie is doodoo"
"19830","@ChrisKTLA  I’m confused. Apparently there are two characters with the name Captain Marvel? Shazam is what Billy BATSON says to change into Captain Marvel. BTW I have a large size reprint of an original CM comic. Got it in the mid-70s. Shazam! <U+0001F642>"
"19831","@garflyf There’s a scene in Shazam that evoked an incredibly similar response from me and I’m wondering if that’s the sole reason I loved it"
"19832","went to watch shazam alone and,,,,,,,i got scared too but i just thought someone was actually crying into a mic <U+0001F643>"
"19833","@ZacharyLevi was DELIGHTFUL in @ShazamMovie and @Jgrazerofficial is the best young actor working right now. My son is now obsessed with #lightningfrommyhands and I can’t wait to see it again! Also, “Chuck” is about to take over my life as I catch up."

Therefore, in my mind, Billy became Shazam.  Just my thought"
"19835","@AmazonChique Look at it in comparison to their budgets.  $53M is more than half of #Shazam’s $100M budget.  But #Ghostbusters $46M opening is less than a third of its $144M budget. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"19836","Because we're a fallen world and don't deserve things of beauty."
"19837","@DrizzieDoodles Her first 'breakout' scene (with the metal hand things) honestly solidified that movie as amazing for me, I was immediately like ""OKAY I LOVE HER"" after that scene.

Then her sass levels throughout the movie? Fucking FIRE. I love her.

"19945","#Shazam is well worth a watch and just to let you know, DC have gone all Marvel with the credits <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"

There was a lot of fun to be had and yet the fun came organically from believable characters. 8/10."
"19947","There really aren’t any spoilers to discuss in Shazam. That said the movie is a 7.5-8 out of 10. Not better than Aquaman or Wonder Woman but still good."
"19948","Yes please!!!"
"19949","The last one literally happened on twitter here, tho"
"19950","@JeffLassiter @FreddyInSpace i haven’t even seen Shazam but you’re probably right"
"19951","@screenjunkies @MurrellDan @Lons @sjnews @getFANDOM @ShazamMovie Box office =\= quality. I feel the box office argument is really  misused. Transformers also made a lot of money, but no one is praising them as the best thing ever; BladeRunner 2049 was praised, quality movie, but made little money.. What's your point??"
"19952","Watched Shazam and darn its an amazing movie."
"19953","Shazam! was really really fun! I cried! But like a quarter of the audience (mostly young kids and parents) had to leave because of it being scary. It’s not quiiiiite the “family friendly superhero movie” it’s being billed as. It’s got some genuine horror."
"19954","Getting ready to return home, but before we do so; we are going to eat our breakfast first and then watch Shazam."

"19957","Here's my review of #Shazam, read on"
"19958","Just been to see #Shazam. It was brilliant, and there are some real laugh out loud moments."
"19959","@Jeans_Stream @SteveChimpanzee Godzilla has a Soda, Shazam asks for a sip, drinks the whole lot, Godzilla loses his shit. Captain Marvel is still a thot."
"19960","Problem with #shazam is that Billy Badson plays a kid who probably tried a beer or two in his life but Shazam completly ignores it in Zack form."
"19961","@ChaseStein_ Oh, Dumbo is Top 1 in my country and Shazam is not even in the Top 10..."
"19962","@HappyHarryToons New 52 Shazam is the best shazam design."
"19963","Since this is the new trend:
After seeing #Shazam this is my ranking of the #DCEU movies:
1-All of them, I love all of them! Now let me have some more please! @wbpictures"
"19964","Holy crap. They're actually gunning for the child actors of DC now."
"19965","Hey, how about something positive for the day?  Go see @ShazamMovie now.  It's one of the better films out there and should warm even the darkest of souls up."
"19966","wanna watch shazam because of asher angel :("
"19967","omg ppl are now complaining that jack dylan grazer playing a disabled character in shazam is bad bc he’s not disabled irl. oh my god. it’s called acting dude what the fuck"
"19968","Potentially yes, but there’s still a long way to go for cinema superhero films to bring their LGBT representation up to the same levels as DCTV. If you can miss it through one off hand vague comment then it’s not major representation. It’s just throwing a nugget for those looking"
"19969","i mentally added victors dad"
"19970","@TheQuartering @heelvsbabyface You should compare Shazam to Captain Marvel."
"19971","@ZacharyLevi just watched Shazam. OMG!!! Best decision I have ever made. Loved the movie and loved you. I’m a huge fan of you and your amazing work. So happy and proud of you. You deserve the best. There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel. God bless &amp; good luck. <U+0001F618><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"19972","Suddenly unpopular opinion. 

Shazam is a bad movie."
"19973","1) Shazam!
2) Alita: Battle Angel
3) Fighting With My Family 
4) Happy Death Day 2U
5) The Dirt

(Note: ranked by favourites, not by grade.)"
"19974","I wish I knew if I won this Shazam contest or not<U+0001F97A> @jakemiller @Shazam"
"19975","My family and I did our part...TWICE to push @ShazamMovie to the number 1 spot! Yes it is that AWESOME! Outstanding job by the entire cast and crew! A WIN for for DCU and Superhero fans! We can’t wait to meet @ZacharyLevi at @MegaConOrlando next month! <U+0001F929>"
"19976","going to see Shazam today with some friends. gonna be a good day. can i get a hell yeah"
"19977","Hey @adamcarolla and @BaldBryan, it’s funny you confused the Captain Marvel and Shazam movies, up until just a few years ago, the comic book character Shazam was named Captain Marvel. There were two of them. @AdamCarollaShow"
"19978","@Jamesy_IA_K @GraceRandolph You say that when Wonder Women and Shazam are a thing, you also say that when it looks like we’re getting quality DC in the future. You do realize the guy who made those films trash is gone now right"

"19982","Fun Fact: #Shazam adds the BEST lyrics to Eye of the Tiger. Four beautiful words that I’ll forever sing along to with that song."
"19983","Captain Marvel beating Captain Marvel. <U+26A1>"
"19984","As much as I am drooling over @erwanheussaff Pavlova video, I am DYING to know what the title of the BG song is and who sang it. Shazam and SoundHound could not figure it out. <U+0001F611>"
"19985","@Shaadennn That scene at the end of the movie where it was in the cafeteria and Shazam says I called a friend. I literally jumped out of my seat screaming"
"19986","@ZacharyLevi I’m going to see shazam with my family today, i am sooo hyped."
"19987","@just_domii @ShazamMovie @zoecarpenter6 I’ll give you a full write up! And by write up I mean the use of GIF’s and a couple words"
"19988","@psilovefood They have done amazing for wonder women, Aquaman and Shazam... They should go on single thread rather than creating different thread each time"
"19989","@RyanActorTaylor @ShazamMovie @TheDCUniverse I'm hearing accolades on this from those in the know."
"19990","I've always been a Marvel girl but after looking at #Shazam and #JokerMovie trailers, I might change sides. Especially after seeing the most recent Marvel Endgame Trailer. I cringed so hard at CM that I literally had to go vomit"
"19991","@Jin_Butterfly @BTS_twt I live in the us so I’m going to focus on YT red and Spotify. 
I know Spotify premium counts more towards charts and I have 2 premium accs I can stream with. I don’t use Apple Music often but I’ll buy the tracks/album on there &amp; google play. And I’ll Shazam if I can!!<U+0001F499> @BTS_twt"

"19993","@comicsjean that’s the one in shazam. that’s wasn’t even a big deal except in that SAME video someone said the f slur and they all laughed..."
"19994","@HenryGayden thank you so much for the incredible movie, #shazam is a masterpiece <U+0001F495>"
"19995","the thunder and lightning is so strong wtf billy stop yelling shazam"
"19996","Loved this movie"
"19997","Sure it's hard to imagine how anyone would react in that instance but Billy was a far more mature and smart character than Shazam ever acts. Also considering ""The Wisdom of Solomon"" is one of Shazams powers he really is a dumbass."
"19998","Watched Shazam yesterday. I enjoyed it. Nice to see that DC remembered they can still do peril without having to be so damn serious. Saying that, Mark Strongs Villain carried alot of the 'weight' of the film."
"19999","Two gripes. Billy and Shazam didn't really act like each out. Billy was a rough loner, an outcast. Shazam was a hyper active jokey guy. I didn't believe that Shazam was just Billy, but grown up."
"20000","WB proved me wrong... Shazam was really good.

I liked the massive downplaying of the Greek themes, just for the benefit of Wonder Woman.

Making him more typically magic based with the sins was smart."
"20001","to be invisible!"
"20002","god i love shazam so much......... im rly on my ""loving kid superheroes"" bullshit tonight"
"20003","It's fine not to like a movie, but at the very least know the basics like the name of the titular character. Pretty sure Billy doesn't turn into Zachary Levi.

""For reasons too idiotic to explain here, the kid can transform himself into Zachary Levi simply by saying, 'Shazam!'"""
"20004","Ok, going to ikea tomorrow and seeing shazam on Thursday. Sorted."
"20005","Shazam was such a feel-good movie hahahaha pero bat ganon I had a sudden realization that I'm so old and no longer a wild happy-go-lucky teen anymore hahahahaha too early for a quarter life crisis"
"20006","Dark, brooding and thoughtful works too. But I agree. There should be a balance. There could be an argument made that what’s made the MCU so successful of late is their lighthearted almost comedic attitude toward everything beneath the seemingly hopeless/tragic situations"
"20007","@TheCaptain66453 @Future_Bat 1- Man of steel 
2-shazam
3- Wonder woman y aquaman
4- BvS

"20008","@ZacharyLevi you won't read this but Shazam was funny, well paced and delightful. Can't wait for a sequel."
"20009","Hey @ZacharyLevi I saw #Shazam last night! I thought it was SO good! You are one of my favorite superheros <U+0001F604><U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"20010","shazam actually one of my favorite superhero films now.... so lighthearted and fun i’m crying aND THE LORE THEY GOT THE LORE SO WELL"
"20011","Shazam! is movie of the year so far"
"20012","DC has a true hit on its hands. We talked about @ZacharyLevi, the great humor throughout and ask ourselves where we would like to see the #DCEU to go. Check it out. 

#PodernFamily #FilmTwitter #Shazam @ShazamMovie @DCComics @TheDCUniverse"
"20013","Definitely needed this tutorial on Shazam! @BTS_twt #Map_Of_The_Soul_Persona"
"20014","There’s a difference between a blockbuster and an epic movie. Blockbusters can be bigger or smaller, but an epic is larger and has a different feel. For instance: Shazam! is a smaller blockbuster, Avengers movies are big blockbusters and King of the Monsters looks like an epic."
"20015","@RicardoESegarra I thought SHAZAM was good. Just like I thought Captain Marvel was good...and diversity had nothing to do with that. Now that someone brings it up it was solid and diverse. Everytime people look at movies through that lens it turns something enjoyable into a me vs them controversy"
"20016","@wrytersview I liked it.
I saw it twice once with my Brother and Nephew and the other with a friend.
Gonna go watching Shazam tonight<U+0001F44D>"
"20017","Update: I'm seeing Shazam. They have a student deal on weekdays so there's a 100% chance I'll be back next week to see CARRROLLLLL"
"20018","@warpingfist64 @SamuelLott10 @Davidla95Dh @n_spidey I never really had any interest in Shazam he was kinda boring to me so I did not watch the movie"
"20019","Not holding off any longer seeing Shazam tonight"
"20020","@UberKryptonian Wait in the comics is it true that Billy as Shazam is the form of his biological father?"
"20021","If you thought the horror stuff in Shazam was intense then just wait until they drop a Spectre movie."
"20022","@Blockbustedpod That’s funny considering YMS have Shazam a pretty favorable review"
"20023","Successfully finished recording new songs! <U+0001F4AA> nowww as a reward going to the cinema to watch Shazam <U+0001F601>"
"20024","Laughed so much watching @ShazamMovie it was full of fights, great family moments and just a lot of fun. <U+0001F913>

#Shazam ain't messing around with that childhood trauma."
"20029","Got a green frog plushie from the toy crane earlier. He's surprised that I actually got something HAHAHA though to be fair, I gave it to him since he bought tickets from Shazam! and he came with me to get OR from that scary place <U+0001F602>"

"20034","#Shazam is the only DC movie I'm willing to watch, Batman or Superman is just too serious and also dark. Seriously they're hard to watch cause they're hard to tell what's going on.

Let's go #Shazam! 
Also, can't wait for Avengers: Endgame!!"

"20037","I really enjoyed Shazam, and to be honest the diversity and amazing story line was the best"
"20038","Anyone that dislikes or hates on Shazam has poor taste and is actually an idiot..."
"20039","Taking a 9 year old and a 3 year old to the cinema was the worst decision of my life....but Shazam was amazing!!!!"
"20040","The more I think about Shazam the more I want to see it again. I think it might end up being a cult adventure film like the Goonies or Raiders, one that kids that see it now hold on to it for years."
"20041","I Shazam when Brandon plays his music and I’m not ashamed."
"20042","@MikeKalinowski hey Mike, as it’s Shazam’s time to shine, I thought I’d ask if you were familiar with a couple of British superheroes that are influenced by Shazam. Aimed at younger kids, Super Ted and Banana Man have very obvious traits that come from him."
"20043","I learned 2 things seeing #Shazam

1) More movies should happen in Philadelphia.

2) My bladder will not be strong enough to watch a 3 hour long Avengers movie without an adult diaper."

"20051","Shazam was ok! But can't help feeling that this whole war between marvel and DC is kinda childish(but good money of course) and ppl are just falling for it lol."
"20052","Shazam is great. Shows that a DC film can stand on its own by sticking to an appropriate tone, having fun, and not using a blue filter."
"20053","@MShawnSmith @Nick_Leitner13 @ColliderVideo @PNemiroff @HaleighFoutch @MrJayWashington Agreed. The REAL #SuperheroFatigue is yet-another #EndOfTheWorld, ticking time bomb and/or #SkyBeam movie. There are other superhero stories beyond just direct end of the world, eg, #CaptainMarvel, &amp; even that plot can be done indirectly, #AntMan, #Aquaman, #Shazam, etc."

and a good app"
"20056","Missed opportunity in SHAZAM: instead of Billy and Freddy playing Mortal Kombat, they shouldve been playing Super Smash Brothers with Billy playing as Pikachu. This could’ve given him the idea to use the move thunder in fight scenes which is kinda what happens when he says SHAZAM"

"20062","@JanArrah Same with Shazam allegedly, because WB initially wanted to go darker. I'm glad they waited this long if that's the case since the movie is fantastic as it is"
"20063","@keileykaiser At this point I just want a superman sequel I am so desperate , I loved the character for ages. Sandberg is busy with Shazam or he will be my director pick but  J.A. Bayona would make a great second choice."
"20064","@HenryGayden Can u please write a superman movie *Superman fans are so desperate for a sequel &amp; Shazam was such a great movie* , Congrats on the success btw"
"20065","ok so I’m going to the cinema with my ten year old brother and I’m going to try and see shazam! with him even though it’s a 12A. we managed to see infinity war and captain marvel with the same rating but if we can’t, I’m gonna watch Dumbo <U+0001F614><U+2728>"
"20066","oh btw Shazam is a lot of fun. tone problems all the way through because it’s literally a family action comedy in the body of a DCEU movie, but beyond that, genuinely really endearing and funny in a way only 90s/00s kids movies are. also my son zachery levi hasn’t aged a day"

"20086",".@ShazamMovie was even better than second time around. It's just a shame the young teens next to me thought it cool to talk during the WHOLE movie. Nothing ruins a movie like someone being rude."

"20097","@GraceRandolph I watched Shazam!, Captain Marvel, and Alita: Battle Angel yesterday. 

I actually preferred Alita the most. Shazam was the funniest. And I liked Captain Marvel a little more than I expected. Probably Iron Man 2-level. They did try too hard w/ the 90s references."

"20426","@RicPendragon @Jonnysource @RoosterTeeth @DEATHBATTLE True about Supes weakness to magic,  but the two are comparable.  Superman has won his share of fights against Shazam as well.
The last DB Captain Marvel was in,  she beat Android  17 from Dragon Ball.  I’d suggest rewatching that for a rundown if you don’t want to do a lore dive"

"20431","Shazam had such a sweet '80s vibe. Just a ragtag bunch of kids and some rare-for-2019 earnestness."
"20432","zachary levi is too dreamy and I won't stand for it"
"20433","Y'all, I can say Shazam's a totally great movie--riveting and amusing. I enjoyed seeing it a lot. Now let's see if it could beat Avengers: Endgame. Will have to wait for a while, though."
"20434","By the way, Mark Strong as a villain in Shazam still gave me an impression of his role as Merlin in Kingsman."
"20435","The Shazam! sequel will be called Sha2am!. I don’t make the rules."
"20436","The DC fan in me wants to love Shazam but it's honestly super mediocre. It's different from the typical dark and gloomy setting that you get from most DC movies, it's funny and clearly aimed at a younger audience"
"20437","Should’ve put it out on a friday, im watching on friday <U+0001F91D>"

Do we consider the DCU starting with Man of Steel?

So... I guess... hmmmm...

You know what?

The one I've seen the most is Suicide Squad. As bad as it was, I enjoyed it the most on repeat viewings."

Now I’m SUPER gonna see it"

"20447","@In_Cli_Nation You say it’s kept the lights on but it’s also to a large extent been a deadend for them. Especially their films were making less and less each time, and it’s only started to turn around with the brighter hero focused films like Aquaman and Shazam"
"20448","@In_Cli_Nation @noorhal True, and I think it’s a mistake. The films that have been getting the critical acclaim (WW, Aquaman and Shazam) focus on the hero. The over reliance on villains just feels like a throw back, all the way to Burton tbh, and the frankly insane opinion that the hero isn’t the draw"
"20449","I need to watch Shazam actually."
"20450","@mas_critical Yes... Anything to get everyone to stop bickering about Shazam"

"20465","@A21starman @Jonnysource @RoosterTeeth @DEATHBATTLE To be fair to Supes tho (even tho I'm not a fan of his) Shazam's power comes from magic, giving him a power advantage over Superman.

As for Carol, most my knowledge for her power comes from what Rogue drained from her <U+0001F605> and Rogue has the advantage cos of her draining too"

You give them chance after chance to redeem themselves but they just throw it back in your face.

"20475","@DrWatstoned My favorite part of the movie is when that drunk dude yelled Shazam! in the bathroom and scared the daylights out of that kid that was in one of the stalls."
"20476","@leon_woodley @GiteshPandya Kids movies have horrendous drops on SUN/MON(70-89%) on non holidays because kids are at school and clearly cannot go to the movies on Mondays. A few CBMs drop in the 70s(not as low as Shazam's 78%) but those are movies that didn't release in the summer like GOTG2 n CM."

"20483","@TireIron_ @FFadeaway Ehhh, I legitimately do not enjoy Star Wars anymore and haven’t for a while..

As for DC, some of their movies have been shit. But their overall comics and movies like Shazam, the Dark Knight Trilogy and Wonderwoman were pretty damn good. Upcoming Joker looks incredible. So idk"

"20596","Thinking about Shazam! and how by the end I felt like Zachary Levi's version of Billy was really just a supporting character, even though he's on all the promotional material."
"20597","Escapist fiction can take the pressure off reality. Shazam is still with me 5 days later -- like a shot of optimistic faith to the soul, it reminds me to turn toward courage and hope, and away from cynicism and resignation. The reason I love superheroes. And @ZacharyLevi"
"20598","@SiahJ_Andre That response really irritated me. She could have at least said ""I'm talking about Shazam not CA"" but she really said ""I shouldn't have to apply critical thinking to what you said"" despite her asking us, the audience, to apply critical thinking to what she said. A whole dummy"
"20599","Saw #shazam<U+26A1>. It's not all bad. It has a good message. The villain was very well developed and his motivation was good. It's a fun movie but is tiring at the end. Idk it's better than cm but still eh. I prefer Aquaman to this. I'll give it  a 7.5/10"
"20600","Finally able to see Shazam last night and it was great! Highly recommended, DC is on fire lately with these films."
"20601","@XboxCanada @janicour  has telepathic powers to know when she is needed without ever asking her #Shazam #shazamxobx"
"20602","If the future DC movies will retain a similar quality to Shazam (just got back from cinema) then damn I'm interested."
"20603","He yelled “Shazam!”, and just like that money appeared."
"20604","@JacobSHall Such a great point. Also, making Freddie's hero able-bodied was a huge disappointment too. Huge ableism misstep. Loved the movie, very disappointed in the things it got wrong. @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi"
"20605","Such a great point. Also, making Freddie's hero able-bodied was a huge disappointment too. Huge ableism misstep. Loved the movie, but very disappointed in the things it got wrong. #Shazam @ShazamMovie @ZacharyLevi"
"20606","I would want my friend to be able to fly."
"20607","Yes! And Shazam every time you hear the song on the radio. 

Radio stations use Shazam to see if ppl in their area tune in and are interested in the songs."
"20608","John Krasinski. 

I would watch that movie fifty times at least"
"20609","I don’t know about you but I’m mostly disappointed that Shaquille O’Neil isn’t in SHAZAM."
"20610","<U+0001F644><U+0001F644> Wanting to lift weights and be muscular is not fatphobia. You should be celebrating that a kid wants to be that dedicated especially when weight training takes physical and mental strength."
"20611","@andrewxko @ShazamMovie Lmk how it is cuz I keep hearing how good it is even though the trailers REALLY put me off."
"20612","@GWF_1987 Shazam is a comedy. But each dramatic/scary moment is never interrupted for a lame joke. It stays in that moment. Just because they have jokes, doesn't make it like Marvel."
"20613","@ponysmasher your movie is this powerful. Hat’s off to you sir <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB>"
"20614","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures That’s what they said about justice league..."
"20615","Most Superheros are inspired by 3,000 year old Greek myths. Roman myths in the 8th century. 
Many more diverse characters representing people today have already been created in the last 20 years. <U+0001F3A4>"
"20616","Wtf is wrong with people nowadays"
"20617","Feeling good post-Shazam! Vibes <U+0001F389> enjoyed the film, enjoyed the wine and popcorn, enjoyed the company @lukemorgantweet, Twas a good afternoon movie <U+0001F4AB> @ShazamMovie #Shazam"
"20618","About to see #Shazam. Let's see what Zachary Levi can do in tights.

Wait..."
"20619","So I saw @ShazamMovie and I loved it. It was funny and actiony just like I like it! @ZacharyLevi is the best and I am so glad he is in it! Plus we have the same birthday so I like him even more!! Go see Shazam y’all!!!"
"20620","@jfordrob I thought Shazam was just a PG version of Deadpool lol"
"20621","At least 3 ppl have gone to see Shazam ! cuz I hyped it up for them mY IMPACT"
"20622","@_madiford @ShazamMovie It was! Thoroughly surprised."
"20623","Why is there not an app like Shazam except you can use it to find the music used in videos mahn"
"20624","So good!!! @SelitaEbanks and I watched it last night!  @MeaganGood <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>"
"20625","We’re finally watching Shazam tonight"
"20626","Is there anyone more suited to write SHAZAM! than @BRIANMBENDIS ? Being an experienced foster parent himself, his way of writing teenage characters... I hope @JimLee &amp; DiDio see this! He's the perfect fit!"
"20627","Shazam! redefines masculinity in the DC universe."
"20628","@ShazamMovie @wbpictures I loooveee this movie!!!!"
"20629","Think it was a mistake to see Shazam and Clockwork Orange 3 hours apart. Going to be bladdered by the time its Mr. Kubrick’s masterpiece is on."
"20630","Oh sweet Jesus.

Can we just let the superhero movie breathe?"
"20631","I wanted to personally thank @BroncoWeirdo and @djcrimmy for going out of their way to watch my review for #Shazam. That and the many others who did so after I retweeted that no one watched it. 
I'm sort of riding on a guilty coincidence that I guilted anyone to see it."
"20632","#Shazam I just saw the movie, great film, and it was so damn hilarious, plus it had great action!"
"20633","I'm gonna wait to see #Shazam until I'm feeling less cynical. I'm sure I'll like it, but I can't help but look at the reaction as compared to more diverse superhero films and think about how media made by straight white dudes don't have to endure prejudiced backlash and boycotts."
"20634","@ZacharyLevi Your welcome loved the movie ill be an extra on shazam 2 k ok lol"
"20635","This Week’s Movies
Climax
Beach Bum 
Cabin in the woods
-pending-
Shazam
Pet Semetary
Undecided comedy film picked by the fiancé"
"20636","@SHAAN87989064 @GiteshPandya And before say ""Well 'Spiderverse was animated..."" yeah so were half the mega-hits of the past several years from Illumination or Pixar so that's not an excuse either. ;) 'Spiderverse cost about the same as Shazam and was based upon a MUCH more popular IP....good comparison."
"20637","@Banksofficialy What's the fuck is Shazam where we talking of Spotify"
"20638","@ZacharyLevi Saw #Shazam! Speaking as a long term DC fan you absolutely nailed it and made a great film. One minor quibble, where were Sarah and Casey? ;-)"
"20639","<U+0001F914> So if my understanding is correct you wanted Freddy.. to fight the demonic embodiment of sin with his crutches??? This would satiate you?"
"20640","Don’t forget Super Friends there’s still plenty of time left to enter our latest #giveaway."
"20641","I see why his suit fits him the way he does, and boy was I wrong initially about what I thought #Shazam was going to be when it was announced. This is how the DCEU should move forward in the future."
"20642","#Shazam rocks! This is how the DCEU should have started out!"
"20643","I also don’t know why DC fans gripe about the name so much. Shazam is a much cooler name."
"20644","I’m probably the only person who likes Shazam and Captain Marvel about equally. Shazam is a bit better but I thoroughly enjoyed both."
"20645","@comicsexplained Shazam is my favorite DC hero. Im such a fan of the pre new 52 Shazam i have a hard time with the current iteration sometimes. I enjoyed the movie alot. Its top three DC films for me. Could have done without Sivana. Overall, loved seeing Shazam on the big screen."
"20646","Incidentally @johntwitstan and I are about to see Shazam! I know almost nothing about the comics version (god I need to get back into comic reading) so here's hoping it'll be a fun watch!"
"20647","Every good origin story always has d character getting its a$s beat &amp; overcoming the turmoil inside. 
Batman is afraid of bats, Superman is weak against kryptonite &amp; Shazam is afraid of losing his family."
"20648","We all dit, Gail, the movie is full of heart"
"20649","Yes the people trying to outwoke each other and problematise really great aspects of Shazam suck, but it’s really not worth giving them attention/spreading that- not only because it’s so dumb, but given it’s third act stuff it’s not worth spoiling for people over such non issues."
"20650","Curious as to what my Shazam! glow up would be"
"20651","Definitely have decided that I am gonna take myself to @ShazamMovie tomorrow after work."
"20652","hey @ZacharyLevi and @brielarson you two need to make this IRL!!"
"20653","@Spazkidin3d Shazam looks like why I’m sort of glad DC is ignoring literally everything they did."
"20654","2019:

"20655","@RealLeitungVG Man I really wish people wouldn’t compare Shazam to the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies because that’s like the easiest way to make me want to see it."
"20656","@Babylonian @DOOM just saw shazam on sunday, so many fucking plotholes and meta references. i wanted to sink into my seat away from the movie."
"20657","@Melipastel1 Was tough getting back to work this weekend cuz Shazam and Pet Semetary both came out at the exact same day"
"20658","Shazam is excellent lmaooo really great"
"20659","Shazam, a spoiler free review by me:

B+. Highly entertaining! A bit long to get to the meats and bones. Some script revision errors that somehow made it to the final without anyone going “waaaait”."
"20660","Aquaman, MoS, Shazam, WW, the other movies didn’t happen. Official DCEU rankings."
"20661","Jus finished watching @ShazamMovie. It turned out to be good.take a bow @DCComics @TheDCUniverse. Waiting for the  next series."
"20662","@BTS_twt J-Hope! I was on work. And when I was not busy, I had my tutorial on how to Shazam your songs. Especially the upcoming Boy With Luv or the whole album of Persona. Then my daily lifestyle which is listening &amp; watching BTS videos. You're the reason why I'm still happy &amp; fighting!"
"20663","Monday 15th April RLS Film Night at the @GranvilleThtr The evening films both at 8pm and 12As will be Shazam! and The White Crow. Also showing Missing Link and Wonder Park. Hope to see some of you there. #ShopLocal #Ramsgate"
"20664","Shazam! was good. It was much better then I thought it would be. Marvel/DC movies don’t disappoint. It’s cool how there are so many stories and characters in both comics. They can make endless amounts of movies."
"20665","@wlohaty I like most of it BUT I hated the Superman “cameo” , I get that Henry cavil wasn’t available, but why not just bring in gal gadot to Jason manos. Also the Shazam family was cool but I grew tired of adults acting like children pretty quick."
"20666","Still can't get over Shazam and Captain Marvel. Stan @brielarson and @ZacharyLevi or perish"
"20667","i feel like i enjoyed shazam even more the second time??

which basically means that i am already planning my third time"
"20668","@andrewj_gomez Man all the trailers for Shazam made me cringe but spider verse is probably my fave film of the last decade"
"20669","@danielleradford @MurrellDan @RothCornet @joestarr187 @sjnews have you guys discussed the extended Godzilla trailer that is showing before Shazam?"
"20670","finally watching the end of shazam because I had to leave before it was over last time and like . barely anyone in this theater HHHHH"
"20671","@ERCboxoffice The sequel is already in development, so I'm not too concerned about the box office for Shazam anymore. Still a shame that such a quality film isn't making that much money, though. Maybe WB should have released Shazam in August instead of three weeks before Endgame."
"20672","I’m not saying Shazam not giving us a still fat, still disabled set of superheroes isn’t somewhat problematic. It is. But what I’m saying is, I only see y’all having this energy for DC."
"20673","The realest Shazam review. The kind of bloggers we need."
"20674","what could i do for the next hour and a half until shazam"
"20675","Shazam what an absolute ace movie <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"20676","@DoYouEvenLIf Not surprised. If you grew up on the movie Big it’s hard not to have a bit of nostalgia watching Shazam."
"20677","Great dig into how Shazam follows in the paw prints of another movie you might not think of as a ""body swap""."
"20678","Oh yes, LOTS of posi-vibes!"
"20679","just went to see shazam! they only played about 10 seconds of legend but it was coooool. the rest of the people in the cinema just heard the song of the century and they didn’t even know it"
"20680","Just saw the @ShazamMovie. Funny seeing Chuck as a superhero. @ZacharyLevi, nice work <U+0001F60E>"
"20681","@ZacharyLevi Oh my god!!! Glorious work in #ShazamMovie I bow to your greatness Sir... <U+2665><U+FE0F><U+2665><U+FE0F><U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"20682","Didn’t anyone notice Anabelle doll in #Shazam. Never saw anything relating to that post release <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>

"20684","Shazam is the best movie DC has made in a really long time. Well done."
"20685","Wow
Absolutely great
Totally loved #Shazam 
The best #DCEU film yet

Must watch if you're a #superhero fanatic and I think it was better than #MARVEL version of #CaptainMarvel
Great Job by 
@ZacharyLevi
@AsherAngel
As well as Jack Dylan as Freddie!

Congrats to David Sandberg!"
"20686","hi shazam is a great movie and i feel really good now"

Listening to a Beagle snore and I'm thinking of you 
Just know that I'm thinking of you 
Thinking of you"
"20688","Saw shazam today, was really enjoyable but I was expecting more"
"20689","Mfw #CaptainMarvel isn't the best Captain Marvel movie of this year
Definitely seeing my new favourite comic movie #Shazam in cinemas again"
"20690","Saw “Shazam” yesterday, and it was freaking good.

If you told me years ago that the leading films for the DC Cinematic Universe were WW, Aquaqman, and Captain Mar- I mean Shazam, I’d call you an idiot."
"20691","My best friend's superpower would be hyper intelligence and his abilities would be able to quickly solve any problem."
"20692","@btschartdata @RadioNowHouston @Q102Philly @1027kj103 @BTS_twt Get ready to shazam, fam! <U+0001F49C>"
"20693","It's Shazam time. In cinema, waiting for a movie."
"20694","@ZacharyLevi @SixFlagsMexico I have been in the cinema right now, I have seeing shazam, again. I see it 2 times and jim going to see it again next week. IM fucking in love with you!"
"20695","I’m seeing Shazam tonight idc if I gotta go by myself"
"20696","This morning was so scary :( but atleast I feel better now and I’m seeing Shazam soon"
"20697","I didn't see that coming. #adambrody #SHAZAM @ZacharyLevi soooo cool."
"20698","Come to @sixflagsovertx next!!"
"20699","Going to see #Shazam this afternoon <U+263A><U+FE0F>"
"20700","We all so lucky to live in a time of all these great things coming out every month. Like isn’t amazing how in the same month we are getting a movie as empowering as Shazam!, we are getting a 5-day convention to celebrate all things Star Wars... and at the end of it all, ENDGAME!"
"20701","The struggle in finding a non-marvel shirt to wear to see Shazam at the cinema..."
"20702","Went to see @ShazamMovie today. I loved it. Just one question though. What is a suit wrangler? @ZacharyLevi"
