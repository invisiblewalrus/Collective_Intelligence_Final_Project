Last night I had a dilemma. The wonderful people who schedule press screenings had given us two movies in the same night. I could either see Pet Sematary or The Best of Enemies. https://t.co/w0OX3dBH2R"
"2781","4) So, given my family background, I decided I would buck the trend and go see #BestOfEnemies instead of seeing Pet Sematary.

The Grail Knight would have been proud of my choice… https://t.co/JT7EhXNWPP"
"2782","9) I am not ashamed to say I was wiping tears off my cheeks when #BestOfEnemies ended. It got a standing ovation from the crowd. It will help all of us to understand the power of listening to each other a little bit. In these fractured times, we could all use a lot more of that."
"2783","5) Best of Enemies isn’t a perfect film. It feels a little too simplistic at times and I am betting some folks will be upset that the KKK leader (played by Sam Rockwell) isn’t depicted as all that bad a guy from the start."
"2784","3) Best of Enemies takes place in Durham, NC in 1971 as the city wrestles with the issue of school desegregation. My grandfather ( https://t.co/JeYQ7reoMZ ) was mayor of Durham in the 1950s and 60s and was noted for the great progress he made on race relations in the city."
"2785","2) Nearly every critic I know went with Pet Sematary, which has been getting some buzz and is being marketed in a pretty big way, over the smaller Best of Enemies that some described as “another Green Book” (which isn’t necessarily a good thing in my crowd)."
"2786","6) #BestOfEnemies follows a predictable formula. But, it is still a very enjoyable film, full of emotion and heart with some clever moments of humor mixed in. It feels entirely real (it is based on a real story and several of the characters in the movie consulted on the film)."

"3826","This is, of course, how intersectionals dream of ending racism. Giving white supremacists something dark and moist after a long day of slaughtering black ""patriarchs"". She had a fucking ebony actress seamless set up for her white zaddy vincent cirrincione"

"3828","So can't wait to see this.   I love every movie @TherealTaraji play in.. she is definitely my role model...I love you chick...keep them movies coming hunny!!!<U+0001F618>"
"3829","@glewis5371 I'm sorry that is how you experienced the movie. I live in Durham and it the story is part of our legacy. I read the book years ago and recall both Ann and CP mage huge shifts in their perceptions. I hope to see #BestOfEnemies this weekend."
"3830","@alissamarie In your 1st post your stated ""Due to, uh, corneal injuries and various Game of Thrones related responsibilities, I am not getting a chance to review BEST OF ENEMIES""
Which is true? #BestofEnemies"
"3831","#BestOfEnemies gives me hope"
"3832","@RoleReboot @brettwrites I live in Durham, NC and this story is part of our legacy. It is about changing perceptions, and not about whiteness. #BestOfEnemies"
"3833","@alissamarie A review on a movie you didn't see and a story you don't know is not a smart move. This story of perceived differences, on the part of a white KKK leader and a black woman is near and dear to the heart of the City of Durham. #BestOfEnemies"
"3834","@alissamarie Your tweeted ""Due to, uh, corneal injuries and various Game of Thrones related responsibilities, I am not getting a chance to review BEST OF ENEMIES (the Rockwell/Henson film, not the Neville/Vidal doc)."" 

Which is true?"
"3835","A good review of  #BestOfEnemies"
"3836","@alissamarie Based on your review of a movie you did not see, I will avoid Amazing Grace, and go see #BestOfEnemies."

"3838","A viewing of this film is, more than anything else, likely to convince a bigot that it’s enough to “do his best,” to go so far as to tear up up his metaphorical Klan membership card and sell gas to black people. My take on #TheBestOfEnemies for @thedaily:

"3843","Congratulations to @robinbissell - THE BEST OF ENEMIES arrives in theaters today! https://t.co/ubgqJIdnqX"
"3844","Hot take: the best of enemies was a really good movie! It was a lot more accurate than the green book and it was a simply better movie"
"3845","@GraceRandolph Are you doing a best of enemies review ? I’m seeing it right now"
"3846","You said a mouthful. I watched The Best of Enemies today.  You know Octavia, how Oprah tells us align your personality with your purpose this is my connection..."
"3847","The only thing I would’ve like to change is to be a part of this film. An incredible story."
"3848","@ChrisCr00952000 @CindyJo_23666 @WireAmerican No one is perfect. No one's marriage is picture perfect either. I would rather have a President who is strong and takes action against our enemies, fights for our Veterans and Military.  Best of all, he puts America 1st!"
"3849","#TheBestOfEnemies is causing quite the stir with critics. Controversy aside, it wasn’t all bad. The performances are great. The film just feels SO familiar and a bit slow. It doesn’t switch things up to make the story impact you like it should have. But still, it’s not awful. https://t.co/FKqmNmoNNO"
"3850","wanna go see the best of enemies."
"3851","@cpicciolini @GMA @TherealTaraji @OshaDavidson #TheBestOfEnemies film is inspirational because I want to always show thanks to the brave people who stood up for my civil rights dozens and hundreds of years before my birth. I show my thanks via being educated, fiscally responsible, and an upstanding citizen."
"3852","@ProductionHUB @TherealTaraji @BestEnemiesFilm I saw #BestOfEnemies tonight. Bravo Ms. Henson and Mr. Rockwell. Bravo. I wouldn’t be where I am without Ms. Atwater &amp; Mr. Ellis."
"3853","Few movies covering civil rights history could be called world-changing. But this one is: “The Best of Enemies.” Sam Rockwell plays a Klansman who every American will like. Durham NC 1971. https://t.co/TrAYNJ51Zd"
"3854","Calling it now: the best of enemies will be nominated for best picture next year...i liked it more than greenbook!<U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FB>"
"3855","The movie is something. A must-watch."
"3856","@yeagerszn I feel like he will see Eren struggle and jump in to help like old times. Ofc he "" hated"" Eren for what he did but I feel like he cooled down and because of what Jean said he will join Erens side to fight the enemies because that is his best option and Eren did what he did to -"

"3861","@darkpipboy the best telling for unblockables is the previous attack, it's always different for grab/sweep/piercing. And the vast majority of the enemies can only do one of these from neutral"
"3862","Outlived the Soviet Union. Would be best if nobody overthrown the Romanovs, Finland was pretty much a self governing state. Russia was thrown into the abyss in the 20 century. And thrown again the late 20 century. Stop praying for my country to get owned. Bigger enemies out there"
"3863","Best of Enemies is a good movie!!"
"3864","@p_k_rogers @ReneeCarrollAZ @YuH8TM3 No … not really … the beast never sleeps … so the enemies of decency are incredibly motivated.

"3865","@ProductionHUB @TherealTaraji @BestEnemiesFilm Another self-righteous, black persecuted by white slave owners of the south rings hollow.  I'm white.  I immigrated from Ireland.  STOP portraying all Whites as racists.  If so, I'll stop portraying all blacks as racist, violent criminals.  You feel me???"
"3866","What the F*** makes you think you can sabotage film backers such as Best of Enemies, Empire, and Hidden Figures to defend a known prostitute who was picked up by David Tomb and secretly recorded.  Is this the man who you purpost is innocent?"

"3870","Just saw Best of Enemies. Whew! Deep. Heavy. Moving. Revealing of power structures in place that wanted nothing more to keep blacks folks in their place. This was real life. Also, Taraji P. Henson deserves an award for that. Sam Rockwell, too."

"3880","Lots of older ladies in the audience for THE BEST OF ENEMIES, so lots of chattering the whole time. No way to stop it. To endure, I pretended their outbursts — “She’s gonna tell him” “That looks like Sharon’s house” etc — were coming from adorable 4-year-olds (as you do)."
