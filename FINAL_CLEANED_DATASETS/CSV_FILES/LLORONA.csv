"2","@michaelchaves @nytimes @lalloronamovie @wbpictures @newlinecinema I think the conjuring franchise is getting diluted by bad movies like the nun and now lallorona <U+0001F610> need to take decent time and deliver good movies that critics and audience love like the first two conjuring movies <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> else the franchise will die."

"19","I REEEEAAAAALLLLYYYYY don’t want to write up a review for #LaLlorona 

It was just so boring and paint-by-numbers. In fact, there you go. That’s my review. It’s like a banana: Bland, uninteresting, and unwilling to do that really cool trick in the bedroom. 

4/10."
"20","Waiting to get paid so I can go see #PetSematary and The Curse of #LaLlorona"
"21","They always underestimate the showing power of minority audiences. They did the same with Little last week"
"22","Most disappointing about #LaLlorona other than its by the numbers nature is its inability to capture the essence of the myths of the Hispanic culture. The film feels like a watered down, Americanized take, never fully diving into that world despite a rich premise. 3/5 at best"
"23","Was hoping to get out a full review of #LaLlorona, but with moving tomorrow, no time. It’s well shot, but unbelievably formulaic, with a jump scare every other scene to where you become numb to the terror. The sort of film that makes me think this sub-genre is on its last legs"
"24","God, if I'd realized #LaLlorona was set in the Conjuring fiction, I wouldn't have wasted the money <U+0001F62D> Beyond mediocre, bland, and as fright-inducing as a loaf of stale white bread"
"25","In a life spent investigating paranormal activity, it doesn't seem that odd that Lorraine Warren died the weekend a Conjuring spinoff is released.  #TheConjuring #LaLlorona #horror"
"26","I'm not going to use the passing of Lorraine to promote my work(s), I will though, say go and watch #LaLlorona and #AnnabelleComesHome the Conjuring universe was inspired by her and Ed's work in the field and would be great to see their legacy live on in the public eye with them."
"27","All of you acting childish 
La Llorona is gonna come and get you 
#lallorona"
"28","The Curse of #LaLlorona is dreadfully dull, jumping from one cheap jump scare to the next like a sort of ""worst hits"" compilation of the Conjuring Universe's weakest points. Silver lining? It's well directed, which bodes well for the director's next movie: The Conjuring 3."

"40","Analyzing #LaLlorona is kind of like looking for the nutritional value in cotton candy.   At just 93 minutes, it efficiently does the trick. More jump scares per minute than any movie I can remember."
"41","@thehorrorchick @PixelElixir @lalloronamovie Oh, this is good news! 

It opens in the UK on May 3rd and I'm almost certain I'll be joining you in that minority.

"123","I'm no horror movie expert, but the biggest reason I liked this film is because #LaLlorona was in so many scenes. The heel was visible throughout the movie, rather than just 3 or 4 times. The movie was about the antagonist, who had LOTS of screen-time. Quite refreshing, honestly."

"201","Just saw  #LaLlorona, it was cute but it was whitewashed to me. This HISPANIC folktale should’ve been surrounded by a full Hispanic cast and I would’ve liked it placed in Mexico better. I give it a 4/10."

"205","The Curse of #LaLlorona is a great story with lots of potential that delivered in some aspects but not the most crucial. The film was still spectacular for what it was and will hopefully be an example of what can improve especially with such fantastic stories. I still enjoyed it!"

"211","Maybe I'm just out of it lately,  but I didn't even know #LaLlorona was even part of the Conjuring Universe. They are REALLY milking that shit for all it's worth,&amp; there's nothing but corn chunks left."

"219","Just watched #LaLlorona and I never screamed penedeja so many times in a movie"
"220","The way I was told of the folklore of La Llorona was that she walks alongside bodies of water and she will try to catch you and drown you not that she will attach herself to you. Maybe there are different versions but I didn't like that she attached herself. #LaLlorona"
"221","Anyone going to see #LaLlorona tonight? Let me know if it’s worth it"
"222","Actually really enjoyed @lalloronamovie it was creepy as hell and love how it connects to Conjuring Universe! Great work @michaelchaves #LALLORONA"

"231","So I watched The curse of La llorona tonight, &amp; it made me think of one question. What's really the difference between cultural appropriation vs cultural appreciation? I think this movie is on that thin line between both. #LaLlorona #deepthoughts"
"232","Bruh I’m mad that they didn’t put La Llorona’s iconic line “Donde estan mis hijos” that movie was disappointing I expected better since it was a conjuring type movie #LaLlorona"
"233","What kind of parents take their kids to go see #LaLlorona <U+0001F62B>"
"234","Went to see #LaLlorona tonight. If you’re wondering how it was, it’s basically the white people version."

"244","Man i don’t think y’all appriecate the extent for which La Llorona terrified Latino kids. My neighbor told us don’t play by the 605/10 fwy exchange bc of her.. im a grown man and still shiver a little driving by. <U+0001F629><U+0001F629> #LaLlorona"

"246","White people really be gentrifying cultures huh? #LaLlorona was nothing to what we expected"
"247","RT @iamkapilan: I was expecting Conjuring Priest Couple to kill her, and save the family from the curse. But, never mind. <U+0001F60C> ""The Curse of La Llorona(2019)"" is better than ""The Nun""

"288","Wasn’t a fan of #lallorona. They could have at least made it more similar to its Hispanic roots. The priest had the biggest accent when he was talking in Spanish. It was what I expected very Americanized."

"298","@BoxOffice Yeah same here but I think the nun was worse . At least #LaLlorona was complete story. One of the issue I had was it did not deal depth and in legend of #CurseofLaLlorona maybe they need to do research or have a Hispanic view to co write"

Very well done film!!"
"300","#LaLlorona was pretty good (nowhere near the actual #Conjuring movies) but way better than the first Annabelle and The Nun, so glad to see it did well.   Plus it’s crazy that this is the very first movie that Linda Cardellini is in a headlining role!"

Look at IT, it isn’t scary but the new script was phenomenal. Atmosphere and story mixed with imagery are all you need for a ghost story."

"376","@cineworld Just saw the Unlimited screening of #LaLlorona the latest on The Conjuring/Annabelle/The Nun universe. Oh boy what a great film and by far the best in that whole universe. Very creepy and great jump scares. Loved it! <U+0001F44D>"
"377","Is it worth seeing LA Llorona in the theaters? lol"
"378","It sucks that the film is apparently completely thematically vacant (and whitewashed, which probably isn't a coincidence.) #LaLlorona is a story with a ton of potential angles and undercurrents. It's a shame she's never gotten a good Hollywood appearance."
"379","man i hate movie with garbage kids literally everyone in La Llorona was fucking braindead it took the mum like 30 years to put together that MAYBE the crazy spooky ghost lady MIGHT be haunting her family and her kids had their arms n shit ripped off and went ""ah my imagination"""

"400","@keileykaiser Shazam is going do just fine. La llorona was garbage. There is a reason they didn't market it as part of the conjuring universe even though it's a part of it."
"401","The Curse Of La Llorona - narratively half-baked and thematically repetitive.  A disappointing entry in The Conjuring universe. Could have done with a bit more Raymond Cruz too. Ta-da! 4/10."
"402","I just saw The Curse of La Llorona for #MovieOption. The only part really worth seeing was Poor Man's Benicio Del Toro."
"403","La llorona was really the worst movie ever lmaooo"
"404","These Conjuring Universe spinoffs are super paint by the numbers formulaic. This one was that and even went for older tropes. A guy literally said, “La Llorona. Haven’t heard that name in years.” <U+0001F602>

Still, had some fun with it."

"420","@michaelchaves Not from a place of mean spirited criticism, but support: I’m sure you can do better than this. Your visuals told me so. I really hope Conjuring 3 redeems this."
"421","If Conjuring 3 is all-around superior to Thr Curse Of La Llorona in the writing and suspense department, I will make my best attempt to be first in line with thorough praise and appreciation."
"422","I want a #LaLlorona movie where she's after the families of ICE agents &amp; the people responsible for taking Mexican children from their parents. A movie about the real horror of having your children torn away from you &amp; speaks to the experience of the culture La Llorona belongs to"
"423","@MarkHudiburg @laloalcaraz @wbpictures @lalloronamovie Not everyone identifies as Latino/a. Latinx is a gender-neutral term. Also see: Chicanx. I have heard it used both in conversation and online, as well as academically, though I can't say when/where it started. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> I'm sure Google can provide more info."
"424","Seriously though this is still so ludicrous. My bro, my dude, you heard some mom yelling about La Llorona just two weeks ago when the kids were running wild at the post-mass potluck, don't front."
"425","So I watched La Llorona &amp; I have a lot of thoughts, but foremost among them is that the lack of Latinx writers on it is no more glaringly obvious than when Tony Amendola's character, a priest in a Latinx neighborhood, says he hasn't heard the name of La Llorona 'since childhood'."
"426","Also, if I get it right, the main character is a non-Latina formerly married to a Latino who was apparently never involved in his kid's lives while alive, and she literally never heard him say 'Behave or La Llorona will get you!'"
"427","Also, they basically turn La Llorona into another Nun character. It's effective as jump scare fodder, but it is such a huge missed opportunity to craft something really memorable and steeped in proper culture/foklore."
"428","Also also why couldn't they cast a Latinx actress as the MC. Just. Why. And also, why couldn't it be set in Mexico? The Nun was set in Little Village Romania and had a lot of success, but La Llorona had to be set in America??"
"429","I wanna go see la llorona, suck being on house arrest"
"430","I can't wait to see this movie @michaelchaves at my @AMCTheatres spring 10 location next Monday @lalloronamovie looks like a awesome movie I'm excited to see it"

"563","To be fair to @lalloronamovie , they did not brown face Linda’s character/role but did center th story around her as a white female. Same old stuff. Also no Mexican-Americans or Latinos were involved in writing /directing it, but they did supposedly hire a Curandero consultant"
"564","@laloalcaraz @lalloronamovie And according to the articles, the curandero they got wad Cuban, not Mexican, and sounds like he was the only one who called back because the others they contacted were offended at the cultural appropriation."

"571","So wow, yeah, CURSE OF LA LLORONA is a pile of ass. Lousy version of what should be a lay-up ghost movie, about 90% of the problems come from obviously trying to ""De-Mexicanize"" a fundamentally Mexican folklore monster."

"627","#LaLlorona is a promising concept that falls short. Good cast, solid directing, and good design of the titular villain. Where the film disappoints is in it's script. I felt The Nun knew it was hamming it up but this film was trying to he serious and sadly missed the mark."

"793","Locals thought The Curse of La Llorona was terrifying and a good movie"
"794","@danielortberg Literally my favorite part of going to the movies is stuff like this. Last night we saw Curse of La Llorona and (SPOILER) she got defeated. A solid 15 seconds after she ""dies"" and we're in a quiet wrap up scene the guy behind us goes ""YEA!!!"""
"795","My showing is 59 minutes #LaLlorona"
"796","The Curse Of La Llorona is about as good as you'd expect. Jumpscares galore and a villain that gets old quickly. Also a random comic relief character halfway through the movie for some reason???"
"797","“yOu CaN gUEsS wHaT HaPpEnS nExT” Bullshit it was still a really good movie! I’m a scary movie kind of gal &amp; I’d watch it again bc it got me a few times!! Everyone has the own opinion, if you want to watch it WATCH IT! Don’t ask other people’s opinion bc they won’t have the same"
"798","Kinda disappointed that the horror movie La Llorona is in theaters now and I still have not heard it incorporated into a “My Sharona” song parody.
The internet has let me down.

"799","“ The curse of la Llorona “ was shittt. They could of done better tbh, 1/ 10? I give it a 6 <U+0001F60F>"
"800","Tryna smoke a fat ass wood and watch La Llorona <U+0001F643>"
"801","My dad said who wants to watch “la llorona?” And everyone said yeah so i guess we going to watch it at the theaters rn <U+0001F62D>"
"802","Alright. I’m finna watch this La Llorona movie. If I don’t get scared like how I did when I would hear my grandma’s and grandpa’s stories from the Pueblo, imma have to get my money back."
"803","Okay so the movie wasn’t terrible but I grew up on the folk stories from the elders so I had a different point of view/expectation for the story line. Parts of it didn’t make sense according to the legend of la llorona. Overall I give it a 6/10."
"804","Also with such a lore of La Llorona at their feet more could have been done than just the usual ghost scares - there was so much potential wasted. With that said, there is a lot of positives to take from the film."
"805","Just watched The Curse of La Llorona. I liked it but didn’t love it. To me, it had the same issues as The Nun. The film running time is 93 minutes, and just like The Nun, it needed at least another 20 to 30 minutes to add a little more depth."
"806","Overall, while not my favorite of the year, nor close to how good Conjuring 1 and 2 and Annabelle: Creation are, The Curse of La Llorona is worth at least a watch."
"807","I really want to go watch la llorona"
"808","My whole family and I went to see The Curse of La Llorona and we laughed the whole time<U+0001F480><U+0001F602>"

"846","Can every site stop forcing the trailer of that La Llorona thing? I’m trying to sleep tonight"
"847","I’m not allowing myself to go see #LaLlorona in theatres because I tried to watch the trailer and couldn’t get through it due to the fact that I was laughing too hard thinking about @chrisdelia and that stupid video he made about it. That’s alllllallorna."

"864","Mental note: La Llorona= the weeping woman"
"865","The Curse of La Llorona was ok at best. I would give it a 5/10. There was too many loose ends and the ending felt weak. It would have been a lot scarier if they used the myth to play with your mind more instead of throwing jump scares in every other scene"
"866","Watched La llorona movie today and I don’t want to get out of bed that’s how pussy I am"

"910","The Curse Of La Llorona was surprisingly good. Although the ending execution of the villain was very bland, the movie created a very eerie and dark atmosphere that allowed the movie to stand out that much more. Although it felt short in a way, its still a very good watch."
"911","The curse of la llorona was definitely  one of the worst movies I have ever watched"

"921","This movie had potential all the way up till the end. Lmao oooookay. I predicted the whole movie. The man is a vampire slayer, and the actor that plays the priest loves being a priest on screen... You’ll find him very familiar."
"922","@Jawnsky_ @gdickey16 @SvintGeek @lalloronamovie Not enough story or background on la llorona, and to many unnecessary jump scares literally one scene explaining her story when there’s so much more to it ... predictable horror movie ..."

"935","@MzSassiness I feel you. There's nothing like a good horror movie! I'm just so disappointed in creators of the last decade and a half cause they been failing so miserably at it. I saw The Curse of La Llorona today tho, that shit was solid. Not spectacular but very entertaining."
