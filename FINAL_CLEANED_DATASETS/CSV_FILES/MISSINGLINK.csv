"2","@LAIKAStudios has made another wonderful adventure with Missing Link. It seems almost a miracle these films exist. Go see it."
"3","I love Laika but hate hate HATE its reputation as being the ""creepy kids movie"" studio. Every comment I see on Facebook posts about Missing Link is all ""uhhhh why is it not creepy like coraline? Not interested!"" and that makes me sad"
"4","Saw Missing Link. Visually stunning, but not great."
"5","So, this week, Hellboy, Little, and Missing Link came out to theaters. Me? I went and saw #AfterMovie 

I watched One Direction fan fiction that was revamped.  I WATCHED FAN FICTION!!!

I bring this on myself."
"6","@the_cinemabliss It is the right choice. Missing Link is delightful!"
"7","I need the Air Max Missing Link Susan's in a size 13 when people get them in hand and the price drops.

This is my vision.

Holler when you got em."
"8","Missing Link looks cute! I think I need to support my friend and see it soon."
"9","@kirkneverdied Are you going to be checking out Missing Link this weekend? I thought it was really good!!"
"10","@theBurk3nator Hope you get around to seeing Missing Link I thought it was great!! As for Hellboy I had no interest once I saw the trailers"

"12","I actually agree with people claiming it's the audience fault for Disney ruining cinema, because it is their fault

You got a great original film like Missing Link, which likely won't make any money

But y'all will give money to fucking Dumbo"
"13","Honestly, Missing Link might be one of the most progressive/woke movies I’ve seen recently"
"14","@Kev_Dies_Twice Also we have AMC Stubs and High Life doesn’t seem to be playing at any nearby AMC. I’m just happy I saw Missing Link yesterday."
"15","Missing Link was great. Just a super pretty, incredibly fun old fashioned adventure comedy with just enough heart to hold it together."
"16","Lights come up on Missing Link and I start walking out. Two people are basically having sex in the back row. 

Sick world we live in."
"17","Another winner for @LAIKA Missing Link continues the hit of winners from Coraline, ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls, and my all-time favorite Kubo and the Two Strings. I've yet to be disappointed in #LAIKA Studios; please keep up the excellent work."
"18","Missing Link is so much fun and, as always, the animation by @LAIKAStudios is clever and gorgeous!!! Very extra silly and lovely and well-voiced. We had a great time watching it for date night, but also great for families. Go see this movie!!! #MustSee #MovieNight #MissingLink"
"19","Missing Link is an absolutely lovely film. It has beautiful animations, likeable characters, and a heartwarming message for all. I left the theater with a smile on my face. 84/100"
"20","Just got back from watching the new movie Missing Link. Story is a bit tarnished, but the visuals are spectacular. Highly recommend watching."
"21","Just saw @LAIKAStudios ‘s Missing Link. It’s a super fun film that shows once again how incredible stop motion can be. I can’t hype it enough; please go see it!"
"22","1. Coraline
2. Kubo and the Two Strings
3. ParaNorman
4. Missing Link
5. The Boxtrolls

But they’re all baseline nice"
"23","Seeing Missing Link because I’ve mindhacked myself into thinking Laika is ethical capitalism"
"24","Missing Link is fine, charming even! Closer to Boxtrolls than Coraline but it’s still good to have Laika in the world making movies that look this good."
"25","If the Missing Link crowd is anything to go by, the Dora the Explorer movie is also going sucker punch the box office."
"26","I'm going to see Missing Link on Sunday."
"27","I find Missing Link to be a good/fun movie and the Sasquash if a friendly/lovable guy. He he reminds me of Rusty!"
"28","@TheUnipiper how did I not know your pipes made an appearance in @LAIKAStudios “Missing Link”?! That’s fantastic! My sister is a 2nd Assistant Director on that film!! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F> to Portland!"
"29","Just got out of Missing Link sadly only 3 Families were there"
"30","@Animated_Antic I saw Missing Link today it was great the trailers I got I got The Lion King Frozen 2 secret life of pets 2 in the most anticipated movie of all time Uglydolls"
"31","Missing Link is off to a terrible start on Friday with about 1.6 million dollars with a extra 230K on Thursday nights and 1.1 Million International WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE"
"32","You've gotta be kidding me. Theres a 3RD YETI CARTOON MOVIE IN A ROW? (Smallfoot, Missing Link, Abominable)"
"33","Missing Link is fun and subtly suggests children ignore gender norms, which is *a* step for big screen animation, if only a very small one."
"34","@Film_lust @ArrowFilmsVideo Seems you've had a good day too. Had an excellent time with ""Missing Link"" found the expensive ""Smash Bros. Melee"" for 2$ and I got the 2K restoration of ""The Great Silence"" along with the highly chaotic race film ""RedLine"" that I have been trying to find for some time."
"35","@SebAnimation1 Missing Link is also in the tricky position of being distributed by Annapurna. I love Annapurna and their track record with producing quality films is high, but they're floundering on distribution. Their movies are flopping, with MGM keeping them afloat."
"36","@SebAnimation1 If anything, we should celebrate that Laika wants to tell different kinds of stories. That Chris Butler directed and wrote both Missing Link and ParaNorman shows his versatility as a filmmaker."
"37","I check into the cinema to watch Missing Link and Duo Lingo sends a notification like, ‘bitch why you at the movies it’s time to learn Welsh! Is that a Welsh language film? What are you going to do if someone needs to know if the cat has a harp at the hospital?"
"38","@MMandOscar Not to mention the original movies so far (not speaking to quality, but glad to see them made): Glass, Serenity, Alita: Battle Angel, Us, Missing Link, The Beach Bum, Alone/Together, Velvet Buzzsaw, Paddleton, Unicorn Store, Polar... 2019 is fascinating to say the least."
"39","Missing Link is stop motion fantastic. Dry humor bemusement. Furry delight? Lovely done right. It's the animated euphoria. The Big Foot dysphoria. 

It's good. See it."
"40","Missing Link was as wonderful, charming, and creative as I expected!! Please go give Laila’s new movie a watch. They’re a wonderful company with hope for creative original movies in the future... and not constant remakes!!!"
"41","It’s better than BoxTrolls, but not as good as Coraline, ParaNorman, or Kubo.

Those three really stand out as Laika’s best overall. While Missing Link is a visual treat, it is light on story. A fun story nonetheless."
"42","I am a big fan of the Laika movies, but I haven't paid attention to Missing Link. Dunno. 

Kubo and the Two Strings has been my favorite visuals wise, but Coraline has been my favorite story wise. The others have been good too."
"43","Tonight we went to see a movie (The Missing Link) at a ludicrously upscale movie theater &amp; it turns out that my taste for luxury has its limits."
"44","In non Star Wars news: Missing Link is really good and I worry it’s not gonna get the attention it deserves"
"45","Missing Link was a total experience I needed in my life. I am dead set in supporting it and making sure everyone I know gets to watch it! I have to show my gratitude in a drawing soon!!

#Laika #MissingLink #Bigfoot"
"46","Watched Missing Link and it was okay. Probably the second weakest of Laika Studios' film library (only ahead of Boxtrolls), which look at the other three films Laika did and don't consider it that huge an insult."
"47","Saw Missing Link! I promise it’s better than it looks (Laika trailers are never good.) The animation and cinematography were especially impressive too. Go see it!!!<U+0001F9B6>"
"48","@LAIKAStudios My favorite part of Missing Link™<U+FE0F> by LAIKAStudios™<U+FE0F> is the part where Hugh Jackman and Zach Galifinakis eat each others’ butts in the middle of a snowstorm"
"49","hey @ArtByHornbuckle you might approve of the Missing Link movie. For uh... obvious reasons."
"50","@RyanSheebs I'm also bummed that Captain Marvel still demolished The Missing Link, but alas, I expected it - it's a Laika film. :("
"51","Sad news: ""Missing Link"" is currently tanking at the box office. On pace to open in the bottom half of top ten, with about HALF of the $12.6M opening for ""Kubo,"" which was the previous low for a Laika film."
"52","Missing Link's art design is STUNNING. The sets and environments are beautiful (LOVED the colors in the forest) and the character designs are super charming. I can't believe how smooth the animation is for stop-motion."
"53","If Missing Link doesn't turn into a tv show, im gunna be angery"
"54","@Motherplayer @ArrowFilmsVideo Result!  I am hearing a lot of pleasant things about Missing Link. I always trust your judgment, so i will definitely be giving it a go. <U+0001F44D>"
"55","Just saw Missing Link. It was really fun! There was sadly no tsuchinoko, but there was one surprise cryptid I was very happy to see."
"56","@hoover_wind @RenfamousX You know what?...I might go see 'Missing Link'........jeez!"
"57","I’d rate ‘Missing Link’ a 6/10. 
Decent movie."
"58","I’m absolutely gutted that Missing Link isn’t 3D. I thought Hell Boy too for sure. How will I survive!"
"59","I actually enjoyed Missing Link, it was funny n a cute ass story"
"60","@cineworld is it possible to watch both Missing Link at 12:50 and Shazam at 2:30 today in Eastbourne? Trying to decide what to book!"
"61","@LGTHBlog As far as films go, tomorrow might either go see Shazam, Mid90s, Wild Rose or Missing Link. Curious about whether or not I'll like Wild Rose since, although it's different genre, I wasn't a fan of Buckley's previous film Beast from last year. She had a fine performance..."
"62","@Marcus_Gomezz @cineworld I really enjoyed Missing Link. Compared with Wonder Park I preferred it to the latter.

Hoping Little is good. Have liked what I've seen so far."
"63","@cineworld Missing Link was my favourite of the four followed by Shazam. However, the burial sets in Pet Cemetary looked like they were filmed on an old Star Wars stages ... not good <U+0001F633>"
"64","@_clxtchzillaa_ It’s based on that “Missing Link” kids movie. The Sasquatch character wears a jacket and pants combo looking like this."

"66","Love hearing Stompin Tom in @thordiakow's review of Missing Link. I might have missed the entire review thanks to Tom though. #sorrythor"
"67","I’m probably more excited to be watching Laika’s Missing Link than any of the kids in the cinema #bigkid #nevergrowup"
"68","Really admire Missing Link's craft, and Laika's traditional storytelling values - none of the obnoxious sass that plagues modern family films - but found the film flat compared to the exceptional Kubo."
"69","Suppose to be seeing Missing Link soon this week <U+0001F60D>"
"70","@JadeScottSavage Hi Jade! Really glad to hear that you're enjoying Missing Link! It's a handsome poster too huh? Are going to watch it a fourth time?"
"71","Missing Link grossed an estimated $1.61M on Friday.

#MissingLink  #BoxOffice  @AnnapurnaPics  @LAIKAStudios"
"72","@horrorflicktab @testpatternshow Still, I might see it again (after I see Missing Link). As for Harbour's version of Hellboy, it's okay. Not as reflective as the comic, not as noble as Perlman. This version of Broom is the worst, though. I hate it so much. He's such a macho prick."
"73","@DinaPugliese Hey D, just seeing what's playing this weekend and you've seen Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Shazam, and Missing Link. You're a beast! Lol #MyHero #DoItLikeDina"
"74","Missing Link is the Speed Racer of 2019"
"75","New movies on #hdmotv

Missing Link (2019) CAM
After (2019 CAM)
Shazam! (2019) Now in TS quality"
"76","So today's @cineworld viewings:
Wild Rose (5/5)
Missing Link (4/5 and family friendly)
Hellboy (2.5/5 maybe 3 with a couple beers and friends on home release)"
"77","Right, Missing Link done, rather wonderful family film which keeps up this run @LAIKAStudios seems to have! Definitely one to take the kids to over the Easter holidays!"
"78","Might check out Missing Link next week in cinemas."
"79","@dakotalanthimos Laika is An amazing Animation studio with their own unique of animation that separates apart from Disney and DreamWorks.
However, many people I know who have seen Missing Link say they liked the animation but the story was not top tier storytelling."
"80","Please... PLEASE watch Missing Link, be it by yourself or with everyone you can drag along for a wholesome experience. @LAIKAStudios really did an awesome job (as always)."
"81","@tonydibbin Preferred Missing Link to be honest with you"
"82","@mvbrat91 Instead of wasting money on HINO, I’ve decided to either see Jordan Peele’s Us or Laika’s newest Missing Link. Still debating."
"83","Please note -  Missing Link at 11.30am tomorrow morning will be featuring Subtitles.

The following subtitled screening will be -
 Shazam (12a) on Thursday 18th April at 5.15pm.
@yourlocalcinema"
"84","Ouch. Missing Link is a huge flop. I didn't think it would do well since the main character design is repulsive looking, but I didn't think it'd do worse than Wonder Park. #boxoffice"
"85","Oh, right.

Did anyone check out Missing Link yet?

Unfortunate that LAIKA is not marketing that film a lot, similar to Kubo.

Hope to see it soon."
"86","@LGTHBlog Trying to see Missing Link today."
"87","Missing Link:

Somehow Laika manages to blow Kubo and the Two Strings out of the water in terms of animation/production. I only wish the story had been a bit stronger. Still, if this is Laika's last animated film, as Travis Knight has stated, then they're going out with a bang."
"88","I can't believe how many sets were made for Missing Link. Especially with such detail and color."
"89","@floaty_uravity @westanallmight Why don't we go see Missing Link? I have yet to hear much about it, but it was produced by the wonderful people at Laika Studios! To think they produce such breathtaking animation without using quirks!"
"90","Taking my mom out to see the new Laika movie, Missing Link today. It’ll be my first time seeing one of their movies in theaters so I’m definitely looking forward to it."
"91","Just went to see Missing Link which was brilliant. And so great to see @WarwickJC in the credits. One of my favourite artists and a bloody lovely human."
"92","Seriously, if Laika shuts down, it will be a heartbreaking loss in modern animation. See Missing Link!"
"93","@untypicalboro Kids enjoyed Missing Link at the pictures. Good story lovingly told and rendered"
"94","The super-duper-early box office estimates are embarrassingly low for Missing Link, which is kind of disappointing. Each time Laika releases a film, the box office numbers are lower, and I dread the day when they'll have to close. Support this studio!"
"95","@gabrielroth We’ve just seen The Missing Link. I had a little sleep."
"96","@AfterAddic They are and I even looked up some stuff. The movie Missing Link (even though it is a different genre, it is targeted toward a bigger audience and has better RT reviews) was in 1,000 more theaters in the US than After, and made $1 million less. People can calm down."
"97","I feel like not a lot has been said about Missing Link. But I just came out of it and while it’s not perfect I’ve enjoyed it so much more than a lot of better reviewed/more talked about films from the past years. 
It’s so charming and sweet and absolutely gorgeous"
"98","I love the vibrancy of Missing Link, it looks amaaazing!!"
"99","the theater for Missing Link is entirely empty I'm scared"
"100","@ScottMendelson @Forbes Missing Link was also crippled by horrid marketing- I have NO idea if the movie is decent or not, but I'd sit PRAYING for the damn trailer to end every time I saw it.
My kids laughed AT it -not WITH- it, &amp; noone else in the theaters seemed impressed either.
Marketing will getcha!"
"101","Missing Link was an amazing movie! I really love how they made the movie."
"102","Honestly I spent a year or more talking shit about Missing Link but I just got home from the theater and it was so good. The only bad part of the movie was the marketing. It’s not what you expect at all. Super good."
"103","Please go see Missing Link, it is SO cute and the animation is breathtaking, as is the standard for LAIKA movies."
"104","@SinemiaSupport @SinemiaSupport I have a very upset 6 year old and a wife celebrating her birthday who are going to miss seeing The Missing Link today if you can’t get your app fixed within an hour.  Epic Fail Sinemia.  Left Movie Pass for this very reason.  Will not renew!"
"105","At theatre with the kiddos watching Missing Link (cute, if you’re wondering). After coming back from the shock of a $66 charge at the concession stand, I love this family time and love that my 18 year old still wants to hang with us. <U+2764><U+FE0F> #anotherdayali #lfamily #momlife #parenting"
"106","@Anpumon Missing Link is not even showing in my area, I am grumpy about thAt"
"107","@OrangeGrove55 I haven’t seen Missing Link yet (tomorrow, perhaps) but the box office numbers make me sad. The amount of time and craft that goes into these films is astounding."
"108","Today’s aesthetic is watching Missing Link in a nearly empty theatre whilst drinking a large Powerade Zero."
"109","Missing Link looked less appealing than other Laika films so I'm not surprised its opening is going to be so low."
"110","@cinemaxwell @smilingldsgirl Truth! I loved Kubo and Missing Link was a pleasant surprise:)"
"111","Why is Missing Link doing so poorly?  Because of Shazam?"
"112","I just saw The Missing Link in theaters today and it was an awesome movie."
"113","Think I'm going to go see The Missing Link today."
"114","@mousterpiece @Archibald_H I admire what they do very much, but Missing Link doesn't look interesting  to me, unfortunately. I absolutely  loved Kubo. Laika has a lot of artistry, but I think their writing quality isn't consistent. I won't ever tell someone not to watch this film though!"
"115","At the theater for Missing Link and Hellboy."
"116","Just got home from seeing Missing Link, it was a great movie!"
"117","What other podcast will give you this kinda range?!
Especially since we’re talking Missing Link this weekend."
"118","Missing Link has a High Rating on @RottenTomatoes"
"119","Missing Link - It always saddens me when a stop-motion film isn't very good. Loads of people spent buckets of time making it, but the end result was rather flat and a little bit boring. Such a shame. 2 stars."
"120","Once more, as the weekend arrives: if you like engaging, well-animated, entertaining family fare, you need to see Missing Link."
"121","Was gonna see Missing Link today, but the weather is too crap to drive in"
"122","I've been really depressed lately so I've decided to have fun today. I’m gonna wear really outrageous earrings and eat lasagna and go see Missing Link and Shazam AND MAYBE EVEN A THIRD FILM IF I FEEL LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN AND I WILL BE HAPPY DAMMIT"
"123","I really don’t want Laika to go out of business bc I love the look &amp; craft of their films but I really have zero desire to see Missing Link. 
I don’t really want to go watch a movie I won’t enjoy just to support a studio I like...."
"124","@Chris_Stuckmann Wanted to hear thoughts on Missing Link. I saw it today and found the story average. Wanted to hear your take since you admired Laika Animation and their movies"
"125","Missing Link is bombing and honestly I’m not surprised. It’s 2019 and Laika is still relying on a “look at how impressive our animation is” mentality to market their movies. Modern audiences do not care about stop motion. They need better ways to advertise their movies than this"
"126","@Smintytv After, Little, Missing Link and Hellboy in that order LOL I have amc a-list which let's me see 3 movies a week for $20 a month in any format <U+0001F440>"
"127","Missing Link is absolutely lovely <U+0001F970>Laika treats me nice."
"128","'Shazam!'
Fun Superhero adventure has humour and heart

Niall's Verdict - 4/5 stars

'Missing Link'
Beautifully animated stop motion escapade has old fashioned charm

Niall's Verdict - 3/5 stars"
"129","@CineSportsTalk We missed this screening. We never complain about free. The audience always claps and cheers at the end, at bad movies (Missing Link)"
"130","(hot take: Disney (along with poorly executed marketing) is responsable for Missing Link’s failing box office)"
"131","Missing Link is my last hope to see a good movie this weekend. Little, After, and Hellboy have made for one of the worst wide release weekends in some time."
"132","I need to watch Missing Link"
"133","The Missing Link live action, out now"
"134","@AMCTheatres my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I went to go see a movie today and all of your Mango Missing Link slushee machines were not working. #shareamc"
"135","Got most of my tax stuff done so I'm going to see Missing Link tonight!"
"136","@PostCreditScene In 'Missing Link', there isn't a credits scene per say. But after the first part of the credits, they showed how they made a particular sequence in a time-lapse."
"137","Missing Link was everything I like... Smart, funny and beautiful. If you’re remotely interested, you’ll really enjoy it.  (Stay thru the credits for another peak behind Laika’s curtain. It’s mind-boggling!)"
"138","imo it wasn’t advertised as well as it could’ve been, but it’s been a struggle for any Laika movie that’s not “creepy.” I only saw one Kubo trailer during any of the lead up to release, but that one was beautiful and intriguing. The Missing Link ones felt very run of the mill..."
"139","I saw the new Laika movie Missing Link today and it was wonderful and beautiful as Laika always produces please see it and support Laika’s amazing work"
"140","#UnpopularOpinion: Laika edition

-Coraline is boring af, I fall asleep everytime i start watching it.

-i like Paranorman, it drags on a bit during the 3rd act but still good.

-i have not seen boxtrolls or kubo.

- interested in seeing Missing Link."
"141","@cartoonbrew I love Laika, but they are a victim of audience expectations for what stop motion “should” be—as in something you would have seen in Hot Topic circa 2005. Coraline, Paranorman (and even Boxtrolls) fit it. Kubo and Missing Link don’t. 

It rough to try to grow a stylistic genre."
"142","I thoroughly enjoyed Missing Link. The 6 pre-teenagers who were the only other patrons, left before the first half hour was up. It's not that the humour is adult, but it can only be appreciated by paying close attention. The animation is top notch and the voice cast are excellent"
"143","After is (finally) over. Missing Link is up next. #Movies <U+0001F39E><U+0001F39F><U+0001F3AC>"
"144","@waterboy4hire Coraline and Kubo are the best of Laika imo. Still want to see Missing Link."
"145","Who’s going to see Missing Link?"
"146","Missing Link made $1.6 million on Friday, and won't top $6 for its opening weekend. This is why we can't have nice things. You don't get to complain about how boring American animation is if you don't support the good stuff on the rare occasions we get it."
"147","Ok the Missing Link DLC part of Human Revolution is one the worst parts of the game not including the boss fights"
"148","The Missing Link was a movie full of “men ain’t shit, they are colonizers and killers,” so I obviously loved it,"
"149","@STEVE_TRUMPENCE I, I , I, say your Son is right. Missing Link Ish . Like what came first Chicken or The Egg. Definitely History Channel Stuff."
"150","Saw ""Missing Link"" earlier today and thought it was pretty good and comical. Plus finished ""A Silent Voice"" and it was beautiful, honestly it made me feel more than ""Your Name"" (no tears though)."
"151","I really wanted to see Missing Link this weekend to support it at the box office but I’m out of town for a family wedding."
"152","@AMCTheatres - ""Missing Link""s 2.35 aspect ratio was incorrectly masked to 1.85 at Washington DC's Uptown screen - very disappointing"
"153","Go see Missing Link. Support Laika and stop-motion animation."
"154","So I needed to get out of the house to stop myself from excessively stressing about school so guess who spontaneously went to see Missing Link."
"155","Anyway yeah please go see Missing Link! Its a fun time and its worth it to support stop-motion animation as an artform!"
"156","Missing Link spoilers (I guess)

Jesus fuck I sighed so hard inside when they avoided a dumb arbitrary kiss at the end"
"157","@roboplato Watch the Missing Link instead"
"158","@LAIKAStudios getting ready to watch Missing Link! I live your studio"
"159","Has anyone seen Missing Link yet? Going to catch it tomorrow morning and I'm hoping it lives up to the hype. Laika is great after all."
"160","Just got back from ""Missing Link"". Funnier than I expected, an allegory of the slipping grip of violent white men on world affairs. For parents (@ShanelleLittle,@KeneshaisDope) nothing much to worry about for younguns. A couple of puns that will fly over a little kid's head."
"161","Shaq proves he is the King of nicknaming.  Kyle Lowry = The Missing Link."
"162","If you get a chance, please go watch Missing Link. It's such a wholesome fun adventure film with some beautiful animation. @LAIKAStudios continues to make show why their one of the best in the animation. #MissingLink"
"163","finished watching the Missing Link.  It's a lot of fun, funny and I really enjoyed the stop motion animation.  if you like the classic adventure touring around the world you'll enjoy it"
"164","@_HuntingFloof <U+0001F496> I mean

"176","Sadly, you can pretty much replace 'Missing Link' with any Laika movie and the headline holds true.

"183","I've been replaying the Deus Ex games, starting with Human Revolution (Director's Cut) and, uh... wow. Wow, I do not enjoy The Missing Link DLC. It grinds the whole story to a halt and feels like I'm playing an entirely different game."
"184","Honestly confused at Missing Link's poor performance. It seemed to get plenty of advertising and seemed accessible enough to a general audience. Interested to see how this all plays out."
"185","@cinemaxwell I don’t see many trailers in general, but I haven’t seen any for Missing Link pop up anywhere other than by animation enthusiasts here and on YouTube, so that could be a reason. For me it’s that I barely ever go to the movies in general."
"186","It pains me to think that Laika (the company behind ""Kubo and the Two Strings,"" ""Coraline"") could either fold or merge with how poorly ""Missing Link"" is fixing to perform. Their model of going after teens and more mature young kids is exceptional, but the outlook is grim."
"187","So I’ve just finished the Missing Link, so here’s my review:
Story: 8/10

"191","The movie Missing Link is so good :,)"
"192","@davechensky Dude I’m always heartbroken about Laika movies because they are always brilliant. Coraline, Kubo... some of my favorite animated movies in years. I wish folks would show up for movies like these. I’m excited to see Missing Link"
"193","Just wanna say that what's happening with Missing Link is pretty much what happened with Shaun the Sheep Movie in the US along with Early Man, so I'll be advertising the hell out of the sequel."
"194","We just got out of Missing Link and it was incredible

The story was good and I liked the characters but the animation quality was fucking phenomenal. It's was an hour and half long flex fest by all of Laika

Don't let the bad trailer fool you. Please go see it in theaters"
"195","I was almost interested in Missing Link

"197","@KevinRBrackett @HellboyMovie @aftermovie @LAIKAStudios @marsaimartin Just watched Little, loved it, I laughed so hard...Issa Rae was delightful. Hoping to see Missing Link soon"
"198","I want to go watch Missing Link, but I'm afraid it might trigger memories of Harry and the Hendersons... one of the saddest movies I've ever watched."
"199","Please see Missing Link... it’s a really fun film <U+0001F5A4><U+2728>"
"200","Hugh Jackman's voice acting and the animation for his character made Missing Link worth watching all by themselves."
"201","I wanna go see Missing Link in theatres with my mom soon, heck."
"202","Reral Movie News: Shazam should be #1. Hellboy (with no Del Toro) only about $13m. Little ($15m) and After($8m) are both going to end up making money eventually so those numbers are not bad. Missing Link animation style is very cool but fails to catch on in US and will do $6m"
"203","Everyone please go see Missing Link its so fucking good and the ankmation IS STUNNNNNING <U+0001F31F><U+0001F496>"
"204","I say this having seen Kubo, Coraline, Corpse Bride, Paranorman, and Missing Link"
"205","I knew Missing Link was gonna flop because of lack of marketing, but damn this really hits me hard. Stop motion is a beautiful medium and its sad to see this not be a success."

"207","I wanna watch The Missing Link so bad"
"208","I know everyone in the Laika fandom was really skeptical about The Missing Link but I thought it was really cute, SUPER funny, and very original. I think everyone who sees it will find at least one thing in the movie they’ll love.  PLEASE go see it!!!"
"209","Missing Link is gorgeous and full of charm. Well done, @LAIKAStudios friends!"
"210","Missing Link Only Made 5.8 million with Worldwide of 7 million I can't find a budget yet but there gonna take a huge lose WHAT IS WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU"
"211","@Toon4Thought @Animated_Antic I go see all the animated movies and I will be seeing Uglydolls in a few weeks and I have gotten that trailer before Lego Movie I've gotten it before How to Train Your Dragon wonderpark Dumbo (even though that's not animated I still went to go see that) and Missing Link"
"212","@raul_alcantar8 1. Lego Movie 2
2. Missing Link 
3. The Hidden World"
"213","Hey now that @LAIKAStudios  has 5 movies I can do a top 5. It'll be the easiest top 5 I've ever done.
1. Coraline
2. Kubo and the Two Strings
3. Missing Link
4. Boxtrolls
5. ParaNorman"
"214","@cvw220 I saw Shazam!, Missing Link, Little, and Hellboy this week. They were all pretty good."
"215","@Clptp I think Kubo is much more a piece with Coraline and ParaNorman than boxtrollls was or Missing Link is going to be so idk what else to conclude that the offending party's problem is the representation in that movie"
"216","Never gave my thought on the movies earlier. Missing Link was fun. Better than Kubo (and especially Box Trolls). About on par with Paranorman."
"217","Just watched Missing Link by Laika! It was such a beautiful movie and the environments...! AMAZING<U+0001F64C><U+2728><U+2728>

"220","I just realized I don't think we're getting Missing Link in Mexican cinemas. We didnt get Us either I'm so frustrated and sad <U+0001F62D>"
"221","Missing Link is getting good critical reviews???"
"222","There’s literally no in between. Coraline, Paranorman, and Kubo are all masterpieces and I’ve heard good things about Missing Link but Boxtrolls feels like an especially bad Dreamworks movie. Like Bee Movie or Shark Tale."
"223","Oh jeezes, Laika is possibly gonna go bankrupt isn't it?
They flopped with Kubo and now Missing Link isn't doing too hot. The film industry is cruel to those that are unique and stray away from what's safe."
"224","If film twitter and cinefiles cared more about animation then stop motion animated features wouldn’t have such a hard time at box office. Also Missing Link is a really solid film don’t miss out. It really needs some love."
"225","@KevinRBrackett @HellboyMovie @aftermovie @LAIKAStudios @marsaimartin This dormant pre-Holy Week/Easter movie season in the Philippines.
I would want to watch The Missing Link so badly.
Hope Ayala Malls Cinemas @ILoveSureSeats (@TrinomaTweets &amp; @UP_TownCenter) would not pull out this movie this Monday or Tuesday."
"226","@SirPTF24 @MarvelousMrMad With Missing Link at least it’s about an animal that doesn’t exist so there doesn’t seem to be this problem."
"227","I should go see Missing Link tomorrow."
"228","@Klee_FilmReview I also thought Missing Link had a great trailer.  Chicken Run is the most successful stop-motion, which I do not get, and overseas Wallace and Gromit was a big deal. None of it makes sense to me, personally, and never did. I'll see things w/a low RT score if it intrigues me."
"229","The definitive Laika ranking:

ParaNorman
Coraline
Missing Link (very close to Coraline)
Kubo and the Two Strings
Boxtrolls"
"230","Theres a joke in Missing Link that I'm still laughing at

No I won't stop tweeting about it until everyones seen it"
"231","Can someone tell me how Missing Link has been received? I'm too scared to look at the reviews."
"232","Yo please watch Lailka’s the Missing Link. It’s a marvelous, and delightful film that deserves more attention. Can’t recommend enough!! #Laika #animation #TheMissingLink"
"233","@Toon4Thought @Animated_Antic I haven't seen The Missing Link yet (though I plan to in a few days ), though I think poor marketing and the movie being a big departure from what Laika is normally known for (horror) may have contributed to its financial shortcomings."
"234","So I just saw Missing Link. While it wasn't quite as fantastic as Kubo or Coraline, it was still really solid. The animation was so flawless I constantly forgot it was stop motion, the characters are charming, and it was one of Laika's more effective attempts at humor."

"241","@tynemouthsw I don't know whether to be appalled or mildly disturbed.
Could this be ""The Missing Link"" between ZX-81 and Spectrum @zxwife ?"
"242","Saw the new movie ""Missing Link "" with my daughter yesterday.  Very good movie,  I really enjoyed it."
"243","I've actually seen four films in the theatre recently. I really enjoyed Shazam! and Us. Pet Sematary was okay... Hellboy was awful.
I also only just discovered the existence of the film Missing Link, which I'm excited to go see on Tuesday!"
"244","@sexy_riker Just smuggle some cans in and come see Missing Link with me instead"
"245","Missing Link - A likeable if standard comedy-adventure film for the most part, then gets to some clever and brilliant things to think about that Laika films usually have. Really enjoyable when all is said and done."
"246","@immortanjill if you haven’t seen Missing Link, pls go see it bb"
"247","Missing Link was an absolute joy, Genuinely sweet, funny and a visual treat. 
Loved it."
"248","Someone should Photoshop @linklamont s face from any episode and tag it on a movie  picture poster of Missing Link maybe we c an have a Chain of Links  . BYMB"
"249","Just watched Missing Link. Great film with incredible animation."

"255","Missing Link is the best movie I've seen in 2019 so far and it is not close. Perfectly executed old-time adventure romp."
"256","Saw The Missing Link last night. And my what a beautiful film! The beginning is a tad slow yes. But it builds the story in a believable way. And the ANIMATION WAS PHENOMENAL! sometimes you forget you're watching stop motion animation!

definitely recommended! It's just so good!"
"257","I’ve seen every Laika movie since 2005 in theaters. So in tradition, I’m at the movies bright and early about to watch Missing Link! I’ll be back online later for sessions<U+0001F60E>"
"258","@my2k The underperformance of Wonder Park and Missing Link gives a bad signal to the studios that original films are no longer going to be successful and they have to rely on sequels or remakes of older animated films to find success."
"259","Missing Link debuted with an estimated $5.84M this weekend.

#MissingLink  #BoxOffice  @AnnapurnaPics  @LAIKAStudios"
"260","@ZakaZ96 @LoudCartoonist Missing Link was released 1 week after Shazam and 2 weeks before Avengers: Endgame. It is destined to bomb.
These movies fail because of unfortunate release dates, poor marketing, and somewhat limited audiences."
"261","Gonna spend the day in Miami, afterwards I'll watch that Guava Island movie. Maybe Missing Link, if I'm lucky. Will probably post photos on Twitter."
"262","guys go and see Missing Link so that Laika doesn't die"
"263","@velvetgh0st I’ve literally just finished watching Missing Link...it was funny and a cute feel good film, 10/10 would recommend x"
"264","Really enjoyed Missing Link, loved that characters, the animation was awesome as is to be expected from Laika at this point, only thing that let it down was the by the numbers story. #MissingLink"
"265","Missing Link was fantastic! Go watch and support it!"
"266","Go see Missing Link in theaters while you can because this may very well be the last Laika film we get in theaters, folks"
"267","Just watched Missing Link in an almost empty cinema. Everyone is missing out on a truly beautiful film... although I do feel I would have been perfectly adequate in the leading role. Maybe the telegram from @LAIKAStudios got waylaid?"
"268","I still want to see Missing Link"
"269","Saw The Missing Link yesterday, what a great film. Go see it"
"270","As unappealing as Missing Link looks, I'm surprised it's bombing as hard as it is

Normally any kids' movie, good or bad, will do well on its first weekend just because it's a kids' movie"
"271","You know, I've seen a lot of people say that Missing Link and its marketing are creepy, especially to kids, and I just don't see it.

I just think that any kids wanting to see a movie this weekend would rather see Shazam."
"272","Forever who went and supported HELLBOY over Missing Link
I’m so disappointed <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"

"276","@GiteshPandya Missing Link really missed"
"277","like in their games it always feels like I'm stuck in the ""boxy cover and other contextual spots"" zone (with some exceptions like areas of the Missing Link) which just feels wrong in an immersive sim

Arkane generally does a good job avoiding that"
"278","@cinemaxwell @OrangeGrove55 Wait, Missing Link is open?!"
"279","@MikeTheKobbler @Revenger210 It's not that I think the numbers matter, it's just that they show a grim tale for Stop Motion Animation.

I agree with you that a Laika movie should see more flocking to theaters and I certainly will try to go watch Missing Link if I find the time, but the reality sadly differs."
"280","Saw Missing Link yesterday. It was funny, entertaining &amp; the stop motion animation was absolutely incredible. @LAIKAStudios does it again.

This has been another episode of Mark Reviews Films."
"281","Just watched The Missing Link, such a fun family film!"
"282","How does something like Wonder Park have 3x the opening of Missing Link? 

Second, how does Laika stay a float? Nothing has been wildly successful box office wise, do they sell a ton of dvds? Successful commercial arm? No clue. Happy for it. But just clueless how they operate."
"283","If you have time, please go watch Laika's Missing Link! I got to work with some really nice and talented people, and the charm shows. Stop motion movies are magic and indeed need our support."
"284","I really wanna see Shazam with my mom but my brother wants to see Missing Link. Which one?!?!"
"285","Search for the Missing Link at the Patent Office."
"286","Every frame of Missing Link is completely stunning. If any animated film should recieve recognition by the Academy Awards for its production design, cinematography and costumes, it's this one."
"287","Missing Link is adorable <U+0001F496>"
"288","@jlawwarrior @SMendes_goalz @poppoIIs @aftermovie Considering the amount of theaters After was shown in, in the US, it isn’t horrible. Missing Link premiered the same day in the US, and in 1000 more theaters, yet it made 1 million less. So no it isn’t bad. Also After is number one in a lot of other countries."
"289","Off to see ""Missing Link"" by @LAIKAStudios with Mrs SFB.  #bigfoot"
"290","Buying my 'Missing Link' tix for tomorrow, and theater's pretty packed. Maybe April vacation might bring a little bit of legs. Oh well, it'll likely live on."
"291","Despite that...due to lousy marketing, stop motion animated films get very little attention and revenue. Missing Link is a neat little adventure that deserves to be known about."
"292","Just saw Missing Link. One of Laika's best looking films. The sets are beautifully crafted and diverse and there's plenty of humor, heart and swashbuckling action to appreciate. I wish the story and characters were a tad stronger, though."
"293","Anyone see Missing Link? I've not been disappointed by Laika but this just doesn't look good to me."
"294","So... Missing Link is utterly delightful and @LAIKAStudios is full of mad geniuses"

"296","Missing Link is super fun and entertaining and @LAIKAStudios should be so proud of how funny they’ve been able to make a bunch of models."
"297","@RealLeitungVG I’m not surprised it’s bombing.
With Kubo, you could tell there was a lot of people talking about how DUDE YOU GOT TO WATCH THIS and it only made its budget back.
Right before Missing Link came out I didn’t hear jackshit."
"298","Taking a break from the books... @cineworld. Film 40. Missing Link #CineworldUnlimited #100filmsin2019"
"299","@JaydenSapp2 @Animated_Antic It's entirely possible it was one of the first trailers shown, in which case I would've missed it, but I didn't see that in my showing of Missing Link."
"300","Legit question: do you think it's right for people to say that Missing Link bombing negates the right for people to complain about lack of originality in animation?

I'm conflicted on this mentality myself. From what I can tell it was utter lack of marketing."
"301","@chillinboyika @DirtySewerGunk And when something like Missing Link IS marketed, they aren't quite able to do the film justice. I can at least understand in this case, because it really is the execution that held the film together, but still, Laika should not get the short end of the stick in that aspect."
"302","@Animated_Antic I can at least see Missing Link being kind of a tough film to do justice, since its main charms are in its execution, but I just don't get why Laika always gets the short end of the stick nowadays in terms of that aspect. And yet Illumination continues to make bang..."
"303","@RJRobotham @Animated_Antic Thank goodness Spider-verse was at least successful.

But seriously, I remember Kubo being decently marketed, or at least I saw a fair number of ads for it compared to Missing Link. So why did that only barely break even?"
"304","Despite aiming for the mainstream, Laika's Missing Link has staggered to just $5.8M: their lowest opening weekend to date.

While their creatively-driven strategy is admirable, how much longer can they afford to dedicate effort and time to projects that just aren't making money?"
"305","The animated 'Missing Link' debuts at #9 with a paltry $5.8M in the U.S.  It's a shame but hopefully Laika Studios can learn from this and make a profitable film.  The stunning craft that goes into their films is extraordinary."
"306","You, an intellectual: L’Enfant Sauvage

"307","@cartoonbrew Missing Link would've worked better if it got a release on September or a more quiet month for the box office. Just any date that doesn't go against superhero movies.

And to advertise correctly it should be more than a few trailers and TV spots. Try harder with social media."
"308","@ERCboxoffice So Missing Link has become... the Weakest Link?"
"309","We beat the crowds (9 a.m.<U+0001F923>)! And loved our 33rd Wedding Anniversary morning with our own “private showing” of Missing Link!! —something made with help of someone WE made 30 years ago<U+0001F601>. Proud of Chloe being involved in such a beautiful (and fun!) movie with LAIKA"
"310","@BBC6Music Last few suggestions from me - I Can Add by They Might Be Giants, Mathematics by George Clinton and Parliament and the wonderful Pinball Number Count by Fred Leslie's Missing Link. #np6music"
"311","This is just so sad, especially as Kubo and now Missing Link have really broken out of the American stop-motion mold where every film is horror-oriented, and branched out into other visual/tonal paradigms. It has so many possibilities as a form. And no one seems to care."
"312","@Elevation_Pics You know, call me crazy but when I watch a feature like Missing Link I want the voices to mesh *with* the characters rather than distract from them.  Which if I have to pay attention to which big name star voices the characters completely wrecks that."
"313","I saw Missing Link today and it was another lovely entry into the Laika canon. Their stop-motion animation is always so intricate and hurts my brain thinking about how much work goes into making those puppets believably alive."
"314","But for this weekend, yeah two or three whammies in one: stop-motion generally disregarded once again at the box office, more bad news for Annapurna already struggling independently, and Missing Link opening before tons of movies destined to overshadow it."
"315","It's too early to say how Missing Link impact Laika in anyway, but if Laika has enough Hollywood support to gain independent financing for their movies then it's very easy to guess one of them could be a streaming exclusive somewhere."
"316","@CornMonger Yeah, it does. Have you guys seen Missing Link? We watched it during our terror exile. There's a really good part where the Yeti don't want the Sasquatch to live among them so they throw him in a pit, When he &amp; the explorer escape, Emma Thompson's character screams:"
"317","Shame that Missing Link isn’t doing well because the ending leaves it perfect for further installments."
"318","I got done watching Missing Link and the Critics were not wrong about this film being great.

It was adventurous, charming, hilarious, cute, and has a lot of important life lessons. 

I also need to praise Laika for providing great animation and they continue making great movies."
"319","It is very obvious that Missing Link was supposed to be the mainstream moneymaker and since it just kinda failed at that...fuck"
"320","Missing Link is definitely the most I've enjoyed a Laila movie starts since ParaNorman, it gets my recommendation"
"321","@FredCStresing Have you seen Missing Link yet? About 30 minutes in I started pretending it was secretly about Guybrush and Elaine  and I've never been happier"
"322","It's tricky to talk about the low Missing Link BO bc I didn't like the movie but it didnt look all that kid friendly and the character designs werent very cute. Also many are more acclimated to cgi than other forms of animation these days"
"323","People talking about why The Missing Link bombed at the box office and honestly it's because it doesn't matter how good the animation is if the marketing is god-awful"
"324","Thinking about this film a bit and reflecting upon others I've seen, I've placed Missing Link as my third favorite film of the year, while bumping Lego Movie 2 down to fourth place. I think Missing Link had the stronger narrative, characters, and humor.

Alita remains 2nd~"
"325","About to see Missing Link in theater!!!!"
"326","I feel so bad for Missing Link. I love Laika films but this one? IDK the sheer style of it all just makes me not want to see it? The character design bugs me and I just don't like how it looks??"
"327","Went to see Missing Link today, Laika has knocked it out of the park again! Loved the designs, the cinematography, the action sequences - the double act comedy scenes between Lionel Frost and Link made me laugh very hard"
"328","I have seen Missing Link twice now. It is fun. Please give Laika your money. They make beautiful art. @LAIKAStudios #MissingLink"
"329","Just saw ""Missing Link"" today and it was incredible. The story, the characters and the animation are amazing and it's really fun to watch. If it's up your alley, then this movie is for you. ;)
Final score: 8.5/10."
"330","@TurboBurpo damn gotta watch Missing Link then. whole-heartedly agree with the rest"
"331","Missing Link good! Doesn't ever reach the heights of Kubo or Paranorman, but still a gorgeous stop motion adventure worth seeing on a big screen if you can!

(Especially as we need to support original creative animated films no shade but I saw the angry birds 2 trailer and cried)"
"332","@boogans Yep it’s called Missing Link &amp; it apparently is already out &amp; I’ve seen one ad on twitter for it and nothing else"

"334","Hello hello hello. Videos that should come up this week; 
Age of Ultron Drunk Review, Laika's Missing Link review, and review of Avengers: Infinity War review in light of Endgame coming up."
"335","Please go see Missing Link. The trailers don’t do justice to this beautiful, funny Laurel and Hardy epic! Support original film especially animation!"
"336","@bullyray5150 @THETOMMYDREAMER Tiger Chung Lee !  he should have tagged with Alexis Smirnoff and The Missing Link to fit the Pre Hogan WWF in the 80s picture."
"337","less than $6mil opening take for LAIKA Studio's latest flick.  And I get it.  Missing Link looked super-uninteresting in trailers.  It got good critical praise, but you gotta sell the goods to the people through fun trailers, which Missing Link did not have"

"344","@1TheStickman1 Also, it'd be a lot easier to go see Missing Link if it weren't currently the pre-Passover rush, which is then followed by the Jewish version of Lent for the next month..."
"345","""Missing Link"" is going to be fine. It's owned by Nike's co-founder and run by his son. They have plenty of money to recoup their budget. Disney isn't much inclined to pay heed to their art style. They've already ignored Spider-Verse &amp; The LEGO films."
"346","There's something to be written about how Zoe Saldana in ""Missing Link"" is directed to lean into her Latina side, but not her Black side. Usually it's the other way around for Hollywood and Afro-Latinxs, but it still indicates US film hasn't really broadened its perspective."
"347","The Missing Link is a solid children's animated adventure romp, propped up by its meticulous craft &amp; stunning visual design. It's not Laika's most meaningful instalment and Galifianakis is surprisingly underwhelming as the titular Sasquatch but it looks incredible &amp; has good fun."
"348","@vaughnpinpin The Missing Link one remind me too much of the 40 year old virgin poster"

I went to see Missing Link today with my mother and we were the only ones there? Which makes me sad cause it's a really nice movie, and looking online it doesn't seem to be doing well. Laika has such nice stories and animation, they deserve better"
"355","Go fucking watch Missing Link, Laika’s work in incredible and they deserve to do well for their amazing craftsmanship on this movie’s. It’s a good movie, watch it you really mean it when you say you like original animated movies and *want more*"
"356","I must go see Missing Link soon, the visuals looks stunning"
"357","About to watch the probably shit Missing Link movie but I’m sure I’ll like it ;)"
"358","@jnicolemorgan I spent today with my bestie and nephew, just saw Missing Link. Feeling guilty for skipping home church and not telling them (but also less anxiety not being there, and anxiety at texting them) + same for skipping service at new ECLA Lutheran Church I've been to...twice?"
"359","@triniitea Let’s just take a minute to appreciate Laika for a sec anyway cause Kubo, Coraline, Paranorman, and other stuff I can’t remember/ haven’t seen in a while. 
True animation pioneers and instant classics the minute they come out! (Haven’t seen Missing Link yet, I will though!)"
"360","Missing Link is a cute and pure movie we love cryptids in this house"
"361","yall if you get the chance, watch ‘Missing Link'

no it is not a movie about missing sausages"
"362","I’m seeing Missing Link ASAP! I mean I already planned on seeing it ASAP, but with worries about it’s performance, I gotta support it quick! Last time I didn’t go see a stop-mo animated film right after it came out (Early Man) it was out of theaters before I even could see it!"
"363","Love Laika but Missing Link gave me Box Troll vibes where it'd be alright but nothing spectacular, nice to see it doing well critically though and they deserve more recognition than they get, guess it's what happens when stop motion takes a few years in between each release :/"
"364","@HarryThomasPic Best: KUBO and the Two Strings
Worst: The Boxtrolls

Awwww I loved Missing Link Harry lol"
"365","Missing Link is one of the rare cases where on the outside, the movie looks like it has a ""farnting and pooping be like peeeop poo foopffffff blofrp poomp"" joke, but when you get into it, it's surprisingly good"
"366","@HarryThomasPic I've yet to see Missing Link, but I agree with you on Coraline."
"367","Got back from seeing Missing Link. Absolutely stunning stop-motion visuals from Laika, I was really impressed with the sheer variety of settings they brought to life in the movie. Very enjoyable."
"368","Missing Link was so fun! I appreciate their awareness of current social climate and subversion of tropes."
"369","@HarryThomasPic I haven't seen Missing Link but Coraline is one of my favorite movies of all time!"
"370","Laika really doesn't deserve the flop their movies get :/ I haven't seen Missing Link yet but u bet I will their films are gorgeous"
"371","I have seen 15 Missing Link ads in 20 minutes of this Portland / OKC game and I now hate this movie viscerally"
"372","The ""Missing Link"" stop motion movie is such a good film imo. Serious but funny &amp; i'm happy that both the main british guy and the spanish woman tried to troll each other throughout the film in a playful platonic way."
"373","My wife is waaay better than me at organising fun activities for our daughter. But the fact she's just offered a nine-year-old the choice of seeing Dumbo, Missing Link or Pet Sematary for a cinema trip proves that I've got her beaten on film knowledge at least. #EveryoneLovesPets"
"374","People comparing Missing Link to Paranorman and Boxtrolls is getting me pumped because those are far and away my favourite Laika movies."
"375","Cartoon twitter: Give us an animated movie that isn't CGI.

*Missing Link comes out*

Cartoon twitter: Zzzzzzzzzzz...."
"376","@RottenEggReview its real sad that Missing Link isn't performing well 

but

thats what happens when Laika decides to focus on the fact they stick out with stopmotion 

its in the same vain of people saying "" high def games are better!!""

yes look visually 'better', but its lacking content"
"377","PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! if you can please go watch Missing Link in the cinemas!!! its got lots of love put into it like every laika movie please!!! its not doing so well rn!"
"378","This is what Missing Link should've done, streaming is making hand over fist in cash, if it was on there they'd make their money back handily."
"379","@BeachEpisode I thought Boxtrolls was the weakest Laika film despite being really enjoyable, which just demonstrates how rad Laika films are

But if Missing Link is really on Paranorman's level I'm gonna die"
"380","Hey animation folks

Since advertising has been little to none, Laika's 'Missing Link' IS OUT. It opened on the 12th and it really seems like no one noticed.

Heck I was looking forward to it and I thought we had another couple weeks!"
"381","@mayhem_crimson I don’t necessarily blame Laika for Missing Link’s failure, I blame Annapurna Pictures.
They didn’t even market that movie at all, they only showed one trailer and that’s it.
The only profitable movie from Annapurna Pictures is “Vice” and that movie only made $13 Million profit."
"382","Audience: Man, animated movies are so cookie cutter nowadays, nothing original comes out anymore.

*Missing Link comes out*

Audience: Hmmmmmm... I think I'll got see Shazam again instead."
"383","Missing Link- The comedy wasn’t particularly strong. The animation however is wonderful. A good adventure for families."
"384","Missing Link is more mature than I was expecting (like all of Laika's films). Not just because it has people shooting guns at each other—it puts a cool twist on the whole pulp-action adventurer story, it's really tightly edited, and Zach Galifianakis works better than he should."
"385","Still, a Laika film is a unique pleasure, and the smoothness of their animation keeps getting better. Missing Link doesn't achieve the pure visual poetry of Kubo and the Two Strings, but it's nevertheless immensely satisfying just to watch these characters move through the world."
"386","@ceruleetheblue I'm not part of any fandom? And if people hate me for telling the truth then so be it <U+0001F605> I didn't insult anyone and my tweet is not directed to people who are not interested in seeing Missing Link"
"387","@ceruleetheblue I don't know 'cause it doesn't work that way in my country <U+0001F602> usually here films that come out in summer are delayed to fall or even winter. That's the case with Missing Link too, but I doubt it will help"
"388","@ceruleetheblue Don't care about Missing Link? That's absolutely fine. But you lose your right to complain about remakes and stuff if that's all you watch in cinemas, and you constantly neglect original movies. That's what I'm saying."
"389","I saw many people complaining that Missing Link is coming out in October in their countries... well once again apparently I'm the winner 'cause it's coming out in NOVEMBER in Italy <U+0001F605>"
"390","@benthelooney You know when you walk in the theater and there's a neon sign that says what movie you're going to watch above the theater door? There wasn't one for Missing Link."
"391","Missing Link BO was tiny but not as tiny as these grosses for 2019 anim releases. The US has 325 million people &amp; less than 500 of them see some of these films.
Ruben Brandt Collector (Sony Classic): $110,562
This Magnificent Cake (GKIDS): $5,919
Tito &amp; the Birds (Shout): $4,332"
"392","Some catching up since I always forget to Tweet before I watch:

4/12: Hellboy (2019), Missing Link&amp; The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot."
"393","@YesitsAlistair The Missing Link is a fun adventure film, the kind we rarely get anymore and it has heart and soul for days

We rarely see anything as energetic and unique as this in modern animated films and we shouldn't ignore it"
"394","Hahaha omg
I think Missing Link has taken a spot above ParaNorman for me, oh my god

What a brilliant and extremely modern, age relevant message/moral as well. I hate to be ""so brave..."" but it's nice to see something not give a shit about conservative views"
"395","depressing how the Missing Link went for a lighter tone and more baby humor just to be more marketable and it still bombs. Good interesting original animated films are dooooomed."
"396","@kirkneverdied The problem with Laika for me is that unless you've seen their previous work, the trailers don't look promising and they out themselves in a busy month. I've not seen any of the other films and I heard they were better than Missing Link unfortunately."
"397","@kirkneverdied I go see all the Animated Movies and I saw this one highly recommend it but they have a poor marketing I didn't get a Missing Link trailer in a Theater once"
"398","@MTCN_Reviews I actually saw Missing Link the other day so I'd be Interested to hear your thoughts"
"399","I'm seeing stuff since Missing Link is out and I wanna make it clear: 

Just because people are annoyed by bland remakes of movies doesn't mean they are obliged to love every other original movie out there"
"400","@foxy_scientist That literally has nothing to do with the Missing Link."
"401","Hey parents with children on spring break, go see Missing Link. It's got something for everyone and it's gorgeously animated adventure."
"402","#MissingLink was very good. There's been like 10 sasquatch/yeti movies in the past year and a new DreamWorks one coming out soon for some reason. Missing Link is the only one you should see <U+0001F44C>"
"403","Allll of this being said
I wanna see Missing Link. The ads had really genuine voice acting. It looks like a fun and beautiful adventure movie and I will let y’all know my thoughts

If that sounds like you go watch it
If not, we’ll don’t! Obviously
Maybe watch the DVD later"
"404","Saying you want them isn't enough, you actually have to go and support these films if you want to see them. Yes, Annapurna is partially to blame for Missing Link's failure, by giving it the bare minimum of marketing. (2/4)"
"405","While I don't think it's one of Laika's better films, I am a little sad to see Missing Link doing so horribly.

Maybe in the future it will have string DVD sales."
"406","While it's very sad that Missing Link under-performed, I don't think it exclusively stands as the ""original movie"" top example. There's been original movies that have bombed, and ones that succeeded. And I think people can NOT like reboots without seeing this movie."
"407","@zZToastie I think homie just really liked Missing Link <U+0001F62D>"
"408","I used to be one of these people but can we stop blaming and harassing anyone else for not liking reboots or these live action remakes for the cause of Missing Link's box office performance. This has gone way too far."
"409","@nautiscarader @GalacticGoober You call Avengers Endgame “The Endgame”. Of course you think Missing Link is bad"
"410","@StormTheArtist As someone who did see Missing Link in theaters, it is incredibly frustrating to see so many people complain that they want more original movies yet they don't go see them. They're honestly putting their money where their mouth is."
"411","@GreenRangerDon @RebelliousEwok Duh, more promotion on their stuff. Missing Link Barely had anything. I knew the movie was coming but didn't know it would come this April. I do feel the movie fitted well for a September release"
"412","Missing Link debuted with $5.94M this weekend.

#MissingLink  #BoxOffice  @AnnapurnaPics  @LAIKAStudios"
"413","Laika have proven once again that they should be held to the same calibre as Pixar. Missing Link is one of the best family films in years. These guys are wizards."
"414","Unfortunate that Missing Link underperformed this weekend but I heard nothing about it through promotions that would make me want to see it plus the Sasquatch is just frightening I’m sorry"
"415","@RORadio @jj_mason Agreed. I was actually really excited that Missing Link was looking like a more mainstream animated comedy and was hoping that help them get more success."
"416","Very sad that Missing Link is not making the money it deserves. A review will be soon but it is again a very good Laika feature."
"417","@mugiwara_noah Yeah, I love Kubo and ParaNorman, but nothing about Missing Link was compelling me to see it in theaters other than Laika. Especially when Endgame, Code Geass, and Detective Pikachu are all coming our back to back in a few weeks."
"418","@kirkneverdied That Missing Link opened so low. Even though I’m not the target audience for it, the trailer and TV spots looked fine."
"419","@TheAlphaJayShow Seeing the behind the scenes work put into stop-motion animated movies really makes me appreciate the hard work that goes into them. It’s another big reason to why seeing Missing Link not do so well makes me feel even more sad. Just rubs salt in the wound."
"420","I’m not surprised that Missing Link is flopping.

1. Laika just seems to have has miserable luck at the box-office, no matter how good their films are.
2. Annapurna sucks dick at marketing their movies."
"421","Man this Missing Link business reeeeaallly sucks. On one hand the advertising was nill, and on another, it's coming on the heels of another Bigfoot movie and there's not that much of a Bigfoot market...

I really want to support it but I also have like... -5 interest in bigfoot."
"422","@kirkneverdied I don’t think it’s too surprising. Knew Hellboy would flop. I’m also not shocked with Missing Link. I think a big issue is the marketing, but I also don’t think there’s a huge demand for stop-motion."
"423","What's sad is that Missing Link and other Laika film's box office failures will be blamed on audiences not liking stop-motion, but the average movie-goers likely have no idea these movies are even stop-motion"
"424","@bpd3m0n @ComicsintheGA @GirlyWolfPup @HYeahTeenSupers Missing Link does not have a pre-existing narrative."
"425","@ComicsintheGA @bpd3m0n @GirlyWolfPup @HYeahTeenSupers I can agree with you on Kid Who Would Be King, but if you watch Missing Link, you'll see that the only thing about it that's taken from anything else is that one of the main characters is a Bigfoot. That's it. The movie tells a completely original story with original characters."
"426","I see a lot of people claiming they didn't see Missing Link cuz of bad marketing. I'm not gonna hear that excuse from y'all because if you spent less time screaming about Disney Remakes and more time spreading around original animated films, it might have had better turnout."
"427","People bitching about Missing Link having a bad box office opening, but have they considered that, based on the trailer I saw, the movie looks shitty??? Like, every other movie from that studio looked visually impressive and appealing, but this looked like a dumpster fire to me."
"428","@javi_draws @cyou_wa They have some publicity at Menchie's Frozen yogurt via a mango flavor and themed paper cups, and AMC theaters has a Missing Link Mango icee. Those are the only two things I know of."
"429","@alexdavidwoods @RebelliousEwok Smallfoot, Abominable, Missing Link, and Son of Sasquatch"
"430","whoops i didnt see The fuckin Missing Link i guess i lost my license to not see live action remakes and reboots"
"431","Missing Link does a lot of shit like this that the main game never really fucked around with

this, more involved convos outside social boss fights, patrols being changed up depending on how you played the prior area, etc"
"432","Now Laika definitely does have a marketing problem and Missing Link was definitely underpromoted and probably would've done better in the fall. I really hope they find a distributor who will truly market their films, but the moviegoing audience also needs to do better as well."
"433","Now Laika definitely does have a marketing problem and Missing Link was definitely underpromoted. I really hope they find a distributor who will truly market their films, but the moviegoing audience also needs to do better as well."
"434","@FilmCaCinemas I also haven't seen Missing Link. I liked that studio's last effort 'Kubo and the 2 Strings' and I enjoy stop motion animation. I'll try to get to it before it is gone."
"435","Missing Link is such a cute and funny movie, please go see it."
"436","When trailers shown mere weeks before release (in theaters, at least) don't have a release date, I can't exactly plan ahead to support a movie.

It's a shame, too, because the middling-at-best trailers for Missing Link apparently don't do the film justice."
"437","@BadMoodMorgado I saw Shazam Saturday. I also saw High Life on Sunday which is sitting at $300,000. Maybe I should yell at this guy for going to see comparative mega-hit Missing Link instead of that."
"438","Anyway, if you haven't seen Missing Link already, I definitely recommend checking it out. Its a fun, well-animated action-adventure comedy film and another solid piece of work by Laika."
"439","I'm now determined to go see The Missing Link in theaters when I have a chance. I want to support it and I think it looks charming and funny."
"440","lrt we actually took my niece to see Missing Link and it was actually a pretty cute movie!"
"441","People: We are tired of sequels and reboots, give us something original!

@LAIKAStudios makes #MissingLink, their funniest and prettiest film to date.

People: Eh, let's go watch Dumbo.

Missing Link deserved WAY more than it earned this weekend. You need to see this movie. NEED."
"442","Fighting a stomach ache just to see ‘Missing Link’, maybe the only day I can see it. No cookies, don’t need any."
"443","@Yokomation @justindoublem It is a bright spot, for sure. I just wish Lego Movie 2 did better, and that Missing Link didn't flop."
"444","I would say this is far more on bad marketing than the audience not helping. I am an animator and I first heard of Missing Link like last week, no wonder people who are not in the industry don’t hear about original films  <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"445","I'm a Laika fan, but I'm glad that the public is not rewarding Missing Link. That shit reeks like Wes Anderson."
"446","I'm a Laika fan, but I'm glad that the public is not rewarding Missing Link. That shit reeks Wes Anderson's condescending whiteness."
"447","@DenimSinatra Ha thank I, I wish it was true lol... Master Z is directed by one of the greats martial arts directors/choreographers, he n the cast put a great show. I went to see The Missing Link on Saturday, lovely work of old fashined animation and storytelling"
"448","@GoldenLink64 @RebelliousEwok But that has to do with how the movie is marketed. If the trailer's not appealing in the first place [to those on the fence], then it won't do as well overall. Saw the movie yesterday, and Missing Link holds its story well, and to me, makes the characters &amp; situations believable."
"449","I enjoyed Missing Link but it's a strange one. The dialogue and much of the film felt like it was aimed at adults but it has been pitched at children. Who, in general,  I think may be bored. It also felt too short in terms of character development."
"450","New times for DUMBO 
12:55 3:45 6:35 9:25 

Also tomorrow is the LAST DAY for Missing Link!"
"451","@GirlyWolfPup It's called terrible marketing. There was nothing that made these films stand out. The Missing Link film had terrible/minimal marketing and that other film I haven't even heard of. Calling your film Missing Link will also make it almost impossible to find highlighted on google..."
"452","The Missing Link...."
"453","By the way, I DO think it's a little unfair to pin Missing Link's box-office failure entirely on moviegoers. Especially since stop-motion animation has never been all that popular with general audiences..."
"454","I think i might share my thoughts on Missing Link's box office numbers in a blog entry. I have thoughts..."
"455","Anyway, unless I can pull off a miracle, no movies in theatres for me until late-May. Sorry, Missing Link..."
"456","@GirlyWolfPup @ianmcque LAiKA studios are amazing  their style is awesome. ...and Missing Link is a funny film."
"457","@ScottMendelson @Forbes I want to see Missing Link a lot. Unfortunately, I got talked into Hellboy instead. Regrets were made."
"458","I plan on watching Missing Link as well, as I love claymation film and this one looks cute. But seriously, go support and tweet and post about movies that aren't doing so well at the box office so people support creativity. So that people support art."
"459","Hi please go watch Missing Link in cinemas to support Laika Studios!!!! They're a stop-motion production company who's produced films such as Kubo and the Two-Strings, Corpse Bride, and Coraline!"
"460","Wasn’t Missing Link made by the same studio that made Coraline??? Yo go watch it in cinemas shksbs"
"461","Do y’all want to know the sad truth? If Missing Link was made by Disney, more people would be seeing it."
"462","i only found out less than a week ago that Missing Link was coming out so soon and like, i keep up with animation!! thats how bad the marketing was!!"
"463","companies don't want to invest in decent marketing when they're unconfident in a film that isn't a part of a franchise. you can't blame the audiences for that. i genuinely had no clue Missing Link was releasing so soon cuz of its poor marketing."
"464","The Missing Link is excellent. Really funny. My favourite kids film of the year so far. Laika continue to make really ambitious, distinctive and entertaining films."
"465","Missing Link BO was tiny but not as tiny as these grosses for 2019 anim releases. The US has 325 million people &amp; less than 500 of them see some of these films. Ruben Brandt Collector (Sony Classic): $110,562 This Magnificent Cake (GKIDS): $5,919 Tito &amp; the Birds (Shout): $4,332"
"466","I feel guilty not seeing Missing Link. I’ve been really busy lately and pretty low on cash, but I’ll try and see it at least this weekend or next week before I head to Disneyland"
"467","@rajandelman the article they used as evidence implies that all the other laika movies were successful. If more people went to see Box Trolls than Missing Link they really fucked up."
"468","@dontdierobb Missing Link, that one is a must-see right now if you enjoy animation or just good movies in general"
"469","@benthelooney Even from the trailers, Missing Link looks really bland and generic. Some of Laika's earlier stuff was fantastic, like Kubo and Paranorman. Every studio has a misstep."
"470","While I wasn't entirely sold on the story for The Missing Link, it's still a simple and fun adventure film, and of course the eye popping animation and colour palettes manages to carry it through. So I recommend checking it out."
"471","@KoritoPrime I’ve literally never heard of Missing Link before people complaining it bombed."
"472","@AlecPhan Haven't seen it yet, but Missing Link looks cute, though my theater barely sold any tickets for it on its opening weekend. Everybody has been partial to Shazam! so that may be your best bet if you just want something reliably good."
"473","To my disappointment Missing Link won't even air in my local movie theaters.
This is bullshit. How can people outside of the US can actually see a movie if it won't even air?!"
"474","Okay, so I think I’m going to start releasing a weekly schedule for films we’re planning to see so you guys can tell me directly what you care about and what you don’t.  With that said, this week’s films will be:
Hellboy

Missing Link

Little (time permitting)"
"475","@GirlyWolfPup Never even heard of Missing Link until I saw all these articles about how it's not doing well against #1 box office movie, Shazam. Shocking. Shazam isn't a reboot or remake. Granted it's based off the comic, but given DC's track record, this is still a happy surprise. Next,"
"476","@pigeonFOO I blame localized algorithms. I never saw a single Missing Link advertisement. Didn't even know it was coming out. Saw lots of Little Foot sponsored ads before that released. I'm bombarded daily with Endgame, Shazam, Hellboy, and John Wick 3 posters and trailers on FB and YTube."
"477","@LovelyAndyUK @SidPhoenix2211 @GirlyWolfPup Oh, 100% this. Doesn't help that Missing Link had almost no advertising whatsoever."
"478","Took the kids to see Missing Link and can’t say enough great things about it. @LAIKAStudios has surpassed all other animation houses on this one. Every shot is perfect. The script is tight w perfect foundation while being wholly unique. The animation is top to bottom exquisite."
"479","@LibHawker Have you watched 'Missing Link'?? I saw it over the weekend &amp; it was wonderful. I think you of all people would appreciate the message :)"
"480","SPOILER: This whole time, the Missing Link...was love."
"481","SUPPORT ORIGINAL CONTENT!!! Go see The Missing Link! Stop-motion animation NEEDS this win!"
"482","@KamenSpider I saw the Kid trailer a few times but never saw anything for Missing Link even while seeing several films in theaters where the trailer would have fit in fine"
"483","@GirlyWolfPup I had no idea Missing Link was out already. There was 0 advertisement for it :U"
"484","I completely understand this but I personally wasn't very interested in these films based on the trailers :/

Ok I'm interested in seeing Missing Link but only because it's a LAIKA film, the actual plot looks kinda meh imo (watch me end up loving it now lmao)"
"485","Missing Link was great, Laika’s craftsmanship continues to be absolutely top notch. It’s a wonder to behold, and I hope more people go out and see it. Highly recommended!"
"486","Listen, I don't want to argue with anyone, but I'm seeing a lot of people talking about not even hearing about the Missing Link movie until now. I've seen constant ads through YouTube and Twitter for several weeks so I don't really understand why nobody else knew about it. <U+0001F615>"
"487","@Smafa That's a really good idea, oh my gosh.

We're planning on breakfast at F&amp;B and then seeing Missing Link, but hanging out in a nice cafe in town after sounds heavenly!~"
"488","@chuckwoolery @gatewaypundit And Green appears to be a Missing Link."
"489","Okay I saw Missing Link and I really liked it but here's my Laika ranking:

1. ParaNorman
2. Kubo and the Two Strings
3. Coraline
4. The Boxtrolls
5. Missing Link

While I did very much enjoy Missing Link, it didn't appeal to me as well as their previous films. But that's just me"
"490","‘Missing Link’ is a very texturally satisfying film."
"491","Missing Link could have been better recieved with better advertising. The last ad I saw for it was one time, which feels like a year ago. This ties into artistic web presence: No one knows you have fantastic work if you don’t create a platform to show it."
"492","Bit sad Missing Link (Original voices) wil not only play a city away from me. But the only showing is at a really bad time. =_=‘"
"493","@Animated_Antic I went to see Missing Link on Saturday, and not too many people showed up. I have to agree with you."
"494","V. keen to go see Missing Link but of course all the showings are in the middle of the day <U+0001F62B>"
"495","@KamenSpider Can't speak for Kid Who Would be King (saw a few trailers for it) but advertising for Missing Link has been all up ins! Trailers everywhere, and ads and promotions on several SocMed sites I frequent, including a bunch right here on Twitter."
"496","These takes legit make me feel like I've been living in an alternate universe. Like where were y'all, ads for Missing Link have been *inescapable* to me since Spider-Verse."
"497","@Mrgiggleshouseo *heavy sigh* 
Missing Link is in theaters right now. Us is still in theaters.  I am seeing several other movies that while I do not, myself, plan to watch are not remakes or reboots of previous properties. 

Ma comes out pretty soon."
"498","People with their shitty ""bad marketing is the reason"" Takes...... I saw SO MUCH marketing for Missing Link. Where were YOU looking? I saw ads and posters every week. 

Also ""KiDs mOviEs"" reeks of stupidity. Ever seen a Laika film? Shut up."
"499","@kevin_video Half of our YouTube ads before videos were trailers for Missing Link so I doubt that somehow millions of people were not aware of the movie but instead chose to ignore it and the  are SHOCKED it didn't do well in the box office because THEY ALL IGNORED IT *sigh*"
"500","The animators at @LAIKAStudios are some of the best actors I’ve ever seen. Missing Link is a fantastic movie, please go see it soon!!!!"
"501","Studios are also partly to blame because they don't push their original movies enough. Even though I love Laika, I had no interest in Missing Link because the trailers were mid as hell and I barely saw them in pre-shows at the theaters"

It's perfect for Zionists"
"503","Missing Link was an absolutely incredible work of art"
"504","@scousepie Me and The Kid enjoyed Missing Link, though."
"505","One other mother has joined us now. Do you think they dropped their kids off in Missing Link?"
"506","@NineJackals Laika movies almost always (I liked Kubo a lot despite this) have a vague, kinda whimsical, ""we'd like to be Roald Dahl but don't have his writers"" quality and that Missing Link movie looks like the exact same shit. This movie looks like Boxtrolls with Bigfoot."
"507","How did the release date for Missing Link slip past me, its been out for 3 days and I didn’t even notice. I’m begging someone to see Missing Link with me pls. :’v"
"508","I legitimately had no idea Missing Link even existed. The first time I heard of the film at all was yesterday when I saw the article about it bombing in the U.S."
"509","@GemCityGem I didn’t realize Missing Link was them until recently, which is a good example of how far their brand has fallen"
"510","Anyone who came to the #animation sessions, make sure you go see Missing Link at the cinema! Very hard to believe, but that’s the same stop motion we were doing...!"
"511","@GirlyWolfPup You clearly didn’t take into account how badly marketed Missing Link was. Laika’s marketing team has been known to have really bad marketing to the point that the audience doesn’t even know the film exists so no the audience isn’t to blame for this. This is a pretty bad take tbh"
"512","@GirlyWolfPup The thing you failed to consider here is how badly marketed Missing Link was. The marketing for Laika has been known to have really shitty to the point that the audience doesn’t even know the film exists so no the audience isn’t to blame for this. This is a pretty bad take tbh"

"514","update:

Animation History...

We might also lose stop motion animated films if Laika goes under, as it's recent Missing Link was a Box Office disaster.

I am afraid what would happen if Laika's next film bombs..."
"515","@MikeIsAHuman @madjackrabbit I don't know about that. Annapurna (the US distributor of Missing Link) is run by a billionaire's offspring too, yet there's reports of the billionaire taking more control after the offspring spent too freely"
"516","@feyrah Saw a few ads for Missing Link but it was literally a day or two before the release date, which is of course not good marketing. 

The other I only heard mentioned on a podcast once."
"517","@javi_draws The only advertising I saw was posters in the actual theater and AMC doing a promotion of their limited ""Missing Link"" Mango Icee flavor. I might've seen a small trailer in the beginning of a movie months ago but I'm not sure :/"
"518","@GirlyWolfPup No lie I only even just heard about Missing Link 3 days ago :(
Unfortunately I live in small town and it likely won't come here for another month or so
shame too because it legit looks like a fun movie!!"
"519","Real shame about 'Missing Link' struggling.. It's gorgeous, charming, and incredibly well made. I think the marketing of the 'creature' instead of the 'adventure' aspect of the film led to it's demise. The orange 'character' poster was, quite frankly, ugly."
"520","the new LAIKA movie Missing Link came out recently and looks gorgeous so i think i’ll see that instead of HB"
"521","This week! Missing Link is a really funny movie you should all go see!

Plus, sequels for Shazam and Tomb Raider take positive steps forward and shoes are actually holding up Space Jam 2?

All this and more, check us out!"
"522","@Solaxee @GirlyWolfPup @ianmcque I was made well aware Missing Link existed, but never heard of The Kid Who Would Be King until seeing this post"
"523","@LAIKAStudios Tomorrow night we plan to see Missing Link in our local theater.  Looking forward to the show!"
"524","@pissoffghosts I think the advertisement had a lot to do with the audience type! I knew about Missing Link because I follow animated movies because I love them, but I had people reply to me telling me they had no idea either existed."
"525","@KrsJams He’s definitely into it on more than just a superficial level, “Missing Link” has a reference to kitty Pryde AND molecule man lmao"
"526","I’ve seen a ton of “Why didn’t people go see ‘Missing Link’, this is why we only get reboots &amp; sequels” but also this is the first time I’ve heard about that movie?"
"527","I used to be one of these people but can we stop taking blaming or harassing anyone else for not liking reboots and live action remakes for the cause of Missing Link's box office performance. This has gone way too far."
"528","Can we just give a huge applause to @LAIKAStudios for the work they have to do to give us films like Kubo and Missing Link. The hours, the so many frames, the overall dedication they have for their work. I truly enjoyed Missing Link. Had me leaving the theater happy. Thank you!"
"529","subtweet: I would rather see a Paranorman sequel than Missing Link. &gt; &gt;"""
"530","People are turning this whole Missing Link situation into a one sided blame game for people who want more original films. There’s a lot more factors to this story such as the terrible marketing and the fact that not everyone who wants more original films has the time to see it."
"531","All these “You can’t complain about reboots if you haven’t seen Missing Link” hot takes feel very one sided and don’t make the situation better."
"532","@TazoGumball2345 None of these had awful marketing though. People keep saying that despite it being a lie. There were non-stop ads for both of them with Missing Link appearing in front of nearly everything."
"533","In my defense, CARTOON TWITTER COMMUNITY, I'm broke and I wasn't even aware of Missing Link until yesterday <U+0001F644>"
"534","@TheAlphaJayShow I fully agree with this. I want to see The Missing Link, simply because it's Laika and I know they make good stuff, but I fully admit the advertising for it was lackluster and minimal. I wouldn't be surprised if a good chunk of people don't even know this movie exists."
"535","@GaryJMatthews @LovelyAndyUK @GirlyWolfPup Yeah I was uninterested because it looked like... it looked like made-for-TV stuff they were pushing into a theater for some reason. Missing Link looked good, but until I saw a trailer for it in *another movie* last week I didn't even know it existed."
"536","@javi_draws I work at an AMC and they did a decent amount of advertising within AMC for the film (Missing Link themed mango Icee flavor; the poster went up in the hall in November I think, and the 3D glasses bins had ML on it). But that’s only reaching people who are AT the movies already."
"537","I really wanna see Missing Link by Laika. I didn't even know it came out last week."
"538","@mayhem_crimson I've never seen a truer tweet in my life. Missing Link was such a fantastic movie, and so many people are missing out."
"539","I think the reason to why Missing Link bombed is because Laika and its distributor barely marketed the film. People just not seeing it is one thing, but it’s also the company’s responsibility to spread the word on their movie."
"540","OK, I admit, I didn't go out this weekend to see Missing Link as I don't have enough love for Laika (Kubo aside) and animation in general I guess, I was watching two new Netflix series. Small wonder the platform's becoming the new home for original animation."
"541","@spanglemix Missing Link was advertised a lot I feel like? There’s like a bunch of tv ads, there’s ML themed chocolate at Loli &amp; Pops candy stores, it’s constantly posted on Laika’s LinkedIn page, I think it was a promoted tweet at some point"
"542","@unicornmantis Advertising can make or break a movie. Some films don't have a wide appeal either especially ones like The Missing Link. It looks pretty ugly"
"543","So Missing Link is doing really bad at the box office making it another unsuccessful flick for Laika. Normally I'd be really upset about it, but for this one I haven't seen it either. It just looks pretty generic and is surrounded by huge films. The animation looks great but..."
"544","@GirlyWolfPup @Timmy_Mac15 The advertising for Missing Link has been awful. There's billboards around here in rural areas, but just the movie title and a horrible, off-putting picture of the lead character is not a good ad. I was surprised to hear it was a Laika film."
"545","@feyrah Yeah, a big problem is advertising. I only knew Missing Link was coming out because I make it my job to know. <U+0001F62C>"
"546","Seeing a matinee of Missing Link with my wife. The theater is empty, which is kinda sad for the movie, but cool for us"
"547","#StarWarsCelebration is over! What a fun con. I'm excited to get back to a regular sleeping schedule, but first... time to see Missing Link."
"548","@RebelliousEwok Thanks a lot, #Shazam! You killed a great movie! Why do Laika movies never get the box office numbers they deserve? I saw Missing Link, and LOVED it!"
"549","@JeffMovieMan My busy schedule is, unfortunately. <U+0001F622> I do want to see Missing Link, though, and I’m still kicking myself for missing Kubo in theatres."
"550","I’ve... never seen any advertising for Missing Link outside one theatre preview and haven’t heard of The Kid Who Would Be King at all so I,, don’t think the consumers are the issue here?"
"551","@my2k @RebelliousEwok @misterbabadork Kubo was from Focus
Missing Link is their first film with Annapurna"
"552","I REALLY wanted to see these movies and I definitely will see Missing Link; I'm sad that they did so poorly :("
"553","I love Laika but have absolutely no interesting in Missing Link. Coraline and Kubo were fantastic, Box Trolls was meh. Missing Link just does not look good."
"554","Landed early early this morning, slept in, still feel crappy BUT bf and I are gonna see Missing Link today!!!"
"555","@PaintKatt I think unfortunately Missing Link came out at an unfortunate time as well. The entertainment market is super saturated this month with GOT and Avengers Endgame that people might not be able to afford the time or money for everything"
"556","@MollyJongFast Imagine not being able to even grasp the concept of fire and how it works.  These assholes are the jizz that ran down the Missing Link’s leg"
"557","Missing Link (88%) is another humorous, smart and emotional fantasy film from Laika."
"558","@officialtcz I'll for sure catch it in theaters, but Shazam is higher on my priorities list right now. All the ads/trailers for Missing Link just haven't excited me. And the short ads I see on YouTube look like they're aimed at small children and I feel talked down to.
Also, taxes were taxing"
"559","@GirlyWolfPup The King Arthur legend is hardly original. And as for Missing Link, they ads I've seen focus exclusively on the actors doing the voices, as if kids give a shit about Zoe Saldana, instead of jokes and plot from the movie."
"560","@ABagOfSticks @GoldenSmoked We are all going to see Missing Link this weekend"
"561","Saw Missing Link this past weekend. It was fun, but when compared to other Laika films, it was a little lacking in a lot of departments.

However, it was fun, well paced, and while not completely memorable, it’s the kind of film that you’ll remember liking a few years from now."
"562","@GirlyWolfPup The problem is marketing not originality. The only ad I ever came across for Missing Link was a short radio advert that didn’t even convey that it was a movie and Kid Who Would be King was advertised as a movie for small kids. Studios would rather give more to stuff with a base"
"563","Time to see laika's zelda movie! Its weird that they didn't include the name of the series in title, but I guess The Legend Of Zelda: Missing Link doesnt roll off the tongue easy"
"564","@Depressedmovie Missing Link was promoted all over Twitter and in front of Shazam! Captain Marvel Dumbo and How to Train Your Dragon. 

Laika's marketing doesn't get any better than that."
"565","@GirlyWolfPup Maybe the issue is that studios don't market original movies well. Missing Link looks like some of the weakest nothing ever from the ads."
"566","It's such a shame that stop motion movies like Missing Link and Kubo and the Two Strings aren't as financially successful as Pixar movies!"
"567","@feyrah @AtroxChobatsu I saw quite a lot on Missing Link on Facebook and a lot on the other film in Cinemas only. For some reason they just had...very specifically narrow advertising, no wonder they flopped..."
"568","I’m getting tired of people making others feel bad for not seeing Missing Link. Original movies are not a charity and if you want to see them strive stop judging others for doing nothing wrong. Instead blame the marketers for not doing their job."
"569","@GirlyWolfPup @TeaRexee Unfortunately, like everyone else is saying, it was the marketing that killed them.
I saw a single ad for the Missing Link months and months ago, and wanted to see it, but I never saw anything for it after that, so I just completely forgot about it."
"570","@Skylerhxc You’re right that the film had trailers in front of bigger films, and twitter, but that’s all there was. These days that feels like bare minimum, especially sandwiched between 2 Marvels and a DC movie.

I liked Missing Link a lot, but UAR needed to do more to get it an audience."
"571","At the cinema to see Missing Link. In the mood for something cute and light, plus Kubo &amp; The Two Strings was soooo good."
"572","@kaitlynkelley57 @DORKpodcast @RVonD It’s not awful, most of the little shits went to Dumbo or Missing Link, still more children than I’d like, but the movie isn’t in the Lux so I gotta sit with all the plebs, not used to going to movies and not being able to order a drink at my seat"
"573","@GirlyWolfPup @MESIAS_ROCKET Shit. I didnt even know Missing Link was out. Totes gonna watch it this weekend"
"574","I remember seeing a ton of ads for Missing Link a few months back, then none again until this past week."
"575","To be fair, Missing Link, compared to the other Laika Productions, was poorly advertised. I'm a Laika fan and I hadn't seen a single ad for ML until I checked Laika's website, even worse, it had no release date posted so how were we supposed to know it was gonna come out so&gt;"
"576","I do find it sad that Missing Link isn't doing well, but to me it's just expected at this point since Laika has never been a money making company. It's silly to me at this point to really tell people ""GO SEE THIS MOVIE"" because writings on the wall."
"577","Missing Link bombing at the box office is why I truly don't love anyone."
"578","Saw ""The Missing Link"" the other day. Can't even begin to go into awe about the craft &amp; love put into this film. Lots to love about it, &amp; Susan is endearing. It is worth a watch.
More detailed thoughts:"
"579","I really enjoyed Missing Link! Absolutely gorgeous, fun and exciting animation, and an airtight script. It just... could have been funnier? It had jokes throughout, but never made me laugh out loud repeatedly until the final act."
"580","Feel bad that Missing Link is bombing hard in the box office, but I honestly had no interest in it going off of the trailers they put out so I imagine loads of people felt the same. That and it always seem like Laika films can never do well in theaters regardless"
"581","@feyrah @AtroxChobatsu This is so true, I've been looking forward to Missing Link since the first trailer and I didn't even know it premiered till the other day."
"582","I saw Missing Link by @LAIKAStudios on opening weekend. Wow, great movie and beautiful animation as always!

But I am sad that a dumpster-fire like Hellboy makes more at box office than this work of art...
