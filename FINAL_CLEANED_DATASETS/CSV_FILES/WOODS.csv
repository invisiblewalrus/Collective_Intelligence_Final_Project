"1","This is the weekend of LITTLE WOODS, FAST COLOR, RAFIKI, and HAIL SATAN? You wanna see more women directing movies? Support them at the theater and elsewhere."
"2","Neither Little Woods or Fast Color are playing in my city and I am distraught."
"3","Real talk: #LittleWoods should get as much attention as The Rider"
"4","They do love exploring.... letting them roam as you follow make you see new things too. I love going into the woods with little ones."
"5","Seeing #LittleWoods for a second time this weekend. Go see this and learn some things. Also because @TessaThompson_x and @NiaDaCosta"
"6","LITTLE WOODS is an impressive directorial debut from Nia DaCosta featuring powerful performances from Tessa Thompson &amp; Lily James. Two sisters not bonded by blood but by love, just trying to survive &amp; get by in contemporary North Dakota. Great tension, empathy &amp; song choices."
"7","@TessaThompson_x @ava I saw Little Woods a few weeks ago at a screening and it blew me away! Tessa, next to Mississippi Damned, this is one of your best dramatic roles to date. You were fantastic"
"8","Little Woods is taut, blunt and political in all the best ways. Tessa Thompson might be giving a career best performance, which is saying something considering how brilliant she always is. This is a GREAT debut for Nia DaCosta! Go see this film! In LA it’s playing @NuartTheatre."
"9","Women supporting women. And great content!"
"10","Directed by women alert:"
"11","AMERICANS - TO YOUR CINEMAS. I wish we had all these movies in the UK right now. I can't see them, you should."
"12","Match report and full interview Sunday Sportsbeat with Eoin Beatty 2pm. #Kildare #camogie"
"13","REPORT: @KildareCamogie defeat @LimCamogie in Littlewoods Division Three @OfficialCamogie League decider!"
"14","RT Nikyatu: ""We shot [‘Little Woods’] for half the budget I wanted. You're forced into these very scarce resources [for] being a woman or…"
"15","I have never been in one of them, but the other - Littlewoods - is all about small farms, free range, very good quality meat.  On a Saturday there is always a queue for its counter.  For the quality, the prices seen reasonable."
"16","@katiewalshstx It kills me that it’s not playing anywhere near me. I don’t have this or “Little Woods”. (Or literally any of the other women directed films that opened), so I just had to watch “Someone Great” yesterday."
"17","@realDonaldTrump Hillary is going to prison, and Obama is not out of the woods. It’s going to be magnificent watching all the leftist idiots on this thread as their mushy little heads begin to explode."
"18","Total side note but I’m such a big fan of @TheValerieJune so I totally flipped when her song came on in the beginning! She’s a fellow diabetic like me, @dj_diabeatic. 

#LittleWoods"
"19","Does he really lack athleticism or does he lack desire to get the most out of his ability? (In a weight room with guys like Metcalf, AJB, Woods, Webster..) Either answer is pretty damning"
"20","Little Woods may be a fictional place but these characters have a similar story to so many women living in poverty, who have to constantly be on guard from men while protecting their health."
"21","HIGH LIFE was super rad. CONCRETE ruled. CLIMAX was gnarly. PADDLETON wrecked me (was admittedly a big gamble for the day of my uncle’s funeral). US was fun. Anything I’ve missed so far this year? Gonna do PETERLOO and LITTLE WOODS this week, missed the KNIFE + HEART screening."
"22","I thought these were cute nicknames for disney movies at first and I spent more time than I care to admit trying to figure out what Hail Satan was lol"
"23","@KatTimpf Yeah, having to walk out of the house and down a path through the woods to a little building with a half moon on the door"
"24","@BambinoPearce @EdKrassen Nope guy you need to get out a little deeper in the woods but we will see. You might make it if you ease back into sanity mode instead of letting him push the buttons. Y’all are playing into his hands like that. He’s nearly crippled the media because of it"
"25","""Tessa Thompson and Lily James give breathtaking performances."" - Village Voice. Nia DaCosta's acclaimed directorial debut #LittleWoods is now playing in theaters."
"26","@ethan1655 @quail4ever When we first moved to the house we live in now there was a nice covey around. Use to see them in the edge of woods at the back yard and at the little creek area at my lower neighbors. I bet it's been at least 20 years since I've heard one around here.<U+0001F44D><U+0001F44A>"
"27","@ADuralde @AWolfeful Little Woods just started its run at my local Landmark this week and I'm excited to check it out."
"28","@CxnineStrxder “Increased agression rather than backing away and trying to play things off, a slightly unnatural increase in ear hair, little things like that. Not to mention hearing about a man barreling into the woods late last during the festival.”"
"29","I’m gonna be ringing in Taurus season in a cute little spot out in the woods drinking and smoking and eating with a Taurus next weekend and I can’t WAIT"
"30","Little Woods is so good, I had the good fortune to see it at @TribecaFilm last spring. Need to figure out how I’m going to see Fast Color because it’s Lorraine Toussaint and Gugu Mbatha-Raw in the same movie."
"31","@courtdanee2 Sis little woods is playing in one theatre in the entire state of Illinois <U+0001F62D>, a true limited release, I'm so sad"
"32","@courtdanee2 I never had an indie movie not even make it to the city of Chicago, Little Woods is playing in a random suburb lol. Lowkey what's the point, I wonder if they tried to get it straight to streaming and no one was biting?"
"33","Our best bet is that Fast Color and Little Woods hit a streaming service soon afterwards so that they can get more eyeballs. Atleast both Nia Dacosta and Julia Hart have more accessible upcoming films after this (Candyman and Disney's Stargirl)"
"34","Hey @AMCTheatres -there's a ton of movies out by female directors rn- Hail, Satan, Fast Color, Little Woods, Rafiki, Wild Nights w/ Emily, High Life, Be Natural &amp; probably more I'm missing. But I don't see any of them playing at my local AMCs (I live in a little hamlet called LA."
"35","@TessaThompson_x amazing work in
#LittleWoods"
"36","Trying to catch both of these! For real, tho."
"37","@ava @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x YES!!! Saw #FastColor today...loved it!!! So proud of this movie and all that made it happen. Seeing #LittleWoods next!"
"38","This is beautiful. Pay it forward. I love it. @MatthewACherry is the best."
"39","am i dreaming or did this really just happen? <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>"
"40","This is why artists using their platform to support the work of other artists is everything. Thank you @ava  from the bottom of my heart. #fastcolor #littlewoods"
"41","Haven’t seen Fast Color yet, but @NiaDaCosta’s @LittleWoodsFilm is great. Tessa and Lily are both so good in it."
"42","This. All of this right here."
"43","Two for two out of my Florida Film Festival picks this year. Her Smell and Vita &amp; Virginia both fantastic. Sad time got away from me and I missed Little Woods, but can’t wait to catch it soon. Also fuck yeah, women-made and women-led films being so strong this year."
"44","Hot damn am I enjoying a weekend of black excellence. First Fast Color, currently Homecoming, hopefully Little Woods tomorrow."
"45","Hot damn am I enjoying a weekend of black excellence. First Lizzo's Cuz I Love You, then Fast Color, currently Homecoming, hopefully Little Woods tomorrow."
"46","Listen to the lady"
"47","Saw a preview for this before Hellboy and honestly I was and am surprised I haven't heard endless support and talk about it! 

WoC with powers! @BlackGirlNerds"
"48","i just wanna live in a cottage in the woods with my little gnome friends"
"49","She continues walking around looking down a little mad.

"51","@AWolfeful In the middle of a Little Woods/High Life double feature tonight at the theater. Going to see Hail Satan at @alamodrafthouse when their Film Club series shows it."
"52","@thetrudz I was very fortunate enough to see Little Woods and High Life last night, Southeast Texas."
"53","We love Tessa Thompson"
"54","Agree. Both excellent. Was so pleased to have opened @Athenafilmfest this year with Fast Color."
"55","@ava @RealGDT @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x The little indie theater I manage in Asbury Park, NJ is the only theater in the state showing Little Woods. It’s fantastic. Proud to be able to share it with people."
"56","Who wants to go?"
"57","Little Woods is happening tomorrow. Fast Color isn’t playing by me <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"58","I’m really heated because I didn’t even know about Little Woods until Friday and I’ve only found, like, 2 theaters running Fast Color. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????!"
"59","Agreed!  Both movies are awesome!  Great suggestions.  Loved them both!"
"60","I’m mad LITTLE WOODS is playing nowhere near me <U+0001F612> I’ve been reading all things @NiaDaCosta today. This black creative is definitely inspired by her."
"61","2 of the best at it"
"62","The little one is wandering out of the woods, clearly confused and upset. If the tear tracks on her cheek were any indication."
"63","Tytan bought a little baby chick home from the Easter party and it’s about to get sent out to the woods already <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F425> it keeps chirping"

"66","""Anchored by two incredible performances."" - Slashfilm. Tessa Thompson and Lily James star in #LittleWoods. Now playing in theaters."
"67","trouble. Then, my grandma proceeds to show the younger girls a picture of Madi when she was little literally pooping in the woods. 1) why would you even take a picture like that? 2) why would you make a fucking scrapbook page surrounding the picture and 3) why"
"68","Neon's LITTLE WOODS began its journey dealing $66k in 33 theaters, $2k per. Not the sort of numbers that warrant much expansion, unfortunately."
"69","@AggieSlyFox07 @SmithyGingers @cnnbrk Hi. My name is Eric. I'd like to be the first to welcome you to this little neck of the woods. We call it Earth.

Where are you from?"
"70","#OpenRP

(Little Marvin was just taking a little walk through the woods,trying to keep his mind away from everything) “this new place sure is weird...everybody is....very friendly...”*voice changes* “I DON’T LIKE THAT”"
"71","I was all dressed, after finally convincing myself to go out.

Then mom came home, saw me all butch dressy, asked where I was going, and I panicked, and said nowhere.<U+0001F480>"
"72","I don't really want to leave the house. On the other hand, #Rafiki, #LittleWoods, and #FastColorMovie are all available tomorrow.

Each in a different theatre, but still.<U+0001F623>"
"73","@ava @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x Little Woods is devastatingly beautiful! I loved it!"
"74","I wish #FastColorMovie and #LittleWoods were playing in my area so I could support. <U+0001F614>"
"75","I’ve seen both and they are extraordinary."
"76","@ava @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x Just got out of FAST COLOR and saw LITTLE WOODS a few weeks back. Trying to get the word out!!!"
"77","apparently were at least getting wild nights with emily in the middle of may but little woods, fast color, rafiki, doesnt seem promising that theyll make it here"
"78","none of these are open anywhere near me im in hell"
"79","@AlyxCrane Remember the “hike” in the woods with the whole walking sticks and it was over a little paved trail. I can’t. <U+0001F602>"
"80","I really hope Little Woods plays beyond just this week in LA, at another Landmark or a Laemmle perhaps. It’s one of the year’s best and deserves to be seen. On a similar note, I hope Fast Color plays beyond this week too because otherwise I’m afraid I might miss it in theaters."
"81","3) First greens: Two types, cuds we chew like little deers in the woods. Romaine lettuce, butter lettuce, cabbage, finely chopped brussel sprouts, spinach are all characters. None of these really have a ton of flavor so mix as you please. They've got spicy cousins though"
"82","Little Woods was so beautiful. Tessa Thompson and Lily James were a damn force in that movie"
"83","OKAY SO mezzo” au where yokai tamaki finds lost toddler sougo in the the woods and takes him under his wing, raising and caring for him as if he were his little brother until he sougo is found again by humans and adopted back into human society. tamaki’s heart breaking as-"
"84","Brought my little family to stay in a cabin in the woods for a few nights.  We are scary af lol"
"85","I'm mad neither one of these movies are playing her in Indianapolis."

"90","“While there are more women working, we definitely get less money ... We shot [‘Little Woods’] for half the budget I wanted. You're forced into these very scarce resources [for] being a woman or a person of color and then you're told to be extraordinary.”"
"91","@FBrownWilliams @Jimmyspolitics LOL. My quest this year is eliminating fire ants.  They are considerably guilty for the extreme disintegration of the quail population. I’m out to fix that in my little neck of the woods. Some call it a fools quest.  We’ll let the results speak.  :)"
"92","Need to see this."
"93","@jamie_castle96 My experience was of when i was 7/8 Luton won the little woods cup (league cup) then we moved from Luton to derby and Luton got relegated to division 1 which is now the championship. Im dreaming of ltfc vs dcfc next season 3 games to go #COYH"
"94","@ava @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x Just got back from Little Woods. It was great. Q&amp;A with the Nia. She's quite funny and sweet."

"97","I'm like that god-giant at the end of Cabin in the Woods. If you all entertain me on Twitter to sate my fury, I will let the world continue a little longer."
"98","Heartbreaking to see my home moor ablaze. If you needed proof of climate change impacting us all, it’s this. Unseasonably dry spring with little rain, hot April. Moors, like deciduous woods are ‘normally’ fairly fire resistant thanks to moss and damp peatland ecosystems. Not now."
"99","We went, the two of us, into
The woods behind the little school"
"100","white bitches are psycho"
"101","That's what I'm saying, when Hoffa disappeared in 1975 there would have been about twenty square miles of woods with this tooling shop right in the middle of it down the street from where they were digging for ""The little tool shed"" seven years ago."
"102","That's what I'm saying, when Hoffa disappeared in 1975 there would have beenvl about twenty square miles of woods with this tooling shop right in the middle of it down the street from where they were digging for ""The little tool shed"" seven years ago."
"103","Check with the Oakland County Clerk. The foundation for the structure was first poured in 1968. It was the only little tool shed in the middle of the woods back then up there for twenty-five square miles."
"104","Yes, apparently right before they all died in prison they told the FBI th at they buried Hoffa under Jack's little tool shed at the back if his property up by where his horses were. Look, in '75 you pretty much had twenty square miles of woods and this tooling shop."
"105","Either way, I'm terrified. They were looking for ""The little tool shed"" and the only place around for about twenty square miles in the middle of the woods was this tooling shop and they couldn't figure it out."
"106","Yes, apparently right before they all died in prison they told the FBI that they buried Hoffa under Jack's little tool shed at the back if his property up by where his horses were. Look, in '75 you pretty much had twenty square miles of woods and this tooling shop."
"107","I'm just saying, completely exonerated...these investigators couldn't even find the little tool shed and it was the only place there in the middle of the woods for twenty-five square miles. Okay?"
"108","I'm just saying, if these investigators can't find the little tool shed in the middle of the woods that the people who killed Hoffa were talking about in prison before they died then they're crooks. It was the only only place there. They probably built the whole Hazel Park track."
"109","I feel like a stereotypical republican trying to explain to a bunch lawyers who can't understand in this day and age. In 1975 there were twenty square miles of woods and this tool shop. That's your little tool shed."
"110","Also, they 'normally' are managed properly, but this one has been massively neglected. Partially due to cuts to funding, partially due to Bradford council's lack of care."
"111","When the water runs out..."
"112","@mancity_ray @MoonbeamMcfc Like LFC got when the Moores Littlewoods pools family pulled out of Liverpool?"
"113","@transalpino We had lots of Littlewoods Pools nights out in there late 80s but I was always that bladdered I have no recollection of it"
"114","I saw both this weekend and admire each -- reviewed #fastcolor for @pajiba and will have a review of #littlewoods for @AWFJ later today."

"117","I think this is something I like to watch."
"118","Currently in Columbus theaters: Little Woods played for only one night at the local indie place
High Life and Fast Color are nowhere in sight
AMC is playing Peterloo in a pretty regular rotation"
"119","may have to go through and do a lonely cinema trip to little woods"
"120","If you're in NYC and want to see a movie this weekend: Khalik Allah's meditative portrait of Jamaica, Black Mother, is playing Museum of the Moving Image. Nia DaCosta's lovely debut feature on life in the time of opioids, Little Woods, just opened at Angelika and Landmark 57."
"121","@ImjustagirlJm Happy Easter; hopefully the woods will dry a little before you venture out; take care and happy hunting."
"122","heterophobia boy got lost in the woods so now he and little bro are friends"
"123","@SDunlapiii I’ve dug a little through the years but not any large amount. I usually transplant it in my woods if I dig any lol"
"124","I bet he sleeps in it. Bless his little comeback heart."
"125","Terrifying to see sights like this this early in the year."
"126","Can we be a little more concerned there’s a human carcass out there in the woods?"
"127","@jack_murley @RogueTheatreUK I love Rogue Theatre’s productions in Tehidy Woods - took the little nieces a year or so ago and I had even more fun than they did"
"128","I will watch anything you make or suggest"
"129","Seeing both of these this week, back to back. Ready to be shook."
"130","@ERCboxoffice Compared to other Neon films that were released in about 30(+) theaters, Little Woods opening bigger than Revenge ($45,924) but less than Risk ($76,327) &amp; The Bad Batch ($89,111)"
"131","Saw this last year at Tribeca and it was really good. Shoutout to @NiaDaCosta &amp; @TessaThompson_x (Tessa made it a point to stop and get a drop for me as the carpet was closing <U+0001F64C><U+0001F3FE>)"
"132","I lived in Edmonton that was the first time I experienced racism. Mill woods mall. My son was 3 held a little girls hand to help her on the play equipment at the indoor gym.  Was not a white right wing supremacist telling me that I and my son were dirty kafir."
"133","Mayflowering opened some time ago, and last week, although ice formed sufficiently strong to bear a good sized cat, yet this delicate little emblem of our province was seen in shaded nooks, peeping out as if saying, ‘we bloom amid the snow.’ Woods Harbour Apr 21 1890"
"134","Would a cat go on the ice though? Or be more sensible this time of year? Getting stuck on weak ice is much more a dog thing."
"135","@RiRiRi_84 Hi there, our prices do reflect the flexible payment options we have at Littlewoods. Please keep an eye on the website for regular deals and promotions. Best wishes, Toni"
"136","Lol to think I saw #LittleWoods and #TheBurialofKojo within days of each other one at the @SchomburgCenter the other @brooklynmuseum. Two of my favorites this year. Also #LittleMovie and #UsMovie were great movies."

"138","Fast Color and Little Woods are both movies I'd really love to see very soon. But the extremely limited release means they'll never make it to a theater in my city."
"139","@ava @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x Little Woods looks great and will definitely see it, but I'm avoiding every and any word about Fast Color because I know it's sci-fi drama with Mbatha Raw and that's all I need before seeing it<U+0001F49C><U+0001F49C>"
"140","@TessaThompson_x let’s discuss showing little woods in more theaters. I want it"
"141","@Trunch81 Awesome mate and a really great atmosphere around it, walking though the dense (in parts) woods along a little stream and then at the end that pops up.  Apparently built 1147. Love anything like that <U+0001F44D>"

"143","Just bought my tickets to see Little Woods for the second time already. <U+0001F60C> @NiaDaCosta @TessaThompson_x"

"145","He always one touch away from a calamity. I pity the coach because he has so little options left on the bench. There’re so many dead woods in the Arsenal rank. How much are they paid for making up the numbers in training?"
"146","Indeed we do... since childhood... this is a place to walk &amp; breath deeply the smell of the woods..kick the fallen leaves .... see Little Lake Chipican... see the wildflowers and listen for the birds... connect with a friend, a child or spouse...or do none of that and just be...."

"153","Toronto movie theatres — we getting eyes on these?"
"154","This weekend there are black-woman-directed-movie options. Little, Little Woods, And Fast Color. Rememadat!"
"155","LITTLE WOODS tops off my weekend. @NiaDaCosta navigates sisterhood through poverty and broken systems, and challenges us to think about the choices we land on when we have none. Tessa Thompson and Lily James are deeply affecting: tragic and resilient."
"156","One of the many things that HER SMELL, FAST COLOR, SOMEONE GREAT, and LITTLE WOODS share that really stuck with me was how the relationships between women change. Life will put you on your path, and you can't always take those relationships with you, as much as you might want to."

"177","@utheriN @MihrThakar Below expectations.... not out of the woods yet. Heavy clouds are  forming but with little follow-through rainfall"
"178","Not to be a dick but imagine rolling out for a movie simply because of the race/gender of its director"

"180","I’ll be going o see #FastColor this weekend to support @juliahartowitz:) and to impress @ava <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> Congrats Jules!!!!!"
"181","Little Woods isn't showing anywhere near me and I am very disappointed, I need to see it"
"182","@CllrDanMcD @medway_council @naushabahkhan @ClivJoh @CllrAndyStamp @PatCoop91879588 @AdamNthgill @MedwayLabour This. Was in Gillingham for a service at St Marks on Thursday night. Littlewoods Car Park strewn with months worth of litter. And I had to pay for the privilege. And move my car after two hours. Its like the council don't care about Gillingham because poor people."
"183","Going today to see Fast Color!"
"184","So done with this. Gillingham deserves better"
"185","Why does Kimmage still get to write for papers? Joyless take filled with references to rumours about Tiger’s personal life (he doesn’t tip apparently, who cares?!) and if he has “changed”. Not edgy, not controversial, just bitter."
"186","A man begs the PCs to find his daughter lost in the woods.  After a few hours in the forest, they find the same man--now in a wig--claiming to be a lost little girl.

He swears he just wanted to feel important enough to be rescued by heroes.

"187","@franklinleonard And complicating the equation is the fact it was released same weekend as Little Woods."
"188","This is so very sad to see <U+0001F614>  I expect it was started deliberately by school children as it's the holidays, happens every time they are off!  Thank god they are going back to school this week!  #Menace"
"189","Can def relate to this ....

""Well, what do you think?"" I asked.

He face was a portrait of confusion and despair.

""I feel nothing,"" he said."
"190","But will they be in theaters near anyone?"
"191","@wwmtnews Read:

I am as miserable and scared as a little girl lost in the woods at night."
"192","Little Woods picks a fascinating backdrop (North Dakota’s energy boom) for its tale of healthcare-driven economic desperation, and Tessa Thompson is very good. Would it’ve killed somebody to turn a light on?"
"193","@PaulKimmage it’s really getting embarrassing for you now Paul, the chips on your shoulders begrudge any sportsman achieving anything, @TigerWoods is the greatest we have ever seen. You admitted to cheating at your chosen sport, being controversial is all you have left #verysad"
"194","In @MatthewACherry fashion, I’m buying somewone a ticket to go watch Little Woods 4:30! at Nuart Theatre. SUPPORT BLACK WOMEN IN FILM!!!"
"195","@TessaThompson_x yup just drove 40 miles to do it and see this movie <U+0001F62C> #LittleWoods"
"196","Gots to go!!!"
"197","@Ironhorse76 Filthy little pagan that I am, I spent the day in the only church I know. I hope walked, heart open and spirit joyful, through the newly greening woods, foraged nettles and fiddleheads, picked up trash left by less grateful humans, and prayed just by breathing. <U+0001F496><U+0001F300><U+0001F496>"
"198","@Danger1652 I have a little surprise for you next month it has something to do with a suit wearing long arms and legs and a few woods I found in on Xbox for just 1,99€ so just you wait"
"199","Fast Color was amazing. A thoroughly well written and excellently acted movie today told a beautiful story of healing, growth, and trust. 

Highly recommend!"
"200","@ValerieComplex Yeah. I read the real number was 25 maybe and that it will only play until the end of the weeks. Little Woods isn't doing much better."
"201","Little Woods and Fast Colors got released in only eight places I swear."
"202","See @juliahartowitz film #FastColor in theaters now."
"203","Little Bit of Lovin by Roy Woods is so groovy ugh I adore it"
"204","@HarleyQuinnRN You’re a better woman than I am! I constantly fall off the diet wagon, drag it into the woods, set it on fire, and use the insurance money to buy Little Debbie snacks. I need to lose a large amount. Literally 100 pounds."
"205","@X3MN45 /He's relieved at the least at their acceptance.
/He can only take so much;

/With the little ones in tow he lets the shadows guide his steps and makes way through the woods to their destination, stepping out to where Xemnas is settled.

...
Well..
There are worse places to hide."
"206","Getting a chance to see both #HighLife  and #LittleWoods  this weekend really made a great time at the movies . With #LittleWoods  really blowing me a way"

"208","Irish sports writing is in the absolute gutter. Don't exactly see the point of this article? Other than to poke fun at Tiger really. Kimmage and his wannabe mate MacKenna genuinely haven't a clue about the sports they cover and thrive off controversy. Pair of losers."
"209","Super dejected and broken about job prospects and being shot down, so playing some of my steam backlog to heal a little, started with Night in the Woods, and man, that is not what I need right now. Tabling that one..."
"210","@TribridOfChaos ""Are you sure we're going to a movie or to a woods to be the plot of a horror movie?"" 

He asked with a joking tone. He liked the time spent with her but didn't exactly want to get lost. The last time he was lost he died.

""We could at least drive around A little bit."""
"211","Through-backs: The (not so) little fox stuck in the woods, tried to survive and learn things. He feels thankful and blessed with a new clusters, the hopes, watching the old ones finally jumped over the rocks.

"212","@valkyrieIoki She's really going? I thought she would be busy with promoting Little Woods!"
"213","I can't wait to learn and see much more from @NiaDaCosta.  I can't wait to see her upcoming movie. #littlewoods"
"214","We have two strong films out this weekend with @juliahartowitz's #FastColor and @NiaDaCosta's #LittleWoods. Go see both of them!"
"215","@ava @gugumbatharaw @LPToussaint @TessaThompson_x Two festival favorites from last year! I can't be more prouder of my quote appearing in the Little Woods trailer!"
"216","Three of these are playing @mdffparkway"
"217","Most of these aren’t available near me but if you live in a bigger city that has any of these films, please go check them out!! Looking at you, my LA and NYC friends especially."
"218","More interviews and (hopefully) some good news on some job leads starting tomorrow and for the rest of the week, but not out of the woods yet.  Still wrestling in trying to cover a car insurance and rent payment while out of work.  Any little bit that can be spared helps a lot."
"219","Saw #LittleWoods yesterday, #FastColor today, and hoping to hit the trifecta with #Rafiki tomorrow. Support Indie Films, support Female Filmakers, and support #BlackGirlMagic"

"223","@GeeScottSr @TheMikeSalk Using Woods as an argument against competition being the main reason is a little bit of a crutch... he is a generational anomaly when it comes to his transcending his sport. Don’t let the outlier of all outliers be your go to arguement for that, weakens your actual point."
"224","Also how the hell are there only 2 theaters in the LA area showing LITTLE WOODS? This is a crime."
"225","Here's to more and many, and many and more, and MORE and MANY. . .worlds of talent. x"
