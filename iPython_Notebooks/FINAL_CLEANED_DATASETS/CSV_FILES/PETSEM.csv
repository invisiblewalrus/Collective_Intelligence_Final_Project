"390","Lesson learned from watching the new Pet Sematary: I’m never having kids cause they could die and come back and kill me"
"391","Saw Pet Sematary. Won’t be going out in the woods for a while"
"392","Ok so pet sematary thoughts...... hmmmmmmmm"

"395","Heard that the original “Gage” was to play Jud’s role in tbe remake. See that it went to Lithgow, however, as indicated in the trailer. I see what ya mean."
"396","Ok but on a serious note I need someone to go with me to see 5 feet apart and pet sematary"
"397","Going to see @petsematarymov tonight!!"
"398","I have just watched the film Pet Sematary (1989). My verdict: it sucks ass"
"399","@jonah_kaufman Previews for Pet Sematary look like a frame for frame copy of the original IMO."
"400","About to see Pet Sematary. Pissed that a group of college kids just showed up. C'est la vie."
"401","#PetSematary is kinda just meh... the scares are good. But the characters are so one-dimensional that you just don’t care about anything that happens to them."
"402","@ASavageNation I see that Pet Sematary is getting a remake."
"403","Pet Sematary = creepy af and I’m so not going to sleep tonight"
"404","I didn't like the first film interpretation to #PetSematary  but this new one I quite enjoyed"
"405","Also Ka: I didn’t like #PetSematary it’s an OK movie but it is another perfect example of: “the book is always way better”"
"406","Morning: My wife tells me to go watch #Shazam, ”I know you want to watch #PetSematary but I don’t like terror movie”, I said OK.

Night: the cinema guys cancelled Shazam projection for technical issues, we ended watching Pet Sematary.

That’s #KA in action maggots!"
"407","It would be really, really funny if the new Pet Sematary had an unabashedly happy ending"
"408","For want of judicious traffic calming measures, the cat was killed 

For want of good judgement, the cat was reanimated and lured kids to the same poorly engineered road 

The tragedies of “Pet Sematary” were preventable!"
"409","REALLY liked the twist on ""Pet Sematary."" No, I'm not interested in why you hated it or why this part or that part isn't like the original.  That was kind of the point.  Stephen King said it was, and I quote, ""fucking great"" and it's HIS book. Good enough for meeee!"
"410","@petsematarymov Oh look!  Yet ANOTHER remake.
Honestly are y'all running out of ideas?"
"411","@thatsMRSgreen2u I made it 20 minutes and left. I tried seeing pet sematary but all the startle scenes were so loud they woke her up and everyone was glaring at me."
"412","Going to see pet sematary"
"413","Just saw #PetSematary it was trash a total downgrade of a @StephenKing classic, horrible writing and over the top for no reason though in its defense the actors were phenomenal #SMH"
"414","Can't believe they made a new Pet Sematary and it wasn't to fix the spelling."
"415","after seeing pet sematary all i have to say is fuck them kids"
"416","About too watch #PetSematary hope it doesn’t disappoint"
"417","Punked out of Pet Sematary an hour and a half in because I remembered the book ending and couldn’t handle seeing it with my eyes. I haven’t gotten too scared to finish a movie since I was a teen, but that story is ruthless and everything looked too real <U+0001F630>"
"418","Sarah and I just watched pet sematary <U+0001F974><U+0001F629><U+0001F630>"

This... is NOT my cat. 

#yikes #creepy #pushycat @StephenKing"
"430","Just seen @petsematarymov Was excellent. Great adaption of a great book. Also, great song during the credits @StephenKing"
"431","@GOATIERREZ_ bro this part shits on the whole remake lol"
"432","Pet Sematary thoughts: it was really well done but I'm disappointed that they completely changed the ending, what in the fresh hell tbh"
"433","What the fuck did I just watch #PetSematary"
"434","@petsematarymov me and my two friends just saw Pet Sematary and we all literally had a panic attack. Love it and recommend it"
"435","Pet Sematary here we go. Buckle up and get dirty, let’s see where this installment of Stephen Kings classic takes us!"
"436","But at the same time (I just got done watching Pet Sematary) people feel like they need more time. Time is not linear. So we have to accept that his physical form is no more. But his spirit is alive and well and will continue to be on this earth until all the work is done."
"437","#PetSematary Remake has more gore and slow burn dread, simultaneously, though overall it's still a perfunctory remake. Directors tried to weave ""past sins"" plot, but comes  off as rather silly. The big drastic change did make a decent home invasion part, tho #GoodEntertainment"
"438","Excited for #PetSematary with my movie squad"
"439","Pet Sematary was about your average horror film. I should say that I never saw the original or read the book and the trailer giving away a certain death really took away from the film. Otherwise it was competently made, just nothing surprising."
"440","saw #PetSematary loved it now time to catch up on #NXTTakeOver"
"441","Worked on @TheMaryLambert movie #Siesta and that opening shot with @EllenBarkin on the runway still takes my breath away #hirewomen #ReFrame"
"442","#PetSematary 2019 is better than the original. I really enjoyed it!"
"443","It's 4:30 and I'm at work thinking of the best way to make a Us and Pet Sematary double feature happen when I visit ramo"
"444","Pet Sematary was pretty good. Was kinda slow at first but it picked up. Liked that it switched up and didn’t completely copy the original movie."
"445","Bout to see what this @petsematarymov is all about with the homie #coleslaw! <U+0001F61D><U+0001F479><U+0001F47B> #PetSemetary"

"447","the shining bikin depresyon"
"448","Just saw the Pet Sematary 2019 remake. I see a bonus episode in our future..."
"449","#PetSematary What a let down. This film didn't live up to its name. This film lacked vision, creativity, suspense, and purpose. We got was the cute version of #AnnabelleComesHome Dont bring me back to life to watch this film again... <U+0001F47B><U+0001F480>"
"450","I am so disappointed with #PetSematary <U+0001F611>"

"452","#PetSematary was awesome. Haven’t jumped like that in a while! They really did a great job. I’d see it again! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>"
"453","@SharnaLC_ @petsematarymov Original...or watch the first half of the new one and leave before the truck scene"
"454","@mattyjets @petsematarymov First horror film I’ve ever walked out on."
"455","New #PetSematary not impressed.  Way too many liberties taken.  Deviates too much from the source material.  Couple of good scares though.  PS, original Church was much creepier."
"456","#PetSematary  might also be on tonight's viewing list if i can fit 2 movies in today"
"457","pet sematary is the sickest movie ever"
"458","@YouDaManTiger It was fantastic!  Hi Mom was just wow..  thought the end was cool too.  Definitely seeing several times before endgame. Pet Sematary was good too"
"459","The new Pet Sematary is awful. Save your money. It’s way worse than the 1989 version."
"460","So the moral of @petsematarymov is to keep your indoor cat an INDOOR cat like a responsible pet owner, not an indoor/outdoor cat, otherwise your child will become a murderous hell demon."
"461","the fitst picture makes me sing SMELLY CAATTTT SMELLY CATTT WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOUU"
"462","@BeyondFest @petsematarymov @starryguys I think I traumatized my 12 year old daughter today taking her! She is now ready for @BeyondFest this year!! Jete Laurence is a goddamn legend"
"463","Watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force to counteract the achilles scene in the new ‘pet sematary’"
"464","Just saw Pet Sematary and maybe this is the Wildcat in me talking, but honestly the amount of promotion UMaine is getting from that movie is ridiculous."
"465","Saw #Shazam tonight and I quite enjoyed it! A perfectly good movie to start off the 2019 movie season with. Up next on my list is #PetSematary"
"466","Going to see this"
"467","I thought #PetSematary was trending because horror freaks like me were being extra freaky online but there’s a remake which I’m about to watch. :)"
"468","#PetSematary is a well made horror movie with chilling visuals - but I regret it has as much soul as the dead it ressurects - I dare say the filmmakers were more focused on what they wanted to change than what made the story #TheFilmIsSour #SometimesMorePlotIsBetter"
"469","Pet Sematary was creepy af. And might I add, I always said once someone dies I NEVER WANNA SEE THEM. That’s so scary lol. This movie further proved my point."
"470","""From the King of Horror"" :D"
"471","finishing up the original pet sematary. everything is the daddy’s fault. that is all."
"472","#PetSematary review: The film is a dud. The story is a mess. The acting isn't strong. More laughs than scares in this ""horror"" flick."
"473","@_GCFBunny_ But I mean he’s offering to pay my ticket to see the new Pet Sematary and he’s gonna buy me food so I kinda won w this

And I don’t even have to sleep with him or anything so it’s even better"
"474","just because of this self-complain of mine, i’m bringing back my longest, most pretentious review to that, and of course it had to be an LVT film"
"475","The original #PetSematary is on @AMC_TV When Gage got hit by that truck was &amp; still is devastating! He should’ve been watching that baby!!"
"476","The cat in @petsematarymov deserves an Oscar"
"477","Ok the movie Pet Sematary was nuts.. but what’s more nuts is that I really believe CEMETERY was spelled “sematary” I’ve never hated myself more"
"478","I still don't want to be buried in a #PetSematary"
"479","Go home, or catch this 1230 Pet Sematary screening."

"485","i wanna go see pet sematary but i’m not tryna be in there solo with all the couples <U+0001F612>"
"486","Update I know it wasn’t really scary but it is considered a Thriller/Horror film and I can say I finally seen a good horror movie since idk why when Pet Sematary tough"
"487","@petsematarymov Just finished watching it. It’s different enough from the original to be fresh &amp; different without straying far from the source material. Creepy, atmospheric &amp; scary. #PetSematary"
"488","@KevinRBrackett Just got done seeing it. It was a great reimagining! Just different enough to be new and fresh. Quite moody and creepy ! #PetSematary"
"489","Watching #PetSematary and I’m scared as a bih!!!!!"
"490","@BadgeRising @petsematarymov It has been changed by changing the roles of characters. It’s not that hard to understand that it isn’t the same story."
"491","The world wants to know, @starryguys, how was it co-directing with a cat?"
"492","I’m going to see Pet Sematary with my nephew and I’m honestly pretty scared <U+0001F602>"
"493","This is based on The Fairly OddParents"
"494","#PetSematary is bleak and dreadful throughout as the film progresses it felt as if my skin was getting tighter. It’s full of tension until the last frame thoroughly enjoyed it &amp; LOVED the changes they made from the source material"
"495","pet sematary remake is like having a classic masterpiece... and then throwing a bucket of red paint on the bottom half"
"496","Im ready to go see Pet Sematary"
"497","Pet sematary can kiss my ass, I’m gonna have nightmares"
"498","For anyone who may have wondered why I haven't reviewed Pet Sematary or Us....you should all know that it's because I'm a straight wuss. I've lived in a couple haunted houses and horror/thrillers give me nightmares for weeks. #nope"
"499","Watching #PetSematary with the family @brandiwankenobi @ #vanmall #Cinetopia"
"500","Pet Sematary is so fucking twisted like damn. I haven’t seen a horror movie like that in a minute"
"501","I didn't see a few clips from the trailers. Is there a chance we'll see them on the Blu-ray? @starryguys @petsematarymov"
"502","Experience the movie critics are calling ""a creepy masterpiece.” Based on Stephen King's novel, see #PetSematary in theatres now. Get your tickets."

"506","@ViileViixeN @petsematarymov The ending was terrible, you're lucky you missed it."
"507","Do I pay $$ to see Claire Denis’s space sex-party thriller starring Robby Pats or do I use Moviepass and watch Pet Sematary, a movie about grieving for the death of your adolescent child and also zombie cats ??

Someone who is good at the economy please help me my family is dying"
"508","@KateySagal Sadly I will be working tomorrow, but on Sunday, I am taking my BF to go see the new #PetSematary. He just got back from a week long work trip, so it'll be a nice evening."
"509","It’s always been fascinating to me that King hates his own book for being too dark. The darkness/bleakness of the book is part of what makes it one of King’s best. It also reflects real parental fear King was struggling with the time."
"510","I would compare Pet Sematary with another of King’s best novels—Revival. Revival is more about loss of faith, but it shares that theme of a person being mentally shattered by the death of loved ones. It also has a bleaker-than-bleak ending. And it’s great!"
"511","There's no way PET SEMATARY '19 is going to be as scary as walking into my house at 1am and getting attacked by cats that want food <U+0001F63E>"
"512","Pet sematary was definitely interesting to say the least <U+0001F62F>"

#BasementRejects"
"515","Tonight's screening of Pet Sematary featured 2 cell users browsing social media, a scared out of her gord &lt;10 yo girl who really didn't want to be there, multiple talkers and a flickering bulb...but please tell me more about the vaunted cinematic experience."
"516","Pet Sematary looks like the kind of movie to watch at home with the lights on.  Don't judge me, I am not a fan of horror movies #scared #Supernatural"
"517","The best example of me being On Brand™ is how I have absolutely no intention of seeing Pet Sematary but I support That Cat in all of it's choices."
"518","Pet Sematary is a -B.  Very moody and creepy throughout, but the third act just goes off the rails and it lost me thinking about this (no spoiler): ""Wait. Through the woods. OVER a giant log jam.  Through a SWAMP. Up steps"" NOPE. NOT POSSIBLE. #PetSematary #movie"
"519","I need to see it ASAP... can’t believe all my Stephen King favs are all coming life including (Doctor Sleep) <U+0001F629><U+0001F499><U+0001F499><U+0001F499>"

"524","We know who the REAL star of this movie is"
"525","I wanna go see Pet Sematary, the Best of Enemies, and Hotel Mumbai the week.."

"528","#PetSematary what do you do when you live across the street from a real pet semetary?"
"529","I want to know about the tie wearing cat"
"530","Actually excited for some upcoming movies for the first time in a while.. Pet Sematary, Endgame, and The Joker are all looking promising."
"531","I wanted so much to love Pet Sematary. Solid performances, great cinematography, but something just seemed lacking. It was... okay. Too much given away in trailers and early interviews. Took away from  what would've been a few shocking  moments. <U+0001F431>"
"532","Watching Pet Sematary, and someone keeps moaning and screaming at every fucking thing that happens. <U+0001F644>"

"565","Pet Sematary was fine. I dont think the book lends itself to a typical feature film without shifting some things around and I kind of wish that was done more. As it stands, good adaptation, decent flick."
"566","Without spoilers #PetSematary was pretty damn great. All I'm gpb a say is if the kids from #UntilDawn had been in those woods none of this would've happened. That being said, I did appreciate the ""happy"" ending. (Reply if you want more spoilery details.)"

"583","#PetSematary is...a mixed bag of a film.   The movie does a good job with the first 2 acts and the big change from the book works as which kid dies doesn't lessen the impact of loosing someone especially a kid as parent.  But it really is after she comes back that the movie"

"650","PET SEMATARY: Better than I expected! Some missed opportunities, some odd choices (the color palette is too warm for horror), but the ads had me worried it would be THE CONJURING redux, and it's not that. It follows Mary Lambert's lead, then tries to do its own thing."

"783","So, Pet Sematary sucked shit, but the good news is the trailers for Ma and The Dead Don't Die look great."
"784","Pet Sematary (2019) was definitely better than the original. It was dark, bloody and and unsettling at moments and portrayed as what i imagine every Stephen King story to be. Slow first half, but a better, different movie second half."

"802","The Stand should be first place and The Dark Tower series shouldn't be in the top 10 but otherwise pretty, pretty good!"
"803","Stephen King's books are hard hitting, maybe because the underlying themes are so much darker than the monsters. 
Like Pet sematary, it's the underlying theme of grief and loss, and how humans cope with that, which leads to unwanted results."

"1057","Just got out of #PetSematary. On the offset it appears to be a faithful, modernized retelling but at a certain part of the movie it deviates into its own film that still keeps within the same spirit regardless of its changes. Doesn't replace the original; more a companion piece."

It was an enjoyable experience. That’s really all I could say about it lol."
"1231","@robertbeets @Petrovski1987 Honestly, Pet Sematary (the novel) is one of his few exceptions. The ending of it is legitimately powerful. I think the right director could really craft a fantastic movie out of it, and it’s just a shame it hasn’t found the right person yet."
"1232","@Jasoroyceboyd @Petrovski1987 I mean, Pet Sematary’s one of the few novels of his that managed to actually be good until the end, so it sucks this movie wasn’t able to also do that."

-The animal mask kids were there for no bigger reason

-A few of the CGI scenes could have been done better (IE Little God Swamp)

-The beginning could’ve been done a lot faster 

-The backstory with Jud’s wife manifesting via Ellie"

"1336","I am about to watch #PetSematary  with my MIL and I don’t do horror movies. I am going to need someone to hold me."
"1337","9) I can’t wait to see PET SEMATARY. 

And hope more than anything it puts to bed the whole DON’T DO REMAKES argument.

The worlds big enough for both. 
Don’t like? Don’t watch!
It really doesn’t need to devalue the original. 

Might even... you know... make you love it more."
"1338","#PetSematary is rly scary &amp; disturbing af!!! for me, it’s like a little mix of The Exorcist &amp; Hereditary. SUPER WORTH IT! <U+0001F4AF>"

"1344","@TheWriteSJSmith @matthewgleslie @petsematarymov This is my opinion as a horror fan, lover of the novel, and filmmaker. They captured a lot of King's novel that the original didn't, but it quickly went downhill. 

1. If I were to witness a travelling group of kids wearing animal mask in the woods mid-day, I'd ask questions."

"1351","Haven't seen Captain Marvel yet, haven't seen Us yet, and now Pet Sematary is out.  I'm so behind on my movies"
"1352","the new Pet Sematary feels like when someone traces a piece of art without any understanding of why the original artist composed it the way they did, resulting in a lifeless outline with none of the structure and substance that made the source material worth tracing to begin with"
"1353","I’ll die for this cat"
"1354","Guys I gotta go off about Pet Sematary in a few minutes. I'm sorry. @indie617 put a mic in front of me and I'm salty."
"1355","We had the worst theater experience ever last night seeing Pet Sematary. Made it one hour and walked out. Today, we are going back to finish what we started. Let’s hope this round goes better...  Thanks to @AlamoSpringMO for refunding our tickets! Good business. <U+0001F64F>"

It was a great adaptation- I’ve just never personally been a huge fan of Pet Sematary (which is weird because I’m a huge Stephen King fan)."
"1371","Won't watch it until I see the movie for myself, but everyone that HAS seen it already check out BBB's new review."
"1372","@OhMyMithrandir PetSematary tomorrow, MAYBE shazam tonight"
"1373","Pet Sematary was decent except that it completely fucked itself by putting key details in the trailer that were clearly intended to be presented in the film itself as surprises

What I'm saying is, if you want to see it, do not watch the trailers"
"1374","@Its_Pennywise_ @petsematarymov I saw this last night and I’m going again tomorrow. Very twisty ending. Both Churches have different creep factors but I’ll always like the original better."
"1375","@HorrorMovieCast @EvolutionPod Hmm. That sounds ominous. I was hoping with a modern feel I might be able to get back some magic of the original. Just doesn't hold up as much as I remember. Course I was 12 when I saw it. There's that. Guess I'll find out #PetSematary"
"1376","#PetSematary is actually a good time to talk quantum theory. It's simple...like Schrödenger's cat. Interpret it the way you want but the cat is both dead and alive...til ya look in the box. Or bury it in the cemetery."

"1382","87. Pet Sematary 6 out of 10.
Going from a very smart scary movie like Us to this may have made it this low of a rating unsure just wasn’t impressed"

"1384","@bookmyshow_sup Hello, Is Pet Sematary releasing in India on 5th April? And if it's not releasing on 5th, then can u please tell when it's releasing in India?"

"1386","Even my favorite newspaper back home is talking about pet Semetary but Stephen King does live in Bangor though. Been by his house several times growing up. <U+2764>"
"1387","I re-watched Labert’s take on Pet Sematary (1989) para makita kung anong mas maganda between 1989 or 2019 movie. I honestly think the original was better in most ways. ‘Yung remake parang walang emotional impact, especially after ng funeral scene."
"1388","i’m so disappointed"
"1389","The ending of #PetSematary is fucked up, but the film is so dull that it doesn't earn it."

I hope you enjoy #Us"
"1391","If you're one of those people who think the new #petsematary is chilling and atmospheric, you haven't watched enough horror movies. #fuckthismovie"
"1392","Ok so, #PetSematary remake is not getting enough credit. LOVED it. Acting felt far more grounded than the original + theme of grief played as more grim. From the score to performances from Jason Clarke to Amy Seimetz (the undeniable star here), this remake hit the right chords."
"1393","@RichieAllenShow No suprise then..... the original pet sematary is class."
"1394","Me, selda and Rebecks watched pet Sematary last night... guess what start all that mess??? A DAMN CAT."

As with It, there’s room to enjoy more than one version of a good story."

Feels good to be getting DC movies that the people are really enjoying."

"1425","idc if people hate this film this is precious as hell"
"1426","The 100-minute film moves quickly and therefore omits some extraneous details that add to the depth of the book (most noticeably, Louis' mental and physical exhaustion on the night he does the deed), but that's not to say the movie is shallow at all. #PetSematary"
"1427","#PetSematary was perfect. It stayed true to the beloved book in all the right ways, but also deviated from the original story with shocking and unexpected twists."
"1428","When the on-screen version of the actual pet cemetery aligned perfectly with the word-picture @StephenKing once painted in my own mind, it nearly drew a tear to my eye. #PetSematary"
"1429","If you know the original story, it will feel almost nostalgic and familiar, until it doesn't, and those feelings morph into confusion and terror as you enter the gut-wrenching, expertly delivered climax. GO. SEE. IT. #PetSematary"
"1430","@themediawitch they played a clip of The Wicker Man at @alamodenver last night before Pet Sematary (never seen or heard of it before) and then I see it again today in the article, so I'm picking up on cues from the universe"

"1452","So far it seems that a lot of people liked Pet Sematary a lot more than I did."

"1454","The local previewer's grapevine says #PetSematary is terrible on all dimensions that make King's writing and original PS so abjectly frightening.

"1526","Thoughts on #PetSematary 

1. Moves too quick. There's very little in the way of character development.
2. Jason Clarke is much better than (checks notes) Dale Midkiff.
3. Love the look of the woods and such. Creepy production design.
4. Yes, too many jump scares.
5. Still fun."

"1539","If the current version of #PetSematary was written up as a rewritten/expanded @StephenKing novel, it would be a very good horror book and make some nice refinements on the original (i.e. the older child saying such chilling things). But visually, the story simply DOES NOT WORK."
"1540","@FreddyInSpace I can count on half of one hand what worked in this remake of ""Pet Sematary""--and could write up a shopping list of my own about what didn't, which is damned near everything from the DUMB-waiter addition to the ""old man meets little girl in the woods in a creepy cemetery"" intro."

"1764","Found #PetSematary mildly disappointing. Fairly atmospheric and some decent jumpscares, but the trailer had (and spoiled) some of the best moments."
"1765","The trailer also made me assume we'd get more about the history of the Pet Sematary, with the processions, etc. Instead, it just moved on."
"1766","It was a solid movie!
It’s doesn’t explain very much and I think many information from the book are missing.

"1772","The ending of the new PET SEMATARY is silly."
"1773","There's some awkward editing in the new Pet Sematary, much of it born of footage that just wasn't shot in a way to match well. Seems like there's an unnecessary level of clunk here and there. What a shame. What's good is good, however, and there are a few brilliant choices."

"1782","#PetSematary tonight. I'm so glad I stayed away from all trailers following the first one that got me hooked. Seeing how many people on Twitter have been spoiled was a good enough warning sign. I haven't seen the previous movie or read the book so I'm quite intrigued seeing this."

"1790","@TheDaveCave_ Skip both and watch the original Pet Sematary. Lol

I enjoyed Shazam way more than the new Pet Sematary but if you've never seen the original you likely wont have many issues with the remake."
"1791","#PetSematary would have been MUCH better if they explained things and stuck to the original story line. Way too many people that never read the book seem to be giving reviews... 7/10"

"1797","me right now after seeing pet sematary because i was disappointed <U+0001F644><U+0001F644><U+0001F644>"
"1798","The early reviews for Pet Sematary were near raves but as more reviews came in that Rotten Tomatoes score plummeted. Over the top reviews from genre festivals should always be looked at with suspicion."
"1799","I was just ok with #PetSematary — until the third act. That’s what the film was really needing and it won me over. Wasn’t huge on the jump scares and it’s adherence. But I dug the more overt supernatural tone and it’s handling of themes. Walked away in preference to it."

"1810","im tryna convince my dad to watch pet sematary together"

"1816","Saw pet sematary and it sucked ass"
"1817","@jennferatu @petsematarymov @HorrorVirgin Maybe the source material better as a book rather than a movie. it was wayy better than the old movie, but still felt very generic with it's scares. I watched it day before yesterday and I've already forgotten most of it. Maybe after your blog I'll get a different perspective."

"1834","Pet Sematary <U+0001F37F><U+0001F37F><U+0001F37F> Rare movie you want to be longer. Feels like they sliced the meat and some could have been cool subplots out of it. Very thin on suspense and the end just feels clumsily wrapped up. Cast, design, score was great tho"
"1835","Just watched PET SEMATARY. Take a movie like THE BABADOOK or HEREDITARY and replace the psychological exploration of loss and grief with mostly jump scares and this is the movie you get. It's not a bad watch, though. I enjoyed it. Holds a torch to King's novel and the first film."
"1836","Big shout-out to my local theater for listing a start time of PET SEMATARY for 12:15 and the movie not starting until 12:45 after a string of commercials and trailers longer than a CVS receipt. Par for the course, @RegalMovies. Par for the course."
"1837","Other PET SEMATARY ruminations: no heads. No talkers or texters. Good experience, but anyone that takes fleece throws and wears their pajamas in the box office to treat theater seats like their living room couch is trash. Absolute uncultured swine."

"2281","Just saw Pet Sematary. Going in with no knowledge of the source material made for a really fun watch. The few actors that had main parts were all really solid. Did a great job building tension to a fantastically creepy breaking point in the third act."

"2283","Good call I didn’t watch the trailer for this year’s pet sematary because it pretty much showed everything that happened in the movie"
"2284","My wife and I went to the movies tonight and we saw two of her students from school. She asked what they were seeing and they turn around and their Dad reluctantly says “Pet Sematary.” These two little girls are in third grade and kindergarten. Good luck to those brave children!"

"2296","@petsematarymov and probably doesnt help that this movie has been ""remade"" like 8 times"
"2297","Pet sematary was soooo good!! Honestly was not expecting to like it so much but i highly recommend, starts off creepy then gets scary and really good ending"
"2298","happy Saturday!  I just watched Pet Sematary and now I’m afraid my hamster is gonna murder me in my sleep tonight! :)"
"2299","Saw the new film based on @StephenKing’s book #PetSematary. I was terrified. My kid handled it better than I did, and that’s because she’s got more chill. Moral of the story—if you see creepy kids wearing masks  fucking move. Also, never move to the country."

"2306","Tonight we went to check out @petsematarymov at @ShopCrossCounty multiplex. What a terrible experience! 2 dudes almost had a full on fight just as movie started. A lady came in with a week old baby and sat right next to us. The people who manage this place did nothing!"

The Pet Sematary remake deserves its 6/10 rating. Let’s just say...Dead is better."
"2312","@WorkoutNirvana Yes, although the reviews I’d read say it’s really bad. I also saw Pet Sematary. It was better than the original, but I wouldn’t rush to see it."

"2315","Hello I’m back from watching pet sematary and it was actually so good I’m in shock"
"2316","the ending of pet sematary was trash af"
"2317","Did a horror double feature tonight. Pet Sematary and Us. Both are good but PS was definitely better."
"2318","If didn’t ruin the plot lol. It’s a remake."
"2319","Just white people being dumb"
"2320","btw the new pet sematary was literally awful. going into it my expectations were low and somehow the movie was worse than that eye"
"2321","Unretweeted that writer who reviewed the new Pet Sematary. They said that people who want to bring back their deceased loved ones are monsters. 

Fucking crazy bitch."

"2324","Wait, it’s out already?"
"2325","@petsematarymov the last half hour was so rushed. also the trailer really showed wayyyy too much."
"2326","@petsematarymov did not meet the hype surrounding it. It certainty wasn’t “One of the best Stephen King movies”. Disappointing."
"2327","The best part of Pet Sematary is Church being a badass."
"2328","it was with my 8th grade crush, and we watched pet sematary <U+0001F60E>"
"2329","@starryguys seen Pet Sematary twice today, u guys knocked it out of the park! Up there w the best King adaptations for sure and the ending was brilliant and bone chilling. I loved every minute of it <U+0001F918>"
"2330","Seen @petsematarymov twice in one day! Imo it's up there w the best Stephen King adaptations. I loved it, the ending is haunting and incredible. Great film <U+0001F918>"
"2331","Spoiler Alert for #PetSematary .

The whole movie is as shitty as the #Ramones cover at the end."
"2332","So you’re thinking of seeing the new Pet Sematary movie...

Do not. 

Things you can do instead: 
1. Read the book. 
2. Watch the 1989 movie. 
3. Watch the sequel which had nothing to do with the book and wasn’t that great except for Eddie Furlong."
"2333","@petsematarymov Ugh.  Hollywood hasn't had anything original for 2 decades.  Remakes!  Boring.  No thanks.  I used to like King, but then he decided to put down his pen and open his mouth.  Yuck."
"2334","#PetSematary was so good I'm still shook to my core. 
The ending of the was so unsettling for me. It was one of the most messed up things I’ve seen in a while. GO SEE IT.

"2337","The best part of Pet Sematary was the fact that they put Pet Sematary by the Ramones at the end, Fucking Boss Move"
"2338","I've never seen anything like it, an adaptation of a book that both makes substantial changes and rewards loyal fans of the book and earlier movie. It plays with the fact that you know the story and uses that to twist the knife. #PetSematary"
"2339","I’m really trying to go see Pet Sematary"
"2340","Saw #PetSematary tonight and I must, great job on this adaptation!  Took it to a whole new level!! Love @StephenKing"
"2341","I think my biggest problem with #PetSematary was that it didn’t actually try to make anyone care about the relationships between the characters. Also, the ending was shit"
"2342","for the record the 1989 pet sematary movie isn’t great. it’s just fine. it’s the book I’m passionate about."
"2343","the biggest difference would be that it’s Not Good"
"2344","I wanna go watch Pet Sematary... but the original scares me still... and I don’t wanna have nightmares <U+0001F643>"
"2345","On the one hand I hope this prequel doesn’t happen and on the other I hope the series didn’t end with that God awful “Good Day to Die Hard”."

"2347","If you like horror movies don’t go see Pet Sematary holy hell was it bad. It had so much potential and I’m so disappointed &gt;:c"

"2356","The new Pet Sematary was underwhelming. It was decent, but just not a great reboot, and the ending was garrrrbaaage."
"2357","@PNemiroff If you notice the Dewey would be like buried in Pet Sematary but not Gordo basic in of there."
"2358","I would give #PetSematary a 10/10"

"2362","saw pet sematary. that cat acts just like mine"
"2363","Soooo saw #PetSematary last night &amp; <U+0001F44D>. The 80's original was so <U+0001F525> I thought they were gonna screw it up like they do most remakes but 95% of it was true to the original. They just put a tiny twist in there with the older daughter dying instead of the boy, etc., so I can dig it."
"2364","I think Mr. King should refund our coins for that sassy cat in Pet Sematary<U+0001F602>"
"2365","@VioTCZ Why did you bury me pass the #PetSematary Vio - that cat"
"2366","fun fact: 4 different cats played Church, the cat"
"2367","@ErnLeNern Too many to name! I went and saw pet sematary tonight, pretty solid!"
"2368","I watched the original Pet Sematary on Netflix. Should I still watch the new one?"
"2369","Revisiting @TheMaryLambert’s Pet Sematary Two, a movie which, while not as solid as the first, is still a brutal horror film that provokes and disturbs. Clancy Brown is great. I actually dig it."
"2370","Regardless of how you feel about the new @petsematarymov, there is no denying that Jeté Laurence is a force of nature. She gives a performance most actors three times her age couldn't sell. Go see it for that alone. She's absolutely chilling."
"2371","I gotta admit.. the original @petsematarymov was better <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"2372","@briarhaint I, for one, don't want to be buried in a pet sematary. I don't want to live my life again."
"2373","Two new movies this week close with a RAMONES related track over the credits. One of them is great, the other is PET SEMATARY"
"2374","The scariest part of Pet Sematary was when the man in front of us had a giant sneeze"
"2375","Pet Sematary (2019) was just another cliched scary little girl movie with little redeeming qualities. Don’t waste your time."
"2376","With Pet Sematary being released, what is your favorite horror movie remake? @PromoteHorror @12nighthorror @HallowsHaunts @sluts_guts @kinky_horror @AlexVorkov @StrangeCinema65 @TWeirdling @TrashCanDanpt3 @CaledonianRoses @MoxyTools @QueenHalloweenW @TV_Fanatic_Girl #PetSematary"

"2378","I want a pet sematary gecko, just think about what characteristics an inherently bloodthirsty demon gecko would have its amazing"
"2379","Another thought, are the earthworms within the magic demon dirt of the pet sematary constantly big mad but unable to like do shit cause theyre just worms?"
"2380","Walked out of pet sematary"
"2381","Me and bre walke four of pet sematary <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> it was hella slow not even scary iono"
"2382","i laughed through most of the new pet sematary movie because all i could think about was an rv camper coming through the woods"
"2383","Is it really not good <U+0001F644> @Riahisabel"
"2384","The new pet sematary was fine but it’s pretty much like, going through the motions of the original until they decide to change things up and turn it into a James Wan-ish Conjuring spin-off type flick with no heart whatsoever."
"2385","i never wanted to see louis creed suffer ever again i'm pressing charges"
"2386","i never want to see louis creed sad or suffering ever again i'm pressing charges"
"2387","Pet Sematary was so fucking GOOD. They did not fuck around. But maybe I only liked it because I’m high idk"
"2388","I’m usually really good with scary movies, but for some weird reason Pet Sematary really got to me.

I could just be acting like a baby though <U+0001F602>"
"2389","If you haven’t read #PetSematary then I could see how you’d give it glowing reviews. But for me it missed the mark and glossed over/excluded key characters, scenes, and themes. By itself though? Not a bad film &amp; the performances &amp; atmosphere were excellent"
"2390","But the #PetSematary movie is to the book what revived pets are to their initial selves. It’s Pet Sematary-ish. Has traces of the themes &amp; storyline but is obviously &amp; unsettlingly different to what it once was."
"2391","Pet Sematary (2019) was solid. Definitely better than I expected, 2.5/5"
"2392","pet sematary: i seen a lot of mixed reviews about this movie and i can say i honestly really enjoyed it. it was a cookie cutter horror film but i personality enjoy a good jump scare. it had the perfect amount of gore for me and i thought it was well done. only complaint is..(c)"
"2393","Ugh, I sucked my agents dick for THIS?! 

- the actors in Hereditary and the new Pet Sematary when they read the scripts, probably"
"2394","ALTHOUGH Pet Sematary does have the advantage with the HILARIOUS fight bw Ellie and her dad, where this grown ass man is on all fours and his tiny 9yo child somehow has enough force and power to gangster kick his lights out."
"2395","The cat is definitely cute as fuck tho, even after becoming Undead Murder Kitty™<U+FE0F> so... 2nd advantage Pet Sematary. I’d watch it again if I was properly unsober whereas Hereditary already took 45 min of my life before I walked out and ILL BE FUCKING DAMNED IF I GIVE IT ANY MORE"
"2396","#PetSematary was sooooo scary omg lmao. I kept jumping so hard in my chair and emitting inaudible sounds and everyone kept laughing <U+0001F62D>

Sure there was some illogical moments (it’s a horror movie) and it clearly doesn’t have the geniosity of #Us, but it was a fricken DOPE remake"
"2397","I just saw this and wow"
"2398","I’m not too fond of the 2019 #PetSematary. Too much changes from the novel and 1989 film."
"2399","Not shown in #PuertoRico <U+0001F1F5><U+0001F1F7> (only in 1 theater far away) thanks @ParamountPics &amp; @CaribbeanCinems <U+0001F624><U+0001F624>"
"2400","Lessons learned from Pet Sematary

1. LISTEN TO YOUR FAMILY
2. If you’re having trippy dreams consistently, LISTEN TO THEM
3. When you see creepy shit, GTFO!

Loved it"
"2401","Watching the original Pet Sematary and I'm amazed by not only how it stands up, but also how it's so much better than the remake. It actually gives more breathing time between important events. It's more willing to spend time with the family and their emotions/conversations."
"2402","Who brings children to see Pet Sematary? AND talk and make out the whole time while force feeding the popcorn to the kids so the ""adults"" can make out."

"2440","@petsematarymov I liked it but it was just barely Pet Semetary. Hopefully if someone ever bothers to do it again they’ll tell the actual story. Stephen King is a literal master of horror and literature. Why in the name of fuck does everyone think it’s a good idea to change everything he writes?"
"2441","#PetSematary Landed few major change towards Stephen King’s original version including lesser characters but deeper complexities. Kolsch &amp; Widmyer crafted several unnerving moments to unsettling their audience. Clarke and company defined fear of death perfectly! 3.5/5"

"2787","#PetSematary - A remake that keeps the creepiness of the original, while making some fantastic updates.  Gory and twisted with a demented cat you won’t soon forget. Loses steam towards the end, I wanted the movie to take some more risks, but worth the watch.  3.5/5 stars"

"2805","#PetSematary was a complete let down. definitely prefer the original"
"2806","#PetSematary was an interesting film. Quite a few unnecessary changes but some of the visuals were as described by the novel. I liked it. Not as much as the 1989 version. The trailer ruined the film."

"2822","The new #PetSematary is sooo creepy!! Very true to the spirit of the book, and the acting is phenomenal. Definitely a worthy remake"
"2823","#PetSematary was the first horror movie to scare me. I appreciate what they tried with the remake but there’s nothing quite as terrifying as the original"
"2824","As I dance ever closer to the mortal coil, what really struck me with the new #PetSematary is the inevitable march of death; but in a rather comforting sense. Acceptance is key: if Louis had left well enough alone, the Creed’s could still be having a swell life. Acceptance."
"2825","Just watched #PetSematary not sure if I loved it or hated it in all honesty"
"2826","Going to see #PetSematary today. Keeping my hopes low. Read, and fell in love with the book at 12, loved the movie in ‘90 and specifically Fred Gwynn as Jud. Hoping for the best, but we’ll see. I’m a King purist. I DO like the new Church- looks like book Church.  #StephenKing"
"2827","I feel like a lot of the criticisms I’m seeing of #PetSematary could just as easily be thrown at the original. I love Mary Lambert’s adaptation, but other than Fred Gwynne and zombie Gage, I can’t think of a single thing the original does better than the remake."

"2843","So #PetSematary was okay. I couple of times I'll admit to burying my head into @elle__kay__ arm<U+0001F602> but overall not great. A solid 6/10."
"2844","@KindaFunnyKevin @petsematarymov It was just ok in my book. Nothing groundbreaking or exciting. Slightly better than the original, but I never really cared for the original film."
"2845","@chris22zombie @petsematarymov Yes, but I hope more view from the possessed family. The prequel is a good idea for Timmy Baterman history and Norma. A full Wendigo movie is also a good idea too."
"2846","#PetSematary was decent. I didn’t love it as I hoped to. Despite some cool settings &amp; special FX work, the movie lacked the emotional elements I wanted to see portrayed by the characters &amp; the new twists didn’t deliver anything mind blowing to me. Rating: 6.5/10"

WILDLY different from the book in terms of everything but the basic plot skeleton of the Pet Semetary. I don't think that's necessarily bad for a second movie adaption. Could have benefited from more nuanced storytelling. The cat was creepy."

"2972","@acevonjohnson @petsematarymov Look AVJ, I admire Stephen King and appreciate his takes on Twitter about life, music (RhinoBucket fan!), and especially politics...

And NO doubting his cred in writing ALL genres, but if the movie DOESN'T have the Ramones song, I ain't interested?!?!

And them's the facts...<U+0001F643>"
"2973","#PetSematary is solid, tho OG is bettah. Definitely worth a matinee"
"2974","@petsematarymov this is was the most disturbing and scariest horror film I have ever seen. I’ve seen a lot. This truly is what horror is all about. Fantastic cast and film. I cannot praise it more. #traumatized"

"2977","#PetSematary wasn't too bad. Great cast with solid acting &amp; shot really well. Don't get why you'd think it was ok to bring your daughter back to life if the cat was a psycho when you tried it with him. Jete Laurence was brilliant and so was John Lithgow"

#PetSematary is OUT <U+0001F44E> and #Shazam is IN. <U+0001F44D>

"3043","Absolutely dug #PetSematary !

Without going into spoiler territory I'll say that it does what any good adaptation should - take what works and tries to improve upon it so that audiences aren't just watching a rehash of what came before."

It could've been WAY interesting than that."

"3055","Honestly I’m worried about the baby #PetSematary"
"3056","I read the book a few times, listened to the audiobook, watched the original movie a few times, and saw the documentary about the movie. Not to mention the Ramones tune on a loop in my head this whole week.

"3062","One Man Cinema Club: #PetSematary An efficient &amp; creepy adaption of Stepehn King's novel about raising the dead via ritual burial in cursed ground. Solid performances but a little thin character wise. Enjoyable set up for the grim but brief final act. 7/10"

Heard good, really good, and quite bad so we shall see.
Hope it honours the original, and the book.
Except of course that one plot change we all know about already"

"3080","I have SO MANY #PetSematary  thoughts but I can’t share any more without getting really frustrated so... *screams internally*"

"3143","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov I watched the movies before I read the books, but that made me realize how unfinished the movies really were but I was still satisfied because of the years that the movies were made. I use that as the excuse for not executing them to their fullest"
"3144","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov I think they could have spent more time on the relationship between Jud and Louis, or even the scene between Ellie and Jud (about Norma). But I still don’t think there was really enough Zelda. Again, it’s hard to depict a King Novel into a 2 hour film so it’s pick and choose."
"3145","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov It’s honestly really easy to understand from the movie. If you couldn’t grasp that Zelda is the reason why Rachel is afraid of death, and that it will always come back and haunt her, then oh well."
"3146","@n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov I am saying that you will get a much better understanding about Rachel’s feelings towards death, and the death of Zelda, if you read the book. A 15 hour book is hard to depict in a 2 hour movie."
"3147","@n1khilarora @nerd_named_josh @Cavington @petsematarymov They have 3 different endings. I wouldn’t go with this one as trash, but definitley not the one I would have preferred (I think)"
"3148","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Ehh disagree with the Shining being fully summed even though I did like the movie. The mini series would have been good if they had gotten a better Danny Torrance"
"3149","@n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov It’s difficult to 15 hour books into a 2 hour movie. Let alone a Stephen King book. I am saying that you would get a better, more in depth, understanding of why Zelda is important to the story if you read the book."
"3150","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Well it was important, but I suppose we just see different aspects of the book important to be incorporated into the film."
"3151","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov I feel that Pet Sematary and the Shining are very mental novels, a lot of happens in their thoughts so it is hard to get it onto film. At least with the shining half the time you didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t"
"3152","@nerd_named_josh @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov The death of Zelda shows why Rachel was afraid of death. Why she hated the Pet Sematary, and why she (in the case of the movie) didn’t want Ellie to know that Church died. The scenes with Zelda showed why Rachel acted the way she did about death. And that was putting it simply."
"3153","@MrGallionverse Thats my thought regarding ANY kind of adaption. I loved how #PetSematary did it's own thing."
"3154","K. I’m definitely going to need Sunday funday to happen after I get out of this movie. #PetSematary"

"3156","@crewel01 @FrightFest @petsematarymov @starryguys @ParamountUK @ParamountPics @paulmcevoy @ianfrightfest @alanfrightfest @CloutComCoUk @c1aredean Not scary. Zero atmosphere.

"3195","so did they move to this house without furniture? wats in the car 
oh movers came already 
and no one heard that truck comin? #PetSematary"
"3196","how convenient exposition guy was here to scare her #PetSematary"
"3197","nevermind i take it back, black zombie does a jump scare with the ground being sour but i was nodding off so maybe its to wake me up #PetSematary"
"3198","this movie already boring tf outta me, its not even creepy but least it's light on the jump scares for the most part #PetSematary"
"3199","seriously this movie is boring af except for when the dad has the shining to see black zombie #PetSematary"
"3200","yeah maybe not have creepy old guy go out on halloween plus they live by a damn truck route
its broad daylight so what houses are they going to? and why arent they ever in school or day care #PetSematary"
"3201","yeah zelda dying was MUCH creepier in this one than the original
it still conflates the plot
but its so ptsd inducing wow why you never talk about this before? #PetSematary"
"3202","1. mom not mad the daughter ran off
2. isn't scared some giant creepy old guy is alone in the woods with her daughter
3. is totally chill about the whole thing
also why tf is old dude even out here? for exposition ah of course
#PetSematary"
"3203","i will thank this movie for not having the jump scare, its spooky when black zombie shows up but doesn't have that music sting
cat jumping earlier is just foreshadowing #PetSematary"
"3204","Headwound harry is more believable and intense #PetSematary 
buuuuut black guy dies first in the horror movie cliche
seriously, in 2019 you kill the black guy first???"
"3205","feels liek this movie will h elp explain a lot of the devices king is gonna use in The Shining 2: Doctor sleep #PetSematary"
"3206","wow old neighbor guy is really a cunt
#PetSematary"
"3207","ok now this little girl is going over to the creepy neighbor guys home; where is her mother and why is she just so naive and friendly??
doesnt she have school? college is in session #PetSematary"
"3208","cat watchin them screw while eating a semi dead bird 
does that mean u turn into a zombie when it bites yo #PetSematary"
"3209","the fact he's hallucinating without being on anything should worry everyone #PetSematary"
"3210","so i woulda suspected the old guy killed the car idc how many trucks there are 
also whole movie could be avoided if he just talked to her about things dying
and again lithgow puts MAJOR pedo vibes by tellin the daughter she already put a spell on him
#PetSematary"
"3211","so gage isnt a toddler in this? #PetSematary"
"3212","ready for the storm...of the century? #PetSematary"
"3213","the creepy kid funeral would bother me a lot
also reminds me of something from EC comics #PetSematary"
"3214","psycho cat goin after that toddler, whos old enough to not be in a damn crib anymore btw
now he's tellin the story of his evil pet; like WHY DID U DO IT THEN BRUH #PetSematary"
"3215","creepy john lithgow gives me serious pedo vibes; maybe it's the trucker hat #PetSematary"
"3216","so cus lithgow has such a boner for the little girl he's the one to tell john connor to bury the cat in the pet cemetary? #PetSematary"
"3217","so why again are they so super friendly with the creepy old hoarder guy when they first met him alone in the woods with their daughter? #PetSematary"
"3218","this B plot with the mom's ptsd haunting is annoying; i mean it's creepy and would be better if they were both related to the plot like a generic haunted house. I think they should've just done their own thing dont adapt this #PetSematary"
"3219","though i liked the slow build up to the dumb waiter jump scare from the medicine cabinet #PetSematary"
"3220","Follow tthis beautiful cat @Church_aka_leo! If you watched #PetSematary, you will know he did an amazing job as Church! :)"

"3225","My aim in life is to be half as self-assured as Church in #PetSematary"
"3226","@petsematarymov was fantastic. @StephenKing should be proud."

"3228","@StephenKing :-( why didnt they just stick to the original story from the beginning #PETSEMATARY  it was a very short film The Original was way better btw I do admire all of  your work but I'm just on the cross lines on this movie *SadFace*"
"3229","@petsematarymov Garbage, another movie that is pushing liberal agenda by casting a girl in a boys roll. #Ghostbusterssucks"
"3230","People histerically crying in the aisles, others fleeing the theatre in fear . . . . . . .

"3235","All I can think of is how much did the cat potentially suffer during making of  #PetSematary  ?

@petsematarymov please tell me: not at all. Is it not at all?"
"3236","Review time! #PetSematary what a film! Was a little slow at the start, but picked up after the girl died. From then on its horror all the way through, and the actors are great. The main male actor was pretty eh at the start, but he goes Jack Nickleson to bring his daughter back."
"3237","@MidCenturyMike @petsematarymov Yes I recall. This one is better. Takes some liberties though. Scary!"
"3238","I could not agree more. #PetSematary"
"3239","@RottenTomatoes Good for #Shazam , I was entertained from start to finish.
Also a decent opening for #PetSematary , looking forward to see it.
Always happy when movies do good at the box office."
"3240","@petsematarymov Cause the first one didn't suck enough you had to try again?"

"3244","its flat out trash."
"3245","@petsematarymov It was wonderful!  Faithful, inspiring, and terrifying!"
"3246","I love Stephen King but #PetSematary was so silly, nothing like the unsettling grief of the book, and it gave away pretty much everything in the trailer. I was laughing through the second half."
"3247","Saw #PetSematary , Leo ( Church ) was the best actor!

Jokes aside, it was pretty good. I liked the changes, though it didn't blow me away. Going to be listening to that soundtrack though."

"3252","i wasn't scared WHEN watching #PetSematary but after i got home and continued to think about it, the themes of death, it started to freak me the hell out and genuinely frighten me, and i don't get scared of stuff like that often.

and that, is a sign of excellent film making."

That didn’t bother me as much but it’s definitely much different.

John Lithgow was great. Jason Clarke, always great. They were awesome."
"3321","@abigailsonger @Cinemark @petsematarymov @StephenKing I loved it too. I think it’s probably the best adaptation of a King book (or one of lol). 

Part II is gonna be dope. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader?! Fuck yeah! And the first movie had damn good acting from those kids; they were really good."
"3322","@AmberGabrio @Cinemark @petsematarymov @StephenKing Go to Cinemark =P"
"3323","@abigailsonger @Cinemark @petsematarymov @StephenKing Lmaooo, I was just about to tag you too <U+0001F61B>

"3334","#PetSematary what a way to fuckup a classic.  The movie was brilliant up to the accident..  disappointing @StephenKing sorry what they did with your book."
"3335","#PetSematary is good!! Very similar to the original, with enough differences to keep you entertained...the sister still creeps me out <U+0001F630>"
"3336","Sometimes remade is better.

And it most certainly is here. Mostly.

#PetSematary is an enjoyable time thanks to its gorgeous production, terrific acting, tense atmosphere, and brilliantly twisted ending."
"3337","@HarrisonSmith85 In muy humble opinion #PetSematary the atmospheric is more scary that the original. But here, is the same and same again. Jump-scares, sound cracking you heard. I love it John Lithgow as Jud Crandall, and the little girl playing Ellie Creed so terrific. Not that bad."
"3338","#PetSematary hits $43M at the #BoxOffice worldwide. The cats in horror films so very interesting."
"3339","#PetSematary was not good. I expected more and got less"
"3340","Yeah I’m watching the avengers now. But like #Shazam was very good! I’d probably watch it again."
"3341","So the new #PetSematary just didn't work for me <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> I don't know if it was because the original was so amazing, but the remake felt bland in comparison. Although Church and Ellie were definitely creepy."
"3342","The first hour of #PetSematary was good, and then it sort of went off the rails and got dumb. Church is still a good cat throughout though."
"3343","That moment where you see a highly publicized movie...just to be incredibly disappointed by it. Yeah, that's how I feel about the latest #PetSematary .. As always Hollyweird, leave the classics alone!"
"3344","#Shazam was even better than I expected! Real heart, love, and wacky nerdiness I never saw coming, even in the golden age of superhero movie weirdness! Takes a moment to get going, but after the unrelenting tension of #PetSematary I'm very satisfied with my night"
"3345","Just got out of #PetSematary and holy fuck that was unsettling. Shocking moments of gore, well placed and well executed jump scares, and an emotional attachment to the v. well cast family made it that much worse when everything went down.

...I think I'm gonna go see #Shazam now."
"3346","#PetSematary was pretty good! I think the original is still my fave, but I loved the changes in this.

I really liked the changes. I like that the creators were really bold in where they deviated! 

Both are great horror, both have different feels, and that’s good :3"
"3347","Imma have to watch the new #GameOfThrones until tomorrow, cuz I’m going to go see #PetSematary tonight! So please, no spoilers."
"3348","#PetSematary is racist and homophobic. No i will not explain why because if you have to ask you are homophobic and racist anyways."

"3351","Bout to go check out this @petsematarymov"
"3352","@JohnLithgow was superb in #PetSematary, its honestly a great movie with a fantastic cast!"
"3353","#PetSematary is one of the most unsettling movies I’ve watched in a while...wow"
"3354","#PetSematary was fairly faithful to the novel...until the last 20 minutes or so. I'm conflicted."
"3355","#PetSematary - Soulless film! All buildup &amp; no action. Decent performances, Less scares &amp; Terrible ending. The secondary sister story was totally irrelevant. Film has left a lot of things unanswered. Original 1989 film was so much better. Another bad remake. Underwhelming!"
"3356","@BlastloXD @RegalMovies @Dumbo @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @UsMovie Yeah... cause that what I do lol

Over all today cost me a crap ton of cash but It was nice to hang with family and it was nice to see the girls not stress over stuff!"
"3357","So the Family and I just got back from watching 4 Movies... BIG THANKS to @RegalMovies... The Girls and I seen @Dumbo and @ShazamMovie, which they highly enjoyed!
After that the girls went home, my Bro-inlaw and I got to watch @petsematarymov and @UsMovie!!

"3366","Went and watched the new #PetSematary .  It's good.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Huge deviation from the original movie which is also good.  Worth watching for sure. I think the original movie ""gets"" the book better but that's okay because this was something different."
"3367","Watched @petsematarymov oh man. Scary as F. Sleeping with all lights on"
"3368","I don’t watch enough horror so even though there’s a lot of cliches I was still scared throughout. Also (possibly?) commentary on how parents will fuck up their kids because of their own baggage no matter how well meaning their intentions are.#PetSematary"

"3373","Just finished my written review of the #PetSematary remake. Should hopefully be able to film the video review tomorrow and, with any luck, publish Tuesday morning."
"3374","Today, I had planned on seeing @PetSemataryMov, but due to significant delays on my end, I couldn’t make it on time. Instead, I saw @ShazamMovie. My expectations were at zero. The trailers made the movie looked boring, cheesy, and childish. However..."

"3400","At an hour 41 #PetSematary is really short for a Stephen King adaptation. After watching it I’m convinced that’s just because large portions of the film are flat out missing."

"3417","I really enjoyed #PetSemetary .  The changes made for more entertaining movie. 
The acting in it was jaw-dropping.   You have probably never seen a better cast in a horror movie.  #amyseimetz should be a household name, and John Lithgow shows us why he is one.

"3431","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov In the book it was very crucial but they trivilized it in the movie and still spent a bunch of time on it. Its supposed to be a major part of developing her character but they implent it as filler. Even the original pet sem made it important"
"3432","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov I understand that but the movie does a poor job of portraying that connection and the scenes involving it have little effect on the story, you could take it all out and replace it with a brief exposition and the movie would be unaffected save for runtime"
"3433","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Honestly yea a show of ones like pet sem, children of the corn, and even IT would be AMAZING. Kujo, Maximum Overdrive, and The Shining are probably the only movies that fully summed up the story, overdrive mostly cause it was a short story instead of a novel."
"3434","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov I grasped the idea its just the movie wasted a bunch of time on the idea when it wasnt important at all and in all that time barely even made it seem like it was as major of a reason as it is."
"3435","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Fair enough, and by a bunch of time i more mean in comparison to its affect on the film it had significant screen time, especially when some more important parts seemed to have lost screentime to scenes like those. Agree to disagree though ig"
"3436","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Yes but if you cant find a way to have it relate to the story of the movie at all either cut it or simplify it. Its not like they kept it true to book anyway."
"3437","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Yea i was gonna say maybe the shining but ran out of space, compared to some of the other films it covered a lot of the material but yea more couldve been done with a mini series"
"3438","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov Fair enough, guess it depends on the way youre looking at them"
"3439","@CarlyJC_ @n1khilarora @Cavington @petsematarymov True theres a lot of aspects that require a deeper thinking. I think i might associate it with being more finished than pet sem because i saw the shining before i read it but it was the other way around with pet sem so the shining movie winds up feeling a little more finished"

"3493","@SirYukonGold @petsematarymov I’m contemplating on seeing it, I’ve heard good things and bad things lol"
"3494","Only The Thing, And The Fly Are Two Of Very, Very Great Remakes!"
"3495","@JaeAparicio @petsematarymov trust me , you’re ready <U+0001F611>"
"3496","Pet Sematary was surprisingly pretty good!! I think I like it a bit more then the original. Decent effects, soundtrack and acting. The changes/differences felt great. I recommend going to check it out if you're looking for a horror movie to go see :) #PetSematary"
"3497","This is so cool! <U+0001F63C> @HackorSlashLex @Rojawesome"
"3498","Am curious about  #PetSematary but I doubt it will match the book. Couldn't sleep for a few nights after finishing it. (Of course, was a teen then, so maybe an overreaction <U+0001F601>) It was one of the most checked-out books at our lending library. Yes, such things actually existed <U+0001F601>"
"3499","Massive congrats to @ponysmasher on #Shazam’s debut.
Such a fun film &amp; deserves attention.
My kid spent yesterday afternoon jumping around yelling “SHAZAM!” &amp; singing “lightning from my hands!”
Isn’t that what films are all about?

Oh, she’s a horror kid. And loved your monsters."
"3500","Same goes to @starryguys.
I went in pre-angry at #PetSematary (yes, I’m one of those, sorry) and came out delighted.
Round two this week. I can’t wait to see it again."
"3501","Have to see this!!!"
"3502","Went to #PetSematary today ...
Our thoughts on the new film hit Tuesday"
"3503","@SoundFi360 @PetSematary @wonderparkmovie I saw a Pet Sematary 8:40 show last night thanks to you and .@wwwbigbaldhead recommendation... which happened on a day off when I had enough money for gas to drive 100 miles and back... plus some for food."
"3504","#Shazam was great and highly recommend it, meanwhile #PetSematary was absolutely forgettable and doesn't hold a candle to the original in my opinion."
"3505","fucking love this movie, scarier than the second imo."
"3506","@petsematarymov best scary movie ever."
"3507","@petsematarymov They literally re made this. Its 95% the exact same as the previous movie. Wasn't bad at all but I could have just watched the old one, same experience."
"3508","Just finished #PetSematary and deadass when we drove down my street there was a cat on the road. Once we walked up the driveway the same cat ran across us and under the car"
"3509","Who down to go see this with me?"
"3510","theaters that sell alcohol are the goat... #PetSematary was good... i yelled a few times and they gave NO FUCKS in that movie lmfaoooo <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FD>"
"3511","Sir Walter Scott and James Hogg deftly wove Scottish folklore with the tropes of the popular Gothic novel, so there’s definitely a case to be made."
"3512","RT zachraffio: The cat in #PetSematary worked just as hard as anyone else on that set. 

She deserves to go to the premiere, wear a little…"
"3513","RT bookversusmovie: How well did the #PetSematary remake stay close to the book? We talk with Deana Twisted_Philly and discuss how much w…"
"3514","missed #PetSematary ugh"
"3515","@petsematarymov This is the first time I watch #PetSematary  and I think it does a frikkkin good job as a horror movie. My sisters and I are still recovering from trauma."
"3516","Pet Sematary movie makes me stressed out and exhausted. It's horror @petsematarymov #HorrorMovies #horror"
"3517","@linoleumcast @ShazamMovie @petsematarymov @AmazingGraceMov @HighLifeMovie @KinoLorber From just looking at the poster the Aretha movie looks life changing. With that said here are my favourite concert movies in no order. Dont judge:
Stop Making Sense
Meeting people is Easy
Shut up and play the Hits
Song Remains the Same
Rattle and Hum and
TheLastWaltz
Yours?"
"3518","@toptal he is a number 1 basher of @mainedcm 
With the other account @don_suratos"
"3519","I literally hatee scary movies but they look so interesting I still go see them anyway <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"3520","I’m gonna say it, if the parents would’ve done their jobs as parents and watched their kids (especially the little one) considering that they’re in a huge unsafe wooded area none of the things they went through would’ve happened. #PetSematary"
"3521","The best part of #PetSematary was Church <U+0001F63C>"
"3522","@Cavington @petsematarymov I completely agree. I get that it had to do with accepting death but other than that, it would completely spin the movie around to the mom as if it was another movie"
"3523","The perfect conclusion to a top weekend was to watch a late showing of @petsematarymov - maybe not, bit of a damp squib, found it slow, uneventful and we’ve seen it all before, offered nothing new, unnecessary remake, avoid unless you like a crazy processed cat! #PetSematary"
