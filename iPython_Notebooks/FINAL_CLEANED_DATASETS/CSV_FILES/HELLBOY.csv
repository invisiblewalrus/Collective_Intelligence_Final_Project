Never seen any iteration of this character before right now"
"3","@gerryconway <U+0001F614>-""Hell no"" to Hellboy, IMO.

If it makes more than $35 million opening weekend, I'll be surprised.

In my opinion, the Hellboy [cinematic] theme needs to go 100% serious (Zack Snyder style), or 100% ""lighthearted.""

The blend (as previewed) in this reboot doesn't come off well."
"4","Is the new Hellboy worth it? Not sure if it's just a testosterone trip with no story or a bad story with boring action."
"5","@kolbytoldme @alone_podcast @honestycheckpod @LGTHBlog @loving_film @bealoayza @OneMoviePunch I feel like #Hellboy was made as a cautionary tale of ""here's what not to do"" with a movie. I can't think of one goddamn thing I actually enjoyed, maybe outside of Thomas Hayden Church showing up, because I adore him and he needs to be in more things. <U+0001F602>"
"6","@actordougjones @perlmutations @SelmaBlair I watched the reboot last night Doug and although it wasn't as bad as I expected it doesn't hold a torch to the originals movies or cast. Ron will always be my Hellboy x"

The movie was so good <U+0001F918><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F525>
We'll definitely talk about it in our @JabhaVerse podcast"
"16","Oh my friend Milla! We know each other for years and I have been indirectly on her movies. Well, maybe you r trying to call me 'Hell boy"" well, I remember @justinbieber called me 'The Devil' on instagram too. Whatever... they r just jokes for being honest."

"18","There's gonna be rejection towards #HELLBOY due to the former director and his movies, but this version gives zero fucks about your nostalgia for GDT and does its own damm thing. Love how fast, loose, and irreverent it is."
"19","While you all freak out about STAR WARS I'm going to drop this nugget of information:

I actually prefer David Harbour as #Hellboy over Ron Perlman. Yeah I know, Perlman is an icon and was beast in the role, yet Harbour brings an undeniable energy and charm all his own."

"28","I’m left gobsmacked at the abject terribleness of #Hellboy. An utter misstep in just about every possible way you can think of."
"29","Holy crap, HELLBOY is awful. Actually, it's beyond awful. It's execrable. It's putrid. It's a cinematic abomination that should be destroyed and never viewed again."
"30","@the_snickman In honor of the film: favorite Hellboy comics arcs?"
"31","I have a ticket to see Hellboy, but do I really want to go through that?"
"32","(For the record, I could write a fucking *awesome* #Hellboy period piece film.)"
"33","Seeing the reactions to the new Hellboy film just bums me out. I really wanted it to be good but I’m seeing it almost universally being called one of the worst films of the year"
"34","I feel like Game of Thrones is a better option if this is what you're looking for."
"35","Ted, who actually stayed for all of #Hellboy, said it's not exactly bad but there are a lot of elements of the first two movies in it and that he's been around since 1943 and a period piece where he and Father have to cope with each other would be much more fun."
"36","@Thogar @actordougjones @perlmutations @SelmaBlair I wish them well but there is only one Hellboy to me."
"37","My pick is back close to the top this week! And #1 is a great movie that deserves to top this list. Check out this week’s @SiftPop BEC!"
"38","@HiTopFilms I had no hope this was going to reach 1000. But then I saw it on 900. I couldn't say no for a chance of you seeing Hellboy. ENJOY lmao"
"39","People wanted a Hellboy sequel directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Ron Perlman

Hollywood: here's a garbage reboot

People: this is garbage 

Hollywood: there's just no pleasing you people"
"40","Hellboy is a superhero franchise and HOW DO PEOPLE NOT KNOW THIS???"
"41","Such a boring ass movie man ughh #Hellboy"
"42","U really bout to tell me that new Hellboy remake is trash man wtf"
"43","@ANSISPURINS wow!  i've been hoping to find one of those!
Still gratefiull<U+0001F64F> for sharing your bottle of Hellboy Pinot Noir!"
"44","Seeing Hellboy the 2nd day in a row. I quite enjoyed it."
"45","Conspiracy theory time. I’ve had this for the longest time &amp; wasn’t sure but I’m certain it may be true

Neil Marshall was either fired from #Hellboy or quit during production

I got some proof for this"
"46","@the_moviebob At least a Luc Besson Hellboy movie would have been visually unique."
"47","Hellboy nie byl dobrym filmem ale byl... interesujaco zly. If that makes sense."
"48","Turns out I was right to be worried. :("
"49","Hellboy was... Competent-ish. Pacing all over the place. Despite being a 2 hour movie it felt rushed. Connective tissue missing. Looked pretty good. Bigger problem was the theater's projector was wigging out the whole show. Complained and got a free ticket for another movie."
"50","Now let me reiterate why I found #Hellboy so bad without spoilers 
1. The directing / acting slacked - the humour almost fell flat and the action, especially the (what seemed liked) low budget CGI was terribly setup
2. It just didn’t have the highs and lows, the depth..."
"51","If it’s R rated...they did an even worse job, this felt so PG aimed or even M at best..."
"52","Hellboy is like Venom chugged a bunch if Original Monster Energy Drink and then zooted a big ol line of cocaine"
"53","If @dasRupa endorses Hellboy, that's good praise enough for me to see it."
"54","Strong bloody violence, gore throughout, and language? Bring on the popcorn (and beer, if you’re lucky!) #Hellboy - NOW PLAYING  in theaters &amp; IMAX!"
"55","@ImperiusRexShow Did you notice before posting the picture of the Hellboy shelf or? <U+0001F606>"
"56","Whatever you do, don’t watch the new Hellboy. Gone are the days of Del Toro and @perlmutations. This is a total crap fest. If you must, then pirate it. Don’t pay a dime. It’s beyond horrible. 

#Hellboy 

Seriously. I walked out 20 minutes into the movie."
"57","I think the best part of the new #hellboy was the ending because it that dealt with my favorite character from the Hellboy series."
"58","I'm so sad the new Hellboy movie looks so bad because David Harbour is probably the only guy who fits the role but they just missunderstood everything about the source material

Come back Guillermo, come back Ron"
"59","It's like they're trying to do an R-rated version of MCU humor with lots of blood and guts while trying to cram as much imagery that resembles a heavy metal album cover with no purpose, substance or character"
"60","These films were so amazing! Loved the characters, plots, and makeup/effects. 

Trying to compare those with the new #Hellboy is like <U+0001F34E> to <U+0001F34A>. I loved the work you guys did... but I also love the reboot! 

It’s very different energy and totally earns its R rating. #success4all"
"61","@tdelucci @dasRupa I’ve heard bad things but I’m willing to give it a chance. Tonight, Hellboy."
"62","@Thogar Exactly why I don’t watch trailers like I use to. 

I can’t even find one of the trailers to show my friend. 

I found so many problematic things in the trailer. 

And then by accident Hellboy original movie was on tv do we watched it and I got more bitter."
"63","I’m so BEHIND <U+0001F633><U+0001F633><U+0001F633>
Everyone is going to see Hellboy and I still have to get to #Shazam and #CaptainMarvel man!!!! <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"64","#Peetimes and #MovieReviews are up on the @RunPee app for #Hellboy, #Little, #After and #MissingLink! Enjoy!"
"65","Today I watched Hellboy Blood &amp; Iron with the voice of @IAmCreeSummer as Hecate and featuring the late great #JohnHurt as Professor Broom"
"66","@Paulxthompson It’s utterly baffling. I mean, I consider the first movie to be quintessential Hellboy, it just got everything right for me.
I’ll confess I’m less a fan of the second, if only because del Toro’s monster aesthetic seems to wax a wee bit strongly for my liking but I still love it."
"67","Hellboy had an over $50 million budget and can’t break even a $5 million gross; it fucking sucked and I didn’t gET MY FISH HUSBAND"
"68","I'm conflicted. As a lifetime comic book fan, I try never to miss an opportunity to see a comic book-based movie. The only one I consciously avoided in recent memory was Fantastic Four 2015 because who needs unnecessary pain? Now I'm wondering what to do about ""Hellboy."""
"69","you guys think Hellboy jerks off with his normal hand or his right hand of doom?"
"70","Hellboy sucked. Not sure what I was expecting, but the cgi looked pretty bad, I groaned every time they did a joke, and the film stretches what could have been 90 minutes into 2 hours. Just stick with the Ron Perlman films."
"71","The Hellboy comics are some of the best the medium has to offer. Folklore remixed with intermittent punching, each and every tale is nothing short of gorgeous, like deep red wine. The Omnibus volumes are ridiculously cheap and deserve a place in your library. #ReadHellboy"
"72","I'm seeing #Hellboy this night. Hope I won't be disappointed?"
"73","To focus on the positive, I think Hellboy's scene with his dad in the middle where he tries to put his moral POV forward is largely pretty good. That's certainly something the film needed. Counterpointing that with the Baba Yaga's soup was a good idea too."
"74","I suddenly realized my wife planted lurid photos of herself around my comic room to see if I’d notice. 
I just noticed. And now I’m on the road and unable to take another photos. 
Make her famous #hellboy fam. Nothing accommodates boudoir photos like tentacle monsters."
"75","I’m on the last book of Hellboy and I’m savoring every page <U+0001F622> shit is so good"
"76","We didn’t quite find #hellboy to be boring....but it was the definition of a mixed bag."
"77","A word of advice to the next adapters to work on Hellboy. Watch more Hammer films and less Deadpool."
"78","Hellboy sitting at a fresh 12% RT, but I’m going in with an open (container) Mind."
"79","To its credit, Hellboy (2019) is one of the most badassedly gorey things I've ever seen but as a movie it's held back by some seriously cringeworthy scripting and performances."
"80","Hellboy tomorrow and hair appointment"
"81","About to watch the new Hellboy movie."
"82","Hello, Hellboy sucks but the last 3 mins or so made it almost worth it."
"83","This is great because I walked out of the original Hellboy back in 2004 and saw a different movie."

"89","I remember seeing some DC fans defend that piece of shit Fan4stick 2015 because ""critics were just against it because it wasn't an MCU movie."" I have doubt people like that will do the same with Hellboy. Defending awful movies because you don't like Disney seems to be a thing."

Job done."
"98","@HalieC_Lassie I’m SO excited to see it. I’m sitting alone in the back row (that way I won’t be affecting anyone else’s experience) so I can text a certain critic during the movie. I always go in with an open mind, but I’m guessing Hellboy won’t be the only thing on fire at the end. <U+0001F923>"
"99","dropping the star wars 9 trailer and title after an hour long press panel was cool and all but they coulda just hitched it to HELLBOY"
"100","Oh boy, #Hellboy is a hot mess. It's fun to an extent. Purely because of the stupidity of it. It goes at such a break neck pace but with nothing in between.  There's a lot in this film and it would be nice if it were given time to breathe. The devil is in the detail."
"101","Surprised by all the negative things I’m reading about @HellboyMovie! Saw it earlier this week and thought it was great! Fun, humor, gore, bizarre creatures and crassness all in one. @DavidKHarbour nailed #Hellboy! <U+0001F608><U+0001F918><U+0001F3FB> I’d say the movie is a demonic Deadpool but w/daddy issues!"
"102","I'm not hyped about it at all."
"103","@Plipster @clotato_doodles Hellboy without Abe and Liz simply isn't Hellboy

It's shit"
"104","@Plipster He really is one of the ones that hurt me the most when I realized how fucking retarded he is

City of Lost Children, Blade II, Sons of Anarchy, Hand of God, Hellboy, even Beauty and the Beast, he's always been this larger than life kind of guy

Now he eats his own shit"
"105","So @manticgames is the Hellboy game being delivered on the same day the new film is out purely coincidental?"
"106","HellBoy was a very busy film... stressful even. 

Also, I despise shit British accents and Big Mo was not used to full potential."
"107","I prefer the initial storyline from the first and second franchise along with Ron Perlman as Hellboy. I just hope their will be spice in this reboot with the introduction of Resident evil actress Milla jovovich"
"108","Still thinking about how Hellboy goes from fighting people-eating giants to ""maybe giants just eat people because people kill them!"" in the span of a single conversation."
"109","@JasmineSawalmah @Readus_101 No, Venom was a lot of fun, and tons of critics liked it. Hellboy is mostly boring, like a shoddy Venom knockoff."
"110","I was kind of diasappointed by Hellboy"
"111","@scotty2971 Yeah, it’s acting very strange today. I knew I should’ve just gone to see Hellboy instead of staying home and working! <U+0001F608>"
"112","I heard Hellboy is problematic so I might have to see it all by myself alone so that I don’t have to provocatively cringe I guess idk <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"113","The new #StarWarsIX trailer was .. meh.. It is as if they were made it just to have something. 
No excitement whatsoever. Similarly to Hellboy two trailers, there was a major difference in quality."
"114","Ooooof, apparently the Hellboy movie really sucks. I feel sorry for soooo many people about this. :("
"115","@stephen_smith It's a shame. I think David Harbour is doing his best too in the role, but it looks like the prosthetics on his face are limiting his emotional range even more than Perlman's makeup did.
The default expression is on it is angry which just make it look like Hellboy's constipated."
"116","I don’t think I wanna sleep in anyone of these <U+0001F92F><U+0001F92F>"
"117","Do you test defence against infernos? And do enemies always use their resilience ( like when another enemy has been hurled into them, or when Hellboy throws something at them)?"
"118","Awesome movies"
"119","@TylerWalpole Love the Art!

Side bar. Seeing hellboy this weekend and will have report for you <U+0001F602>"
"120","I’m seeing Hellboy and I had enough rewards to get a Large icee &amp; it’s bigger than my head"
"121","I just want to make something very clear. I sat through ALL of Captain Marvel and never did it occur to me that I could leave the theater. I wanted to walk out of Hellboy."
"122","Tune into @KCRWPressPlay today at noon to hear me and the venerable @katiewalshstx review #Hellboy, #MissingLink, #TeenSpirit, and #Little."
"123","So Hellboy is a mess. I wouldn’t say that it’s all bad just “unfinished”. Large parts of the movie make no sense  because things just happen w/ little explanation &amp; while some of the CGI looks amazing there are times it feels like they ran out of money and the CGI looks terrible"
"124","The most bobbins thing in the whole of Hellboy is when Merlin says  only a true descendent of Arthur can pull Excalibur out. That's ooodles of us by now isn't it?"
"125","Nope and why?"
"126","@mariannet91 Hello Marianne, as well as Us, Pet Sematary and Hellboy, we are also showing Dumbo and Shazam! at Bishops Stortford tonight. Our listings are all scheduled by the film department. I will pass on your feedback to them. Thanks Kirsty"
"127","Wow... Just wow... The absolute savaging the new Hellboy's gotten... Buggeration. I was quite looking forward to it, but everything I've read and heard suggests that they monumentally fucked up."
"128","Overall I think this new Hellboy is a 6/10 nothing to rush and see, has fun moments, but has obvious problems"
"129","The new Hellboy movie is schlock. But surprisingly, it's purposeful, well-made schlock. My take:"
"130","yall acting like Neil Marshall has ever directed anything good no shit Hellboy sucks"
"131","@JULEZ_91 It's a mini series, and its what the 2004 movie was based on. I remember I bought it to read up on Hellboy before that movie dropped because I wasn't familiar with the character."
"132","#Hellboy what a pile of s##t. I was so looking forward to this but this has taken 2 hours of my life. Ruined hellboy what were they thinking. First 2 were good. This doesn't even get half a star"
"133","I really hope in like 2 years they finally just make Guillermo’s Hellboy 3 and they explain the reboot was a really bad movie produced in-universe that’s meant to be a biopic of the real Hellboy or something. David Harbour could show up as himself."
"134","Hellboy was actually so fucken good! An R rating on movies is just so much better man, go see this movie asap its a great time!"

"173","Heard that the new hellboy is really unsuccessful and he can’t shag. THIS is why we need representation in the film industry. It’s so important that we see ourselves depicted accurately on screen."
"174","I have watched it and I am saying this boldly, #HELLBOY is overrated.

Influencers are the only reason it's trending."
"175","I wana see the new Hellboy cuz of @MillaJovovich <U+0001F60A>"
"176","Hellboy is the worst film I've ever paid to see. I can't believe it made it to the cinema - seriously save your money"

"180","Just finished #Hellboy screening it was weird because I've heard comparisons that it feels like a 3rd part and frankly it does with just a few bumps but overall I don't feel it was such a bad movie - than again it might be so, just because I'm not a true fan of the graphic novel!"
"181","Fuck #Hellboy @HellboyMovie for essentially showing the climax in the trailer.  The movie is a 5/10."
"182","My friend, who runs one of my favorite comic shops, said this today and it about sums it up for me:

""I was getting a bad feeling about it, and negative reviews confirmed it. When Cat Scully, the world's biggest Hellboy fan, is disappointed, then they've totally failed."""
"183","@GameOnGardner This is the same mixed bag I feel about the new Hellboy movie. 

I came home and said to my husband: so this must be how you felt when the prequels to Star Wars came out and they butchered Darth Vader."

Topics covered included: nudity, postal costs, Easter, sugary green tea, HellBoy (again), Disney (obviously), Microsoft PowerPoint, the new Star Wars trailer, super-noodles and road-trips."
"191","@titathetitanium @HellboyMovie That's a great number as well this movie honestly deserves this had a slow story and very bad acting as hellboy and alot of very noticable cgi errors"
"192","Big props to David Harbour who steps into big Rons shoes fantastically as the titular hero.
Unfortunately everything else and i do mean everything else around him was awful. 
Love 'Hellboy' character but i nearly walked of this."
"193","So I guess Hellboy is a no. Was gonna watch it but I haven’t read or heard one good review. They should’ve just did a sequel with Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman."
"194","A Hell Dog because it can't be called the same thing of it comes from hell, right?"
"195","Safe to say Hellboy is being dragged back to hell Lol"
"196","Oh boy...maybe cross this one off the list?"
"197","Hellboy is one of the most boring movies I've ever watched. I almost left half way"
"198","I loved that this movie is somewhere between Blade and Deadpool in terms of ""how to do a Rated R Super Hero movie"" 

But then again, take all this with a grain of salt because I'm a massive #Hellboy mark."
"199","Ok I’m about to watch the new hellboy, if you listen carefully you might just hear my heart break :("
"200","How this the 3rd movie and it’s still just called #Hellboy stop being lazy and give it a title <U+0001F602>"
"201","1/4 filled theater and no reactions from other guests. I was entertained. The run time is shorter than advertised. Overall a cool film to see. #Hellboy"
"202","Just finished watching the new Hellboy movie. God, what an awful film. I think from now on I'm going to consider the rotten tomatoes scores given to movies. Please, do not watch this movie. Watch the del toro films or read the comics instead."
"203","Saw #Hellboy last night and was not disappointed. Yeah, the CGI was a bit wonky in the scene with the giants, for instance, but that only added to its charm that channels cult-classics like ""Army of Darkness"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"". Hellboy actually cared about entertaining me."
"204","Movies bring out the worst in people. I’m retiring from movies....after I see Hellboy"
"205","I fell asleep for a few minutes, and woke up to demons ripping people in half. That was something. #Hellboy"

"210","Let all the detainees out! They'll be free! It'll be great! We'll have a party and dismantle the police state!"
"211","from 'Hellboy in Mexico' to 'The Wild Hunt', and from 'Baba Yaga' to 'Koschei the Deathless' (you'll see), #Hellboy is pure fan service at its goriest!!! @HellboyMovie"
"212","from 'Hellboy in Mexico' to 'Koschei the Deathless' (you'll see), and from 'The Wild Hunt' to 'Baba Yaga'; #Hellboy is pure fan service at its goriest!!!"
"213","I’m sad about these Hellboy reviews  I will still see it but wow they should have just let Guillermo do a third movie. On a positive note everyone looks really hot? Especially David Harbour."
"214","The new Hellboy movie was fun and often gross in a sort of Ash vs Evil Dead TV show kind of way, I think BabaYaga kind of steals the show a bit in the second act."
"215","@wesisrad Just that Hellboy is going to be a massive hit or something."
"216","Only possible good and true Hellboy film:
Hellboy in Mexico by Jim Jarmusch; with Hellboy (Tom Waits) just sitting down to drink and talk with wrestlers and monsters."
"217","Mike Mignola is rolling in his not-grave. This might be the shittiest send-off the a theatrical Hellboy."
"218","Shouldn't have rebooted the Hellboy movies."

"220","SPOILER WARNING 

Just came back from watching Hellboy with @SonicTCB and let me just say...

IT WAS ****ING AWESOME!!!!!

My favourite part is when Hellboy grabs King Arthur's sword and gains his horns and fire crown

Then slicing the blood queen's head clean off

#HellBoy"

gonna be a blast!

"223","""See the consummation of his wrath"" is a line that still gives me chills every time I think about it #ReadHellboy"
"224","Just want to get this in line... Del Toro asked fans if they want Hellboy 3 and everyone said, Yes! He went to the studio with his pitch and they rejected him and on the next few days they announced a reboot which now is probably the worst movie of 2019! Talk about karma <U+0001F605>"
"225","Alright, time to watch Hellboy, a movie I have read no reviews for and am utterly unaware of the critical consensus of."
"226","Just picked up me #Hellboy game from @manticgames from the post office! So looking forward to bringing this to the tabletop asap.
The apocalypse wont stop itself"
"227","@sophieinspace Thought you'd appreciate, I think it might be from the Hellboy comics."
"228","@Dynasty1031 Hellboy is a solid movie, giant screen worthy, saw it twice. Once in 3D and once normal. FYI 3D not worth the price on this one."
"229","Can't really remember much about what happened in the first hellboy but no one will tell me about this new Hellboy becos I must and will watch it. #Hellboy"
"230","#Hellboy  how would you put you release date between shazam and ENDGAME  why!!!!!!<U+0001F62A> you are going to get swallowed  in box office"
"231","Hellboy starts the new movie fighting luchador vampires, and if that's not the hypest shit to you then you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did."
"232","As my time and money both get tighter, I get less and less interested in seeing movies I know will be crappy just to say I've seen them. I'm not gonna be seeing Hellboy, and I'm certainly not giving a cent of my money to The Lion King or Aladdin. Why support em?"
"233","@deadautomata I would think Hellboy would offer the more entertaining theater experience.
(IMHO of course.)"
"234","Movie she's referring to is the new HELLBOY. And holy shit..."
"235","@Nessandcompany Finally Rayman and Hellboy can join forces"
"236","#QOTD ... ‘aggressively awful’"
"237","So yeah, can we have an animated Hellboy movie now please, as God intended? Thanks."
"238","Decided to see #Hellboy... How bad can it be?"
"239","Watching Hellboy as A) I literally have no life and B) the new one was so bad I need to erase it from my memory"
"240","Just remembered that Hellboy had a Shape of Punk to Come print hanging on his wall in that movie."
"241","Hellboy is Deadpool but directed by Quentin Tarantino."
"242","@actordougjones @perlmutations @SelmaBlair We will still hold out hope for a true Hellboy 3!"
"243","Goddammit for some reason I just thought of that scene from the Hellboy comics but 
""Is that a monkey?""
""He's got a lightsaber!""
*VWOOSH VWOOSH VWOOSH*"
"244","Pretend it's Hellboy's cousin, Hellguy."
"245","Hellboy currently has 13% on RT <U+0001F602>"
"246","@dsl151 Can’t be worse than Hellboy."
"247","Ron Perlman is the only Hellboy"
"248","@HellboyMovie Saw #hellboy, decent movie - nice to see superhero movies trying to mix in horror. Critics probably hate it because unlike their beloved Shape of Water you didn't have an ""Oscar worthy"" amphibian x human sex scene. Forbidden fish-love, not dark humour is what movie critics want"
"249","That’s weird because I just called up someone working at Lionsgate asking what are the future plans for Hellboy films &amp; they told me given the reception that they are bringing back Del Toro to finish his trilogy

I’m not lying at all guys, I was 100% told that"
"250","@Superman0621 Everything given how Hellboy suffered the same studio interference, hell even, than Snyder faced &amp; DCEU &amp; Snyder fans are suppose to support a director getting control &amp; freedom but you saying that just means you don’t care unless the director is Snyder"
"251","I wasn't at all opposed to a reboot because there's a bunch of other places you can take a Hellboy movie, especially one that's less fantasy and more gothic, more stark.

This is not that."
"252","I find myself checking Rotten Tomatoes the past 24 hours to see if the abysmal rating for Hellboy improved, and it barely has. I know RT isn’t the be-all end-all of film critique, but that many bad reviews is hard to ignore. My poor baby demon boi <U+0001F614> #JustLikeTheDarkTower"
"253","YOU GAAAAIZ!!!!

#Hellboy is so fucking GOOOOOD!!!!!

Oh my god!!!!!!!!!!

I was punching @bullyart07 in the shoulder and screaming at the end."
"254","@Tailorminator @jay_sera Only way i can explain this reboot is greed. 
Pelman and del Toro should have been given a blank cheque for Hellboy 3."
"255","I’m crying and laughing!! <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"

"258","@NicholasJLevi Bro honestly I don't care about Hellboy so I'm not sure what this have to do with the Snyder cut."
"259","They got the new Hellboy sitting at 13% on rotten <U+0001F345> I know that movie can’t be a 1.3/10"
"260","The best part of Hellboy was seeing the trailer for the new Luc Besson movie before it."
"261","@StormyEnt I have had and amazing morning, thank you very much. Saw Hellboy and have been watching the new Star Wars teaser on repeat for the last hour!"
"262","Captain marvel, shazam, hellboy and endgame gonna be in theaters at the same time.. N summer we still have a xmen and spiderman movie. I think im reaching superhero movie fatigue lol use to be 2 a year now we got like 7 or 8 <U+0001F605>"
"263","And the soundtrack is wicked fun"
"264","@TheEmpir3 September for people that ordered Hellboy in Mexico, Darkness Calls and/or Box Full of Evil."
"265","I'm inside a star wars hole right now, but in the meantime: this pitch started out as Hellboy comics material to read if you were excited about the new movie, which... then very quickly turned into suggestions of what you should probably check out INSTEAD of the new movie."
"266","Seen #Hellboy and.....it has good intentions<U+0001F615>. Best thing about the movie is Harbour as Big Red and the Baba Yaga scene. It was a hodgepodge of different comics bits to get to an anticlimactic ending. The one thing they didn’t used was teased in the after credits which I wanted."
"267","Milla Jovovich is given NOTHING to do. And we have no idea why she's so attracted to Hellboy. Was there some warning that she mustn't find a husband or did I dream that cos it never came up again? Why? Is the problem ANY husband? Or just Hellboy? She's a powerful witch on her own"
"268","Did the Osiris Club ACTUALLY think they were going to take down 3 giants AND Hellboy in one day? The guys on fucking horseback wearing a stags head? Why? They could have invited him over ANY FUCKING TIME."
"269","Hellboy started out like it was going to be fun - the 'it was the dark ages and called that for good fucking reason' intro was amusing, then the initial shots of Tijuana were cool and then he had to kill his friend and this very quickly became a much less fun movie."
"270","Also when they're electrocuting Hellboy when he's in the water they are also standing in the water - shouldn't they be getting electrocuted too? Cos water conducts electricity? Genuine question."
"271","oh I was about to be done bitching about Hellboy but then I remembered Baba Yaga. Her child eating, her horrifyingness, that KISS!!!! And then it all comes to nothing! Is it a set up for her as a villain in another movie? Who knows!"
"272","@ODEONCinemas Watched yesterday &amp; honestly, I didn't like the reboot, in particular, the use of cheap CGI is rubbish. HELLBOY needs the original director &amp; main actor back if it is to challenge the magnificent MCU blockbusters."
"273","@RegalMovies so fed up with #Regalcinemas! Not give provide open caption #hellboy 10:45am Mira Mesa CA. Pissed off. Refund it back. I am so tired of you not give provide OC even it said on website. This is my fourth time OC not work so far .<U+0001F92C>"
"274","@LalaRose22 Same, probably watch the new #Hellboy"
"275","@AlisonSudol One of those work days that leaves you feeling so unsure...a listen though to the Moon EP has made all seem right with the world again. Thank you for such a beautiful record. (Also super excited for Hellboy tomorrow!)"
"276","why is the ""Known for"" section on @IMDb always so wrong? I went to look up Hellboy and Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall and lol"
"277","My type of action after watching Hellboy <U+0001F60D><U+0001F929><U+0001F929>"
"278","I was planning on adding a page to this but instead I got struck by a bolt of doubt and anxiety and instead Im gonna run away to see Hellboy."
"279","So #HELLBOY wasn't THAT bad but it was a bad movie. Oddly enough though I still had fun with it. Its so stupid and terrible that I actually was entertained. Is that such a bad thing?"
"280","Hellboy 2019 handles a balance of horror and whimsy in a way that Shazam wishes it could. And anyone who thinks it's ""unimaginative"" has some explaining to do...."
"281","@skywalkerise the only movie the dudebros can have is the shitty hellboy movie that just came out <U+0001F927>"
"282","Grab your friends for a damn good time! Experience #Hellboy in IMAX &amp; theaters everywhere TONIGHT!"
"283","@SaraSorrentino I called them on an article headline telling people not to go to HELLBOY. Said it was a dick move."
"284","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Don't believe the haters. If you like humor, action, gore, and Hellboy generally, you will enjoy it. 
I don't know what movie the reviewers we're expecting, but don't let their skewed expectations prevent you from having a good time."
"285","Someone needs to redraw the Wolverine meme so it’s Hellboy laying on the bed staring at a picture of Guillermo Del Toro"
"286","Awesome movie. Well done and looking forward to what is next. #Hellboy #HellboyMovie"
"287","one time a guy put on Hellboy 2 before we fucked so that nobody in his house would hear us and he took so long to cum that at some point i just started watching Hellboy 2 while I waited for him to finish"
"288","Milla J is such a lovely woman. I might fuck around and watch HellBoy."
"289","@RosieMarx Is the new Hellboy a remake or another sequel?"
"290","@schuckster Also, the first Hellboy is better than The Golden Army. The loss of Rupert Evans's character is one of the sequels many problems."
"291","This is actually stupid. 90% of the negative reviews I've read are literally just manchildren bitching because ""it's not Ron Perlman!"" Which is ridiculous in itself. 

This is a very strange stat to be touting for a platform meant to encourage people to find new, intriguing films"
"292","@Arumi_kai I think, much more information is needed before we can make such a pronouncement. 

The new Hellboy was also supposed to be rad. 

It's currently at 11% on RT. 

Teasers mean nothing."
"293","Might be gone tonight. Watching Hellboy with the boys™"
"294","@Dignifurfpurfs yup yup. Ironically for a dude who punches demons, hellboy’s comic masculinity freaks out screenwriters?"
"295","@gerryconway Saw it last night. Would rate it 80%, but I’m admittedly a fan of Hellboy, so it may be getting a little bit of a pass from me. Nowhere near as bad as the 12% Rotten Tomato score. Go in expecting an R rated Hellboy with an unimaginative plot, but tons of great detail."
"296","@ManOfSteel37013 @GeekVibesNation"
"297","Hellboy on Tuesday for me. Game of thrones Sunday, avengers next Thursday, watching every Star Wars and clone wars episode a billion times these next 250 days are gonna fly."
"298","Fed now, so off to @cineworld Dundee to see Hellboy.

"299","Sono watched about 35 min of hellboy and I have one question . Who told the actors yeah your accent is spot on keep going ?"

"303","@talkNadvice @ValerieComplex Lololololol - I actually liked the Hellboy movies though I didn't like the comics."
"304","@talkNadvice @ValerieComplex U been looking @ me diff for yrs.<U+0001F604><U+0001F606> Not cuz of Hellboy"

Oh, the humanity."
"306","Clearly Disney was worried about Hellboy’s success so they’re desperately trying to drum up as much Star Wars news as they can scramble together. Sad really."
"307","Saw Hellboy. Was not as bad as everyone seems to be saying. It wasn't as good as the previous ones but still a good time with some pretty cool fight scene."
"308","Pour one out for those whose first experience with Hellboy is that new film"
"309","#HellBoy is embarrassing 
- Bad Editing
- Obvious ADR
- Sloppy Visual Effects 
- Incomprehensible storyline

"311","I judge my monster movies by how much I would want a toy of the film's monster and I want all the HELLBOY toys."
"312","@io9 Why all this Hellboy hate io? You’re the only outlet I’m hearing all of this negativity from. The trailers look incredible."
"313","I don't know why anyone could be surprised that Ron Perlman's Hellboy could have sex with humans.

Wasn't he gonna be a father after The Golden Army?"
"314","@gerryconway I’m really hoping it’s good. I saw a lot of anger that it’s not Perlman’s Hellboy anymore, or that the trailer doesn’t look like what people expected. I’m REALLY hoping that the movie can rise above a rocky start and thrive on it’s own merits."
"315","they actually fucking put gym class by peep on spotify im happy dude now its for the classics to go on there like my eyes and star shopping and shit like that and hellboy"
"316","@zakiscorner I'm gonna cry now in my official #Hellboy hanky. I so wanted this franchise to come back strong. These are such great comic book stories.

And especially if they could go with a B.P.R.D. mission TV show, if this was successful. Though I really wanted that to come from Hellboy 3."
"317","i honestly never thought i would say this but shazam is a million times better than hellboy

hellboy leans really hard into r-rated gore but forgets to have a compelling story first

you could take shazam out of shazam and it would still be a really good movie about family"
"318","Anyway speaking of franchise movies that may end up being crushing disappointments, I'm gonna go see the new Hellboy movie in a bit."
"319","hellboy piece of garbage"

"333","@Mega_Man_NextGn Hellboy V Ghostbusters. In theaters, 2021."
"334","I think the backlash against the new #Hellboy is less that it’s a remake of a beloved classic and more that it takes place in the UK and NOT ONCE does a Cockney character shout “Aw bloody ‘ell, it’s ‘ellboy!”"
"335","@PMoore121 We were all gunna turn up anyways, weren't we? It's kind of like when I went to see Hellboy last night and pretended I wasn't really going into the theater to watch it until it had already started. lol."

"342","Hellboy Twitter: remember, even if the reboot sucks, last year the Academy Award for Best Picture went to a movie that is more than likely technically in the Hellboy universe. They can’t take that away from us."
"343","@Timcast I'm still going to see Hellboy after you hated on it, 100 percent TLJ is feminazi garbage"
"344","The thing that the new Hellboy movie totally misunderstands about Hellboy is the fact that he’s NOT a badass, that’s the whole point. HB is a guy who loves cats and pancakes and comic books. He’s a terrible shot so he carries a huge gun. He just wants to help people."
"345","The new “Hellboy” reboot: critics are panning it as being too dull. But I liked it. It is closer to Mignola’s Hellboy with more of his original material in it. Del Toro will always have his fans - including me - but this one’s for Mignola’s fans."

"364","I need to rewatch it just to erase this from memory. 10 min into it, I could already tell it would be bad. Nothing was clear. Pointless action scenes. Annoying soundtrack. Very basic plot. Lots of confusion. No humor. The only good thing was the visuals. #Hellboy"

"394","I saw #Hellboy and the best part of the entire film was how the #JohnWick3 trailer played before it."
"395","@FB_BMB I gotta be honest, not sure why they’re obsessed with the rating, I get that the previous ones were PG-13 but two things 

1)pretty sure most of the fans were adults anyway
2)They’re acting like a demon named HELLBOY is a surprise for the R rating."

"397","They fell into the 'rated R means good' trap no one should ever fall for."
"398","So...here is a mini #HellBoy review w/ no spoilers for you all.
I may end up doing a review @ComicCrusaders 
1)  This film has no intention of being the Del Toro Hellboy.  Much more comics accurate and there is a vast gulf between this movie and previous two movies &lt;cont&gt;"
"399","Came home from seeing Hellboy and immediately watched the new Star Wars trailer.

So basically my day is just full of groans of disappointment."
"400","Normally I'll let people see what they want to see and let it be what it is. Hellboy is one of the few instances where I would actually recommend that you *do not* see it. It's nothing but a waste of your time. It's that bad."
"401","Just saw hellboy - not a terrible film, but such an inferior version to the @RealGDT predecessors that you have to ask what was the point?"
"402","Go see #Hellboy #AfterMovie #MissingLink and #Little today"
"403","I paid to see HELLBOY this morning. There were 4 other people in the theater with me. None of us were particularly enthused."
"404","The only winner to come out of the new HELLBOY is Ed Skrein who left the project for the right reasons (a white guy not wanting to play a character of Asian descent) and now doesn’t have to be in a terrible movie."

"406","@90kid2382 @DaveStansberry @Sgtzima @RealGDT @perlmutations I mean, I really didn't. GDT's Hellboy films were alright, but didn't care enough about them for a third one to happen. Would've rather seen animated films that looked like the comics, since Mignola's art is a huge reason as to why they're so iconic."
"407","@90kid2382 @DaveStansberry @Sgtzima @RealGDT @perlmutations I mean, from what I can tell from the Vulture article, Mignola seems to state that GDT's vision for HB3 would've been this big hodgepodge of stuff that already appeared in the comics. 

I just don't see the point of more live-action Hellboy movies, in all honesty."
"408","@90kid2382 @DaveStansberry @Sgtzima @RealGDT @perlmutations ...and from what I can tell, you only find it petty because you really want a GDT Hellboy 3. As stated before, it's not GDT's decision to make.

I'd rather respect the wishes of the creator than a director jumping the gun without his knowledge and proper collaboration."
"409","@90kid2382 @DaveStansberry @Sgtzima @RealGDT @perlmutations I don't. Mignola retains the right to do what he wants with Hellboy. I don't see the problem with this, especially with indie creators who would still like to keep creative control over their own work. 

GDT meant well I'm sure, but it clearly was a breach of proper conduct."
"410","@90kid2382 @DaveStansberry @Sgtzima @RealGDT @perlmutations Like, I'm sure after GDT posted that tweet, Mignola was bombarded with a bunch of fans going ""so when's Hellboy 3 gonna come out?!"" ""Tell us more!"" etc, cutting into his work-time. 

It's not petty at all. It's totally understandable."
"411","Just saw Hellboy, and you know, it made me feel 12 again, it was so unapologetically joyfully bad I had the time of my life watchin it"
"412","@CallumShephard @FB_BMB The actor playing Hellboy said it in an interview last week?  I think?  Im not good with time but that was his view of the character."
"413","Hellboy grossed an estimated $1.38M from Thursday night shows that began at 7PM.

#Hellboy  #BoxOffice"
"414","Whilst it definitely wasnt perfect, I didn't mind Hellboy. There were various parts that were super entertaining and I feel like critics are being waay too harsh."
"415","#HellboyMovie #Hellboy2019  Absolutely delivered! What a good time it was and Harbour is great as Hellboy! It was much more exciting and well written than the original definitely go see it!"
"416","just went to see hellboy and someone literally brought their 5 year old kid"
"417","Just got 8 volumes of #Hellboy in one go and I hope somewhere @VoiceOfOBrien is feeling a sudden surge of pride..."
"418","Second week since the premier of #Shazam and it's ruling at the box office with $193.7m. #Hellboy kicks of its first weekend screening today. On the other hand, Avengers End Game is just two weeks away and the big question is, can Shazam make 400m before it hits cinemas?"
"419","#Hellboy is just as if not worse as what the critic are saying. I feel so bad because I really thought it had some sort of potential.

Time to shelve the character for good, I think."
"420","@FoldableHuman It’s a stupid idea. People fight them cuz they eat people. They can’t go “oh the poor monsters” when literally every monster shown in the film is psychotic or evil or horrifyingly dark, and even Hellboy is a big asshole towards humans and says he hates them."
"421","Whom is trying to see hellboy this weekend. It got like a 16% on rotten tomatoes, but then again space jam has like 7% on there so what the fuck do they know"

"428","I really want to see Hellboy just to see how bad it is but I should probably watch Shazam since it's, ya know, a good movie."
"429","You can't go wrong with getting the Hellboy Graphic Novels. They are great."
"430","@SaintHeartwing @FoldableHuman That's a conflict that would have worked in the DelToro films, which focus on multiple ""monsters"" who aren't what they appear to be at first. They really needed at least one good monster other than Hellboy for it to work in this film."

"437","I kinda watch the new #Hellboy. If only so I could use it as a measuring device on how much I hate myself."
"438","@the_moviebob 

Sorry to bother you. I just watched Hellboy 2019 and was just wondering if some of the cuts in the movie felt janky to you as well. I'm not a film student so I can't

"453","Ouch...don’t drag Pantera over this"
"454","I hope that the best thing about this screening of Hellboy isn’t the John Wick 3 trailer that played before it"
"455","@Nsousanis @ronmarz This is absolutely fascinating!  Despite having read this story probably 4 times in the past I've only just now noticed that in the last panel, the body hanging from the noose has already disappeared by the time Hellboy turns around."

"457","@TransmorpherD @FoldableHuman Basing a single movie on a ton of Hellboy issues was a mistake."

"489","Nobody's going to boycott your movie. People just don't want to see your movie, even the critics. There's a difference."
"490","On top of that is Hellboy's team. In the OG he acts like an asshole to them and they distance themselves, he has to be better to gain their companionship. New one? Everyone is an asshole to the point where *spoiler alert*..."
"491","One of Guillermo Del Toro's running themes as a storyteller is finding beauty in horror. In Hellboy's case it was the story of a monster destined to end the world but fights to save it. This film has that also but fails because it doesn't give him anything to fight for."
"492","The key relationship in both films is Hellboy and his father. Both have struggling relationships, John Hurt as a father who struggles to communicate with his son who behaves like a rebellious teen. Ian McShane is represented as abusive and emotionally distant."
"493","As a stand alone film, it's trash, as a remake its pathetic. If the studio wanted another Hellboy film, why they went with this instead of letting the Oscar winning director complete his Trilogy? I will never know. There's more I could say, but for now I'm done with this turd."
"494","Daniel Dae Kim's character nearly shoots Hellboy dead in the climax and the drama doesn't come from ""is Daimio going to trust HB to do the right thing?"" it's ""Is HB going to end the world or not?"" which is a failure of a character arc AND a relationship."

"537","@BDisgusting @HauntedMeg I loved it. It’s everything I wanted from a Hellboy movie &amp; easily my favorite of the 3 cbms so far this year &amp; movie in general. I do wish them all success. It’s action packed &amp; chock full of monsters, hope there’s a sequel <U+0001F91E>.  Hope fans/people give this one a chance."

"539","#Hellboy (reboot) is going to draw comparisons with the original @perlmutations versions, @DavidKHarbour does the main character justice, but the story plot &amp; the mythos was left a bit on the wayside. 

I guess I miss Guillermo del Toro’s vision of the originals.

"546","Hellboy was disappointing, I would say that it was fairly whelming.
Kinda slow, but good at points.

I would not watch the movie again, even on an airplane.

However, I did like it enough that I would definitely see a sequel if it happens."

"560","HELLBOY is all kinds of cinematic hell. Atrociously edited to the point that the zingers &amp; one-liners never land. An awful script with incoherent exposition. Every VFX shot is poorly done. Not even David Harbour could save this. Ugh Neil Marshall...What hath thou wrought?"
"561","It’s a Friday night. I’m off work. The new Star Wars teaser made me feel like an excited child. And yet I’m in a non-specific bad mood.

"582","Rarely am I swayed by reviews before seeing a movie, but all the less than glowing reports about Hellboy, which I had no interest in seeing anyway after hating all the trailers, looks like I won't be checking it out this weekend. More money to save for #AvengersEngame........"
"583","@art3red I saw the new Hellboy too, personally I liked it a lot. Sometimes it was a bit confusing between ""I remember this part"" and ""wait I think it was different in the comics"", but I enjoyed the kind of mash-up it did with the comics, too."

It’s not good. It’s not good at all.

I could elaborate, but it’s as bad as you probably expected. 

There’s some nice production design, and that’s about it."

"592","@WilliamBibbiani @Matt_R_Bacon @CaptainKaye42 @Musachaudhry Yeah, I try and look at each version of a character in a vacuum. I try and look at them as if they are the only version because I feel like that’s way more fair to the creatives involved. And this Hellboy looks wildly different in tone and style from Del Toro’s."

Pros:

<U+2705> Loved Milla Jovovich - I'd watch her in anything

<U+2705> Ian McShane is a cinematic god

<U+2705> The action was killer

<U+2705>  A lot of the design was very evocative of Guillermo del Toro"

"634","its been a while since i read hellboy but i get the feeling that the comics are... very somber?? like there are jokes in it but in both movie adaptions it seems like they really bank on the wisecracking funky aspect of it and like.  it feels weird to me"

I have no evidence to support it but I think it's a nest idea"

I'm already regretting it"

Also. Never seen a Hellboy movie.

I will accept my punishment"
"653","@SonnyBunch And at least you avoided having to review Hellboy."
"654","Same sentiment. Since MoviePass imploded I've been more selective about what I pay to see. I'm on a tight budget. It sounds bad, but I'm not paying for what I'm not interested in. When I'm press I'm more adventurous."
"655","Hellboy, the rest meh."
"656","The acting was some of the best parts. Milla was good with what they gave her, David was a good Hellboy. CGI was a bit overused for what they had, story was interesting but never seems to flesh itself out."
"657","Hellboy was.... ok.  It's not horrible but I don't see myself deciding to watch it again. It's dumb popcorn flick enjoyable for the time watching. They set up sequels for this world, but it's just nowhere near as good as what Del Toro created. It's unfair to compare the 2."
"658","@LeoPelley Shazam was pretty good. Too bad Hellboy is getting really bad reviews."
"659","Hellboy was decent. SFX &amp; editing were choppy but the story was solid by the source material. Should have been a TV series though"

"663","but how is the new Hellboy movie?"
"664","Hellboy actually wasn’t bad if you’re familiar with the character. If not... I can see why the reviews were so bad"
"665","Seeing Hellboy, even though there’s a perfectly good showing of The Missing Link right there, because that’s just how my brain works now."
"666","@andycosby I love Hellboy, the original film got me reading the comics and I fell in love with Mignola's word.

This movie doesn't look good, and I didn't have any intentions of seeing it.  It's not a wise decision to tell paying customers not to give you their money."

"676","Buying tickets for #Hellboy viewing 2, and the theater is as empty as it was yesterday. 

I'm so sad right now. 

This movie is so fun. So loyal to the source material. I can't believe these shitty reviews are killing it like this."
"677","In case you’re wondering Hellboy was terrible, campy, gratuitous, cheesy. I will not understand any of those choices."
"678","instead of hellboy they acidentally started playing the first 5min of shazam and having now seen the intended movie, i kinda wish they'd just played the rest of it tbh"
"679","yep. still my favorite. so much fun and heart and cool creatures. I know fans of the comic don’t like del Toro’s movies but they mean so much to me."
"680","@DavidKHarbour I was legitimately sad because hellboy didn’t say hail to the king anywhere throughout the movie"
"681","My man, @FreddyInSpace dishing out those truth bombs in his #Hellboy review. Some top work here."
"682","@Darbmilne Oh absolutely. But the irony is, the majority of ardent Hellboy fans seem to really like this one. It’s casual critics who seem to be sitting on their pedestal on this one. I loved both of them, but Golden Army is one of my favourite ever comic book movies period."
"683","I’ll listen to the 4 of you that don’t want me to enjoy hellboy 2"
"684","Hellboy watched. Happily surprised and entertained. Don't listen to the critics reviews on things like this, if you feel like watching blood, swearing and gore, loads of it, this is your movie :D @MR_X_INC @HellboyMovie"
"685","Captain Marvel was brilliant.

Shazam! was so much fun and had heart. Excellent casting.

Hellboy deserves so much more recognition. David Harbour is fantastic. Loved this movie.

In short, you should all go see these movies for yourselves and not worry about critic reviews."
"686","Wow. #hellboy the movie where humans are gleefully mutilated, gored, slaughtered, dismembered, And More!
There is also some dialogue."
"687","@RickySpurs101 I agree with you but I feel considering the tone of the piece McShane’s portrayal made sense.  This isn’t Del Toro’s Hellboy this is closer in tone to what the comics creator wanted, a violent profane take on the character."
"688","@RealGDT I hope you include some of the minatures from ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark""  and those from ""Hellboy"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth""   3 of my favourites."
"689","If you like the #Hellboy movies you will like the new one. The story was really well done. The cgi at some points was not the best. Love the cast they all did a fantastic job. Definitely do not take your kids to see this film. The content is not for younger viewers.I give it 4/5"
"690","I am no reviewer, but here is my reaction to #Hellboy
-the movie was fun overall don’t think it deserves the 15% on RT, I am closer to the Audience score
-there’s is a lot of really cool stuff about the Hellboy Mythos
-Harbour gives his own take on Hellboy, sometimes it’s a miss"
"691","Super bummed about how disappointing Hellboy was. I knew it was going to be bad, but still it didn’t even live up to my non existent expectations."
"692","@MusicVideoSins @cinemasins

"695","Need to be honest, I wasn’t sure what to expect from @HellboyMovie, BUT I thoroughly enjoyed it! @DavidKHarbour played a very funny, sarcastic Hellboy and I was not disappointed.  I give it a 3.9/5 <U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525><U+0001F525>"

"697","So I got back from the Hellboy premiere and I have quite a lot of thoughts on it. I know critics were absolutely TRASHING it (seriously this is the worst reviewed superhero movie I’ve seen since Fantastic Four) but I don’t get it because this movie..."
"698","I am walking out of the theater after seeing #Hellboy and I already forgot what it was about."
"699","I genuinely #regret seeing the new #Hellboy #movie What a useless mess of flaming garbage"
"700","The best part of the new #Hellboy movie was seeing the extended #Godzilla preview before it. Bleh."
"701","Nice to see that the Hellboy score includes the Spanish cover of Rock You Like a Hurricane featured in the film.

I wish more media would make sure to release covers of songs made specifically for their show/film *looks very pointedly at The Expanse*."
"702","Did Hellboy have some questionable graphics maybe it did but never for anything important why blow any amount of your cg budget on shit like helicoptors instead of pouring it all into the hieronymus bosch x london collaboration at the end"
"703","Just saw the new HELLBOY and while it’s not great the 12% on Rotten Tomatoes is way too harsh. Critics seem to be hating the film! If you want to see a R rated creature feature this fits the bill. It has a lot of B movie fun and gore. Video Review tomorrow #JTEmoviethinks"
"704","@AngryJoeShow wish I saw your #Hellboy review before we bought tickets. I was hoping for something good. They need to just give @RealGDT one more movie with @perlmutations he fit it so perfectly. #HellboyMovie @OtherJoe_AJS thank alex for us too he is a great addition."

"715","crowdsurfing during hellboy is the peak of my existence."
"716","So, director of the new Hellboy movie... was it your plan to film the action scenes so poorly as to make them unwatchable?"

"722","#Hellboy (2019) was the kind of movie that I would have found a way to see as a kid even though I wasn’t supposed to see it and would have loved every second of it. It was good the way movies like Army of Darkness or Punisher War Zone are good."
"723","Sooooo.... Just saw 'Hellboy'...... It was alright. Gotta say that the acting and writing is AMAZING but holy cow was the movie all over the place...."
"724","Well, Hellboy is certainly a movie. Movie-shaped and everything."
"725","@LunarPonyo Literally everything but hellboy"

"730","so it ends up falling flat on it's face, none of the characters you love are here like Liz and Abe and the ones that are here feel so disconnected from the characters you know and love that it doesn't even feel like a Hellboy movie at all, Hellboy is..."

"745","Saw hellboy tonight. Wasnt the best, but I went in expecting a dumb fun action romp and thats what I got.

Some REALLY good fucking monsters though goddamn."
"746","The new #Hellboy movie left a literal bad taste in my mouth. I don’t know how. But I can actually taste its awfulness."
"747","Rotten Tomatoes can be so misleading. Hellboy, which critics have absolutely excoriated, was a good rock n roll splatter fest of a film. Sure the script could have used another draft or two, and no one could manage a British accent, but David Harbour (literally) killed #Hellboy"
"748","This makes me sad, but I honestly didn't have any hopes for this project from its announcement."
"749","Listen, #Hellboy certainly has its problems, but I CANNOT stop thinking about that last scene. It's the most perfect Hellboy anything I've ever seen on screen and I want to watch it on a loop."
"750","I regret to say Hellboy was just alright. I could see a great movie in it, but I'm pretty sure they got screwed by Studio execs"
"751","If Neil Marshall wanted to make hair metal Hellboy he needed to lean in to the too-little too-late energy of that last minute a LOT harder"
"752","Hellboy had its fair share of issues and rough patches but, was I thoroughly entertained for two hours? Hells yeah."
"753","Just saw #Hellboy ! Really liked. I would rate it an 8/10. It was a good entertaining movie. Do not know why people are whining about it."
"754","I’m going in boys pray for me
#Hellboy"
"755","I’m gonna say it, I liked Hellboy. It’s far from a great movie, maybe not even a good one, but it kept me entertained and I’d definitely take another round of David Harbour in the role."
"756","Someone smoke with me and let’s go watch pet sematary or hellboy or something"
"757","@RoKiSePh I wish he had had some pamcakes in the movie though. Also dunno if you watched yet but the opening scene was dope, one of my fav Hellboy stories!"
"758","@RoKiSePh Also ah it felt like this was truly a Hellboy movie. Vs the first two which were super cool and I love, but felt like a Del Toro movie about Hellboy"
"759","I’m not going to be able to sleep tonight thanks to the Baba Yaga scenes in Hellboy"
"760","@infamouslars I haven't seen it but the fact that we missed out on a third del toro hellboy for this is ................"
"761","@philthatremains IDK about that.  What if your neighbor is Hellboy.  Now then they would need one. Maybe 3. <U+0001F608>"
"762","Fanboys didn't give the rebooted hellboy a chance because they couldn't handle that hellboy was a girl."
"763","Omg please knock me unconscious so I can go back to my slightly nsfw Hellboy dream <U+0001F62D> The cats are running havoc and now I’m awake <U+0001F92C>"

"765","I kind of want to see the new Hellboy because it looks pretty 

But I also don't want to sit through something I know is going to be horrible...."
"766","That length is too short....they're doing me - I mean Hellboy a disservice"
"767","I posted this to my FB and a 'normal' friend liked it 

So not sure if fellow monster lover or just likes Hellboy 
Lol"
"768","@TessFowler Triggers, no. Just general distaste for realistic blood &amp; gore, especially gratuitous. That’s why I had to ask. Hellboy has to have some, just from the subject matter! But a rave review from someone that will lose sleep from serial killer shows said enough to peak interest."
"769","You know, the more you negatively describe Hellboy as gory the more I want to see it haha!"
"770","Saw the new #Hellboy tonight. I...actually liked it a lot. It's not an amazing movie, but being R-rated really helped it in a way that Guillermo didn't get to, and I liked the ensemble of powered freaks (though i miss Abe). Solid action too, just pretty bad CGI and a messy script"
"771","Oh I saw hellboy and I loved it tho the first half of the movie had bad pacing but it was okay"
"772","@bitterblur_ Do me a favor and go for like Library Edition Volume IV Hellboy. I mean and of the comics takes are the best but everything about the new David Harbour version is lame"
"773","All these negative reviews about #Hellboy is making me sad. I thought it looked good. Guess I have to form my own opinion about it."
"774","I follow Ron Perlman and he's a great guy. Did you know that he fulfilled a ""Make s Wish"" to spend time with Hellboy? He went through hours of make-up and  prosthetic applications to grant the wish. Then he spent hours with the the patient and fan. He also hates Trumpa-Loopa! <U+0001F44D>"
"775","“Hellboy” just did not have the soul, creativity, and heart of the two Guillermo Del Toro films. David Harbour is very bland compared to Ron Perlman as the title character and the CGI is disgusting like Easter brunch eggs."
"776","okay so like im done being super mean about hellboy here are some things that were good about it: alice and daimio were fun, i enjoyed were jaguar transformation, uh good songs on the soundtrack, baba yaga was real good, when hellboy sees what might happen if he takes excalibur"
"777","i guess my main issues with the movie were the focus on daddy issues, hellboys morality conflict about killing monsters, all the modern technology( u dont need to put cellphones in a hellboy movie guys cmon), and the weird fucking rock dubstep they played in fight scenes"
"778","I had high hopes for #hellboy, but it was terrible. Terrible acting, terrible cgi and over the top violence that didn't serve a purpose. Then there was the man eating giants."
"779","HellBoy (2019) 8/10<U+0001F918><U+0001F3FC> Ron Perlman and what he did on the big screen for the character will always hold a special place in my heart but @DavidKHarbour really brought his A game and killed it. Loved his performance and very happy to see the result of his characterization!<U+0001F918><U+0001F3FC>"
"780","I quite enjoyed the #HELLBOY film and do not care for your take of displeasure."
"781","If you plan on seeing Hellboy ... don’t , terrible acting that’s compensated with over the top gore and a pretty badass soundtrack"
"782","Hellboy will be my least favorite movie of 2019. I'd be stunned if I see anything worse than what I just witnessed."
"783","maybe u have a new game to play here @missfors 

saw this on steam and i thoguht of u"
"784","As for #Hellboy. It was by no means without issues but I did enjoy it. I felt that the tone was a little all over the place and they tried cramming too much of the source material into. It was campy and gruesome like a schlocky horror flick. The stuff teenagers read comics for"
"785","@MEGAJ0N Hellboy remake review on RT is less than 9% how is that even possible"
"786","There were no redeeming qualities in #Hellboy"
"787","Hellboy.....not really my taste in movies but it wasn't bad."
"788","hellboy with his full horns is so fucking sexy hooohhh my god"
"789","Just saw #Hellboy and... uh. Wow. Not good. Discombobulated. Great actors in a shit script. Tired tropes. Two good shots and three jokes. Not sure where it came from, where it was going or what it wanted to be. Editing very so-so. Soundtrack lost a lot of opportunities. Too bad."
"790","Why the fuck am I seeing the new #Hellboy tomorrow?"
"791","@keileykaiser That being said if the comedy is done right I'm happy, and this one seems to hit Hellboy's sense of humor right on...but what aspects of the directing didnt you like? I'm eager to know."
"792","@keileykaiser Personally I know Hellboy is known for his comedy and mixing that with horror element is key...but I would much prefer a straightforward, plainly horror Hellboy film that focused on the dark and gritty, a depressed Hellboy."
"793","@TwistyTroy  My man HellBoy and Now this news Bruh this is great"
"794","Hellboy, Very gorey, but just felt he had a speech impediment the whole time. 7/10."
"795","Hellboy sucked. Obviously."

"799","I thought about checking out Hellboy until I peeped some reviews. Fifteen percent on rotten tomatoes is not a good look"
"800","@fincherism Honestly i don't blame folks for not wanting to see Hellboy especially w/ Shazam n Endgame. It's not as terrible as the critics are claiming. Its bad,  but there's some fun to be had. At least worth a rental."
"801","@perlmutations Damn it man ... wish you and del Toro had made Hellboy 3!!!"
"802","I love the new Hellboy movie and @STARGUTSS loves Mothra"

"804","Could've filmed a dumpster fire for 2 hours an 1 minute, called it hellboy, and it would have been a better movie."
"805","‘Hellboy’ is very loud and very violent with subpar CGI and zero heart. That said, I didn’t hate it, and I’m in lust with David Harbour in that makeup."
"806","The demons in hellboy is how i imagine demons would actually look if they came out of the ground deleting a bunch of people"

"812","I saw Hellboy y'all!!!!! It was so so so good I have very minor complaints because I'm a petty bitch but I LOVED IT and I already wanna see it again"
"813","There's a scene in the new HellBoy where he kills three giants using his wit and the environment. It is an AWESOME scene."
"814","@Innsmouth_Tide I really loved Hellboy in Mexico."
"815","Saw the new Hellboy today. Pretty good. Really enjoyed it. Makes me want to reread the comics. Sad all my beaut hardbacks are back in Scotland. #nottravelfriendly #hellboy"
"816","@RagingDroidX I kind of figured it wouldn't be a bad movie, I am very excited to see it in theaters this Saturday. It looks like a different yet interesting take on Hellboy."
"817","Just got out of 6:30 screening of Hellboy a little while ago and now I remember why I avoid the cinema on Friday nights."
"818","There’s so much furry content in Hellboy omg"

"822","So. I rly have something to say here.
IT IS A GREAT MOVIE. Of course you can't watch expecting DelToro bc he didnt create hellboy. Les't stop that. Everything is a “based on“ version. And this movie its a great introduccion movie for the sequels comming <U+0001F495><U+2728>

"828","Has anyone seen the new Hellboy? Kinda wanna see if it would be worth checking out with my mom. As far as I remember, she was all about the older movies back in the day"
"829","So I just uh... saw the Hellboy reboot. I don't know what to think about it at the moment but I can't help but wish they had gone through with Hellboy 3 instead."
"830","Why is this so hard"
"831","Hellboy was pure goreporn and beyond the absolute shit plot, I had fun with the action &amp; blood. Big fan of goreporn, but even that was hard to enjoy when coupled with half baked potato story telling. My issues were purely story &amp; story execution. Everything else made it watchable"
"832","OMG literally the most annoying person at #Hellboy ."
"833","I'm literally the most annoying person at #Hellboy RN."
"834","@HellboyMovie can’t touch the original. Thin plot. Ok sndtrk. So so CGI. Not as funny as it should/tries to be. Phenom monsters, good makeup &amp; BUCKETS of blood. #Gorehound Post-credits <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>Hope it gets a second chance with 2x the monsters and a better writing team. #Hellboy"

"836","@ForVortigern « had slain her as a dragon. She came back as an aura with the grasp of 500 witches at her heels, ripped Hellboy’s heart from his chest, and dragged it with her to Hell.

"862","@DropTheDie ""This movie was bad"" and ""I want to fuck Hellboy"" are not mutually exclusive views."

"884","I get why it seemed commercially sound to give Hellboy (2019) the Deadpool treatment, but the reason this movie works is because Del Toro is such an earnest, reverent filmmaker—in this case, to a silly degree. He loves these characters and ideas deeply and fuuucking sells it."

"893","@SEAKAEdotcom That was my first thought.  Then I considered the return of Palpatine. Then I read about the $7 price-point for D+ and realized that I’ll probably subscribe.  Then I spent the balance of the day self-loathing. It got so bad I looked at showtimes for HELLBOY."
"894","@TessFowler It’s not just the reviews. The trailers look like a redux of the del Toro movies, and we’ve seen those. It’s like Andrew Garfield Spider-Man. Smells like “meh”.
Hellboy is my favorite super hero like character, the only one I still buy (when Mignola draws him) &amp; I’ll wait for TV"
"895","Shazam! and Hellboy are way closer in terms of plot and thematics than I would have expected."
"896","@IniquitousFish Maybe they meant by including more of the characters from the comics?  But I've never really seen Hellboy as being extremely gory or bloody so it seems really off-key to say that"
"897","10 people have shown up since my last tweet. Maybe everything will be okay for Hellboy. 

See ya on the other side."
"898","GUYS! The ticket taker legitimately forgot what screen HellBoy was playing in. 

It’s opening night, starts in 15 minutes and they FORGOT where this movie is playing. 

This is going to be great."
"899","Guys I’m going to see this tonight! 

Be excited for me! 

#HellBoy"
"900","Well guys, what can I say. There are two types of people in this world. Those who have seen the Hellboy Reboot and those who are unwoke sheeple."
"901","@AlastorDougal I’m not going to jail for Hellboy Duncan."
"902","The new Hellboy movie is so close to being something at some points"
"903","Ok but I just watched Hellboy and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing @DavidKHarbour bring my underlying love for Hellboy back into the light. <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F918><U+0001F480> So much yes."
"904","@FreddyInSpace This review makes me need to see Hellboy"
"905","I just saw #Hellboy and sadly it's so bad, I had my hopes on it, but I lost it the moment it started. <U+0001F641>"
"906","I knew I was going to enjoy #Hellboy from the moment I saw the 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. In my opinion, the best kind of reviews to go by are by those on Twitter who see the movie when it's actually in theaters, rather than those who see it before the film is released."
"907","I saw #Hellboy today in BTX (4K, upgraded screen size, loud AF), and what a joy it was. Yeah, some inconsistencies with story, but the ultra violent fight scenes and the matching songs were PHENOMENAL. Hell Boy had a f*cking wrestling match! Worth the watch. Didn't mind CGI. 7/10"
"908","@missfors But that it was really just, a Del Toro stylish version of it and you couldn't get out of this bubble of sorts for any future sequels. Also, for some reason...it feel it's easier for me to tell the kids to start reading Hellboy after watching this, compared to if had just watched"
"909","1. TMNT (1990)
2. Back to the Future
3. Army of Darkness 
4. Ghostbusters 
5. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.1 
6. Hellboy II:The Golden Army
7. Pokémon 2000"
"910","Hellboy was out, a bottle of rum in his left hand. He'd been walking down an alleyway, minding his own business for the most part, drunken mutterings passing his lips.

In front of him, there was a figure, and before he realized it, he was pinned to the wall.

@Sorrowfulsavior"
"911","@KatherineAlucar //I can see them going on Nazi hunting adventures and Hellboy just being all excited just to work with him"
"912","@Sorrowfulsavior ""Whoa shi--"" he could feel every fiber within him work against his will-- not something he often felt especially while inebriated. This guy was pissed the hell off and Hellboy sort of took it with a mix of drunken anger and bewilderment. 

""I don't know who th' hell you mean--!"""
"913","@CryptidHxnt Heat rose to his features and surged through his frame, feeling the warmth of Robert's palms against his chest. That was one thing that got him-- Latin, and the lack of fear in touching him.
""Obsecro."" 

The level of intimacy was... interesting. Hellboy welcomed it, oddly. But -"
"914","@rlthingy hellboy ofc"
"915","@sepiascribe It’s a generally good site. There’s a few stinkers here and there but there’s no reason for them to be biased for against Shazam or Hellboy."
"916","@sepiascribe I’ve really heard nothing but good things about Shazam. Haven’t heard anything about Hellboy except that apparently a lot of people didn’t like it too much. I think Shazam is a safer bet."
"917","Finally got home at 11. Opened at 6am and closed at 10:30pm. Gonna hibernate for a while then finish the chapter this weekend. Sorry again for the delay, but it's out of my hands. 

Also gonna see Hellboy, heard it sucked though"
"918","Just watches #Hellboy and um
.. Yeah. I feel the same thing that happened with suicide squad happened here. Script was all over the place and just felt like an adhd fest. If theres a sequel I hope the editing improves."
"919","@sepiascribe Literally going to see Shazam because people whose opinions I trust told me that Hellboy has decent gore but nothing else."
"920","@Variety I really wanted hellboy to do good"
"921","The best part of Hellboy was the 2 second Love Island cameo I said what I said"
"922","@RossFisherDavis @TessFowler First seen in Quest for Fire, blown away by talent in The Name of the Rose, vocal melt in Beauty &amp; the Beast, floored in The City of Lost Children, loved the snark in Hellboy, total respect in Sons of Anarchy, struck with his stand on Twitter...really, he's the whole package."
"923","So am I to understand that the use of “Mony, Mony” in the trailer is NOT the biggest problem with the new Hellboy movie? 

Chime in, Twitterati."
"924","So is the new Hellboy genuinely bad or is it one of those movies that will have a cult following in ten years with people wondering why nobody saw it in theaters?"
"925","Well I saw Hellboy earlier today it was not bad decent action and gore but I felt it was let down a little by the editing and some dodgy CGI for some of the scenes but I did enjoy the movie to some extent"
"926","@AngryJoeShow Hey, Joe. Watched your Hellboy review and just wanted to say that it was nothing like the comics. If anything, the old Del Toro films were more in-line with them. The movie was a complete bastardization of both the old movie AND the comics."
"927","this hellboy movie is hard to watch"
"928","Watched #Hellboy with @mah0mah0toaster and let me tell you... I was not disappointed in the least."
"929","Hellboy really just Thanos and Deadpool’s love child"
"930","@MNXMovies #Hellboy  is based on the Dark Horse Comics character ""Hell Boy"" 
#HellboyWithMNX @BirkanwarSingh @Joharsofficial"
"931","@MNXMovies Penelope Mitchell as Ganeida
Milla Jovovich as Nimue
David Harbour as HellBoy 
Ian McShane as Professor Broom 

#HellboyWithMNX @BirkanwarSingh @Joharsofficial"
"932","Remember these tense, engaging knock-down drag-out fights from the #Hellboy comics? I hope you like them caked in dribbling gore and squirting mucous and utterly devoid of tension while Niel Marshal shows you exactly how much he hates people’s eyeballs."
"933","#Hellboy 2019 is a sleazy, distasteful, disrespectful adaptation. Nothing of quality survived into the final product. If you are a fan of the comics or Del Toro’s films, it will hurt you to watch this movie."
"934","They tried and tried and tried to cram in constant references and fanservice moments. This film was supposed to make an impact like a spiderverse for Hellboy fans. So much of hellboy’s history is here - but it’s all wrong, and distorted and tasteless."
"935","The only saving grace is that this movie can not retroactively make the comic bad. Hellboy, on paper at least, is finished, and what we got was good. And Del Toro’s movies might have had minor problems, but this makes them look like flawless MASTERPIECES"
"936","I remember reading “Strange Places” some ten years ago, and wondering if this arc and these characters would ever hit the big screen. It seemed Impossible, what with the Golden Army more or less tackling the same plot, and no sign of any further Hellboy movies to come."
"937","Mood is a problem. Perhaps the biggest problem. There is not a single quiet, pensive moment to be found in this film. It’s loud and crass and ugly and it has no patience. And nearly every scene - in a HELLBOY MOVIE- is BRIGHTLY LIT. Probably to show the gore more clearly"
"938","Hellboy is a collage of a movie. It’s a rejected transplant. Events from 1956, 1960, 1978, 2006... are all sloppily pushed into a nebulous “modern day” where everyone has a fucking smartphone. Gruagach says “fuck” while Nimue watches TMZ! I’m laughing! Are you laughing?"
"939","And even if another, more faithful Hellboy film series got off the ground, they would have to get through several arcs of nazis and lovecraft before they delved into the meat of these fairytale stories. After all, it’s not like they would just... skip to them, right?"
"940","There are definitely at least three comic films way worse than the new Hellboy movie lol wtf have all these reviewers been smoking"
"941","Honestly, upon thinking about it, I’m certain people are only hating on this cause it’s not a Guillermo del Toro Hellboy 3. But I think if you read the first 15 or so years worth of Hellboy comics, this is gonna hold up as a solid adaptation."
"942","It’s official: the “movies” subreddit hates it but MY PEOPLE, the r/Hellboy subreddit loved it. A testament to the power of real fans"
"943","I feel like a real jerk for saying this based on the reviews and reddit comments, but like I didn’t hate Hellboy. I couldn’t. The action was fun, the music was great, the set pieces worked. I mean granted some ADR and acting wasn’t great, but it’s a great b movie."
"944","@FreddyInSpace I slightly agree with this except I feel it gets very convoluted towards the end of the movie.  It's really entertaining at parts and meh at others. Milla Jovovich is just boring, but David Harbour is a pretty damn entertaining #Hellboy"
"945","Thank god I grew up on DOOM. I just watched Hellboy and the violence was pretty excessive. My mom was disgusted but I’ve been desensitized lmao"
"946","Just finished watching the new #Hellboy movie. Really enjoyed it. Really hope there is a part 2 soon."
"947","@sepiascribe I've heard that Shazam's awesome and Hellboy's shit. Haven't seen any but from a review I read, it looks like Hellboy didn't play out so well con comparison to Shazam."
"948","I fricken loved #Hellboy ‘Twas awesome! David Harbour is phenomenal and the visual storytelling is super!!! If you want something unashamed to be itself, enjoy this movie!"
"949","@artofmmignola Well the new movie was pretty juvenile. Parr from Baba Yaga and the hellish demons, there was not much effective horror. Lots of action scenes with some random rock song playing. Deadpool and even Suicide squad already did it better.  Hellboy should't be like that in my view"
"950","Had time to kill since my appointment is not until 6pm (it’s still 1pm here) and home is too far. Randomly picked a movie at the mall and the one with Cole isn’t available. Long story short, I’m now seated for Hellboy and 15mins in, I want to go out."
"951","@IMAX @HellboyMovie i waited YEARS for the trilogy and instead we get a reboot that doesn’t even have the same story line, actor, or director like wtf years wasted being excited for hellboy 3"
"952","Just saw Hellboy and wow, genuinely don’t know how to feel about it. I mean I kinda love it but also it’s not really good."
"953","Saw Hellboy today, loved Mila Jovovich as Nimue, Baba Yaga design was sweet and David Harbour was a decent cast. Hated the pacing which felt far too rushed, and the tone felt too upbeat for the source material. 2.5 out 5"
"954","Why the males in my family chose Hellboy over The Curse of the Weeping Woman???"
"955","@HellboyMovie Truthfully the movie wasn't that good it was okay, it wasn't Hellboy though David Harbour is a really good actor the movie itself just took a turn for the worse. If you don't care for the story then the action and blood is probably the only decent thing"
"956","@perlmutations Dear Ron Perlman, I miss you in Hellboy reboot....where were you ??? <U+0001F441><U+0001F441>"
"957","Saw Pet Semetary and Hellboy tonight. Pet Semetary was pretty meh, and Hellboy fucking suuuuuuucked. I figured Hellboy would be bad but at least still fun to watch, but no, it’s just really not good."
"958","How the hell are you gonna have a demon man fighting giants and have that action sequence set to fucking MUSE? Who scores a movie like Hellboy with anything except shredding death metal?"
"959","id let hellboy hit it ps. @momoechis agrees with me so no one can tell me im wrong. idiots. imbeciles. fucking troglodytes and drones."
"960","I think I understand why many critics disliked the new helbboy movie. Here's three criticisms I have:
1)What Hellboy did!
2)The change from one place to another has no clear causality.
3)The villain and the stakes are boring.
#Hellboy"
"961","I do not recommend the new Hellboy movie"
"962","Hellboy doesn't have to be good, it just has to take screens away from that horrible propaganda anti-woman movie.

Funny tweets resuming again in 3... 2..."
"963","@FORM_DESTROYER Update: Hellboy now has 137 reviews and is still at 15%."
"964","I don’t care if what I like is universally loved, I still like it and that’s good enough. Lol"
"965","Time to dig into #Hellboy. Stay tunes for the pod this week!"
"966","Some sicko decided to bring a 3yo child to see Hellboy. What an amazing parenting!"
"967","@TheAnimatedBat @perlmutations ell ... good luck red :)
(Fact: he even played two parts of Hellboy)"
"968","@danieldaekim Oh I’ll be there. I’ve been excited for this movie for quite some time &amp; have been tweeting up a storm spreading the Hellboy love, whether those wanted to hear it or not. Never listen to critics, read reviews, or check tomatoe scores. They mean nothing to me. I decide. Not them."
"969","@MillaJovovich @DavidKHarbour Past few months I’d been tweeting up a storm, spreading the love of Hellboy whether those wanted to hear it or not-It’s been a blast &amp; I’m going to miss it. Excited to say I’m seeing it today. Screw the critics-What the HELL do they know? Go BIG RED. Had to say this one last time"
"970","I saw the new Hellboy and it pales in comparison to the old ones, unless you’re familiar with the comic books or the original movie it’ll be hard to keep up."
"971","@IniquitousFish well I love Hellboy, and I really wanted more of the world and character.  I hope that somehow it gets another movie and they learn from their mistakes."
"972","@Lileks Normally I would agree but have you seen the recent Hellboy trailers?"
"973","@THR Eh, just the concept of Hellboy, like Howard the Duck, is enough to keep you away no matter how good the writing is."
"974","Hellboy(2019) was just such a mess of a movie, but I had a blast watching it.
It’s B movie camp, over the top gore, messy plot, poor editing, and not a great script.
Not everything has to be great to enjoy. This isn’t great, but it’s fun as hell to see."
"975","@CorvinJLyn direct correlation between this bad rating and david harbour saying this hellboy doesnt fuck"
"976","if youre expecting a @RealGDT carbon copy youre not gon like hellboy. lets get one thing straight. hellboy belongs to mike mignola NOT gdt. read the comics guys. this movie is its own identity. do not compare this to gdt film. #hellboy #hellboymovie #mikemignola"
"977","@THR True to the source material AND brutally rated R. Makes sense #Hellboy gets scorching hot reviews!"
"978","@RealGDT You post this on the day the new #Hellboy movie comes on purpose. Weird Flex but ok."
"979","I can't help but wonder if you posted this on purpose the day a new/different #Hellboy comes out."
"980","Original hellboy can not be beat <U+0001F624>"
"981","@The_HardcoreKid @Chillguydraws Ron Perlman is, and will forever be Hellboy. Nobody can replace himself in my eyes.

Should have just made the third Del Toro movie and finished it off."
"982","Guys... the new Hellboy movie is the WORST MOVIE I’ve ever seen. And I have seen Dragon Ball Evolution"
"983","So I saw Hellboy........... I’ll just leave that here. Review coming soon"
"984","Well everyone that has left my theatre tonight had good things to say about #Hellboy"
"985","I’ve just watched #Hellboy again for the second time and I have to say, I LOVED IT just as much, if not more so than the first time. Thank you @DavidKHarbour, @SashaBianca23, @danieldaekim, @DouglasTait and the rest of the crew. And thank you @artofmmignola and @duncanfegredo ."
"986","if the fast and furious franchise can have eight goddamn movies, David can sure as shit play hellboy again. It's all i'm sayin'."
"987","Does this Hellboy movie deserve a direct sequel? probably not.
Does david deserve to reprise the role of hellboy? He damn sure does. He's perfect. He's the best part, and i would love to see him do it again. 
Like...i need it."
"988","Man, makes me REALLY sad to see Hellboy getting pummeled by the reviews right now. Not just because I was really hoping the movie would be good, but because I was looking forward to Neil Marshall's cinematic return.  That said, I'm still seein' that shit Friday."
"989","<U+0001F914> I saw the previews to it, I might check it out"
"990","Then he said ""Or Hellboy"" and I said ""I was going to see Hellboy, but the Rotten Tomatoes score is something like 13%""

This was the moment of ""the triggering"""
"991","""I don't want #Hellboy to be the last movie I've ever seen""

Perfect summary of the movie as we walked away from it"
"992","{} note to self: don’t fucking forget to go to the theatre tomorrow to see Pet Sematary and Hellboy!"
"993","@LookWhosFhtagn I trust your Hellboy opinions and will probably wait until it gets to the $2 theater. Thanks!"
"994","Ron Perlman is the only Hellboy I know."
"995","I have my spotify playlist all set to go see Hellboy tomorrow afternoon. <U+0001F918><U+0001F37B>"
"996","#Hellboy was a piece of art and a masterpiece. The original movie series has nothing on this one. Honestly this movie has the best dark art and feel to it, everything was perfect. The demons at the end really brought about the feel of terror and he'll."
"997","Just got back from seeing #HellBoy and wow... that was one of the worst movies Ive ever seen in my life. My film soul was in so much pain watching that movie. I wont rant but it was the laziest just god awful movie Ive seen in a long time. And I watch low budget indi films."
"998","I think the big reason why some folks are burned by #Hellboy is expectation.

The Del Toro movies were terrific, so they expect this movie to be on THAT level. I can tell you, it's not. It's on its own, with a rough-and-tumble style. For some, that might just work. Did for me."
"999","Its fucking hot at Ipoh now and I have to ride my motorcycle to Amanjaya bus station through highway.... I was sweating alot and i even cancelled my plan to go watch Hellboy due to the hot weather. #panasbabigiler"
"1000","@HouseIandi From what I hear, no. I had concerns about this movie based on the fact it seems to be covering an arc later in the Hellboy story. From what I heard, it draws on the story but with none of the character development or build up necessary to make you care."
"1001","@QueenHalloweenW @perlmutations Happy Birthday, sir <U+0001F38A> Like fine wine you are improving with age <U+0001F609> in all possible ways! I'm a fan since ""Beauty and The Beast"" and I love your choices of roles: ""Alien"" ""Hellboy"" ""Desperation"" ""The Name of The Rose"" are just some of my all time favorites. Thanks for all :)"
"1002","Really enjoyed the new #HellboyMovie #DavidHarbour is great as hellboy, lots of humor, Great special fx."
"1003","Hellboy (2019) is the weirdest, stupidest movie I’ve seen in a long time, but I admire the team for just going for it."
"1004","I saw #Hellboy with my oldest son and it's a lot more gory and graphic than I expected. Not bad, but hard to hear some dialogue, and it was a little rushed and disjointed. Still a fun ride. A weird reboot of the movie series. Don't take kids."
"1005","I thought this was an onion article but then I saw who posted it <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"1006","The new #Hellboy is so metal<U+0001F918><U+0001F3FD>I <U+2764><U+FE0F> it!"
"1007","Come on I'm excited to see Hellboy 2019 already 1:30 PM get here already"
"1008","All in all Hellboy really isn’t as bad as people say it is but Im not at all saying it’s good"
"1009","My thing with Hellboy is that there’s a good movie in there somewhere and had a lot of potential but god damn the editing was got awful and every movie that’s prolonged involves king Arthur is gonna be trash just like The last knight"
"1010","The only filmmaker who should be allowed to adapt HELLBOY is Akira Kurosawa."

"1013","guillermo del toro wrote this"
"1014","Saw Hellboy...look, if you’re looking for deep meaning and a solid story with deep character development, it ain’t for you. If you want a silly, fun action movie that will give you ideas for your next @Wizards_DnD campaign then maybe check it out."
"1015","@mars_stu Well, this really was a movie for the fans. I wouldn't show someone this one to introduce them to Hellboy. I can see why it would have been odd, at best, to someone who hadn't read the books. But I think fans of the books will like it."
"1016","Ok, #Hellboy isn't perfect, I've got my quibbles, but that was made for the fans and I LOVED IT. Screw the critics reviews and GO SEE IT."
"1017","There are TWO end credits scenes for #HellBoy !!! 

Dont leave until the lights come up!! TWO scenes!"
"1018","hellboy: I'm a Capricorn and you're a crazy bitch 

me: wow a capricorn icon"
"1019","Hellboy is bad. Not as bad as reviews say, but still pretty bad IMO. I'd give it a 3/10."
"1020","i will totally understand why people hate this but god imagine a del toro/harbour hellboy movie <U+0001F629><U+0001F629><U+0001F629><U+0001F629>"
"1021","For $50 million I could’ve made a fucking puppet show better than Hellboy"
"1022","@JamesGunn @perlmutations fuck it. Ignore it. I will most likely enjoy it.@washingtonpost Surly their are better things you guys could be Writing about."
"1023","But what's with the ghost thing coming from Alice's mouth, gross! Also Hellboy should be dead by the end of this movie"
"1024","So the new Hellboy is terrible which sucks because there are some element in this reboot that I kinda like."
"1025","Havent heard much about #hellboy besides a couple reviews. But what I DO hear is that most people would prefer #GuillermoDelToro back at the healm along with #RonPearlman and the rest. And besides. Guillermo won best pic for #TheShapeOfWater"
"1026","Hellboy was more disappointing than my parents are in me."
"1027","@HarryThomasPic Also I don't think the haters of Hellboy 2019 will love my female lead superhero movie cuz people will think the movie is boring Ryan O'toole SC Reviews,, Late movie reviews, you etc."
"1028","@LisaFoiles @neillarson I wish you were red Sonja in the new movie if you don’t want to that’s fine I understand I guess Scarlett Johansson or Karen Gillian instead also I understand why you don’t want to be in it cuz the hellboy film got bad reviews also."
"1029","Bottle of wine, ARAMs and some Peep Hellboy on Firday night <U+0001F5A4>"
"1030","I didn't know there was a new #Hellboy movie but what I heard about it so far. Maybe there a good reason why this movie wasn't well advertised. They hade no faith in it."
"1031","@SylvaFilmCritic Yeah, dont really take RT scores too seriously now. Best to go make your own opinion about the film! #Hellboy"
"1032","Saw Hellboy (2019) today. I have to say, I’m a big fan of Del Toro’s version, but was willing to give this one a shot. To be honest, it was only okay at best. It wasn’t a great movie but it wasn’t horrible either, so just kind of meh. Maybe a sequel could be done better."
"1033","So in summary by the way don’t see Hellboy if you have any questions about the actual movie or story just ask"
"1034","A hero will save the world… or go to hell trying. #Hellboy - NOW PLAYING in IMAX and theaters everywhere!"
"1035","About to take a day and see Pet Semetary, Hellboy, and Us. I'm disappointed in myself for slacking on seeing horror movies"
"1036","Oh my god really!?! Are they that desperate for good quotes for the tv spots <U+0001F602>"
"1037","Avenge this. Get your tickets to see #Hellboy - NOW PLAYING in theaters everywhere! Experience it in IMAX."
"1038","anyway. time for bed. seeing hellboy with dad tomorrow and then dnd tomorrow night. ahhhhh"
"1039","I’m so sad. The new Hellboy movie is not good."
"1040","These girls won’t stop giggling and they’re ruining Hellboy for me <U+0001F624>"
"1041","#Hellboy seen. 

Definitely could have been better, but lots to like, too. Loved the straight-from-the-comics references. Loved the more grounded (if you can call it that?) myth &amp; folklore. Definitely, unapologetically, R."
"1042","@DavidKHarbour shines as Hellboy, it's an awesome take on the character, and it's lovely to see so much of the comic material bring incorporated into the movie. If you're a Hellboy fan, I think you'll get a kick out of it, it's worth an open-minded chance."
"1043","A couple sitting next to me at my #Hellboy showing had a full fledge conversation for an hour into the movie. Feeding each other wings <U+0001F612> couldn't hear the first half. They also started arguing about who paid which uber. Then just decided to leave midway #amctheatres <U+0001F620><U+0001F620><U+0001F620><U+0001F620><U+0001F620>"
"1044","Seriously, go see it. Hillarious movie."
"1045","...

Now they're just being desperate."
"1046","There are certain things in this life that can get a genuine smile out of me, the dumb apocalyptic fun of doom, the diabetic levels of sweet romance animes when they're well done, and going to see #Hellboy hit that apocalyptic fun spot so much, it was an absolute blast (1/2)"
"1047","@washingtonpost @RealGDT's Hellboy and Hellboy II: The Golden Army are!"
"1048","HELLBOY is bad but not bad enough to be interesting. There are fun moments but it's mostly just lifeless. Kind of just boring."
"1049","Sure are a lot of characters in HELLBOY."
"1050","Genuinely disappointed the new Hellboy movie flopped"
"1051","I went to see #Hellboy and I’d love it. It was a good movie. <U+0001F3A5><U+0001F642>"
"1052","Hellboy tries to be both an action and a horror movie, and they should have just gone with straight horror. They were so close, but just couldn't  let suspense build."

"1054","Yesterday night I watched #Hellboy and even though there are improvement that could've been done, I enjoyed it. David Harbour as Hellboy is what I wanted. I did not like the original hellboy movie so to see him being played like it was in the movie, I am happy. Go watch it."

"1064","Just back from the new Hellboy film. I enjoyed it, lots of cool bits from the comics in there. Would have like the director to have toned down the gore and swearing... merely lots of gore and swearing would have been sufficient. 

Really enjoyed the Lobster Johnson bits too."

"1106","Man... Hellboy.... David Harbour was really a good call, but a good majority of his scenes sucked. Same with the rest of the cast. The plot was good enough to get through, but you can tell what was hurt by editing. Terrible script, editing, direction, CGI, score, and acting
4/10"
"1107","Some of y'all are really encouraging people to watch hellboy because ""you should support superhero movies that aren't marvel movies"" when Shazam exists!? Shazam is critically acclaimed movie with a great audience feedback, please watch that instead of the pointless hellboy reboot"

"1114","@Kattknights I'm sorry i just cant get behind that. I know the movie is probs a lot of fun but this just seems so...not Hellboy. If it was in any other movie it would be great but seeing HB do all this just doesnt feel right."
"1115","another Spider-man reboot, but we cant say the same thing for Hellboy. The original films were good and found a way to drift from the books, we've seen a different hellboy but we havent seen a super accurate Hellboy. But now I feel like im going to have to wait 20 years to see it"
"1116","For Some Ungodly Reason, Hellboy Is Back

A common refrain in film criticism these days is that there are too many superhero franchises. Studios’ nonstop efforts to launch new cinematic comic-book brands have choked theaters to the point where you can barely enter a multiple…"

"1118","Character's inability to what?"
"1119","Just got back from seeing Hellboy!

Oh gosh! Oh geez! Man oh man! What a completely baffling movie that is. It was, by far, the most true to the comics as far as... individual events/images, but also completely missed the tone? The acting was terrible. The editing was worse."
"1120","Wasn’t a huge fan of the original movies due to their departure from the comics but they always managed to tell a coherent story with consistent visuals that still hold up today . #Hellboy"
"1121","#DavidHarbour was great as #Hellboy &amp; I Iiked it in parts but overall it’s a flawed film with pacing that’s just erratic,CGI that’s good in some areas but shoddy in others &amp; a thoroughly underwhelming climax. Contd."
"1122","Being an ardent fan of the comics, I just had to see the new #Hellboy film despite the negative reviews.While it does feel a lot more faithful to the source material,it doesn’t do a good job in telling a coherent story &amp; just comes across as feeling all over the place. Contd."
"1123","I am delighted to have seen the Hellboy characters I love on screen and interpreted in a new way. And that’s all that needs to be said about that."
"1124","Lol I'm currently sitting through the worst movie I've ever seen #Hellboy"
"1125","Fam this headline cannot be serious lmao"
"1126","ok, so Hellboy is a pretty medium comic book movie.
Nowhere near as bad as what the RottenTomatoes score would lead you to believe.
It has some pretty severe pacing issues storywise though.
Lots of gore that didn't really need to be there and lots of swearing that sounded dumb."
"1127","@GravityDaemon The first Hellboy movie was really before the big huge Marvel craze took off.

So I guess someone figured they could get a new franchise out of it.

Of course, once you'd told Guillermo del Toro and Ron Pearlman to fuck off, you've kinda cursed your movie."
"1128","@THR Possibly the reason the original @hellboy stayed away"
"1129","What"
"1130","I think the latest #Hellboy reboot should of had a all female lead."
"1131","This is a wild headline"
"1132","@AngryJoeShow When I heard that Harbour was Hellboy I thought it was good choice and liked they did not shy away from gore in this one. Now I hope this will be one of those movies that majority dislikes and I like, but it seems it will not be even close to earlier movies."
"1133","y’all we really saw after but payed for hellboy so they wouldn’t get our money lol"
"1134","Hellboy is not a good movie. But the weird saggy boobs, one eyed witch woman might remind the TESD ants of Walt...but the film is gash. #JosephNo #TESD #Wolf"
"1135","Hellboy is pretty much my favourite thing, I would love to see it as an animated tv show (not like the one off animated shows there are now) so it can be done at a way more measured and considered pace.  It’s an amazing, huge and rich world to explore with a unique tone."
"1136","Controversial opinion:
Del Toro's #Hellboy movies were never really that good. While this new movie is really dumb it was fun as hell. Would recommend as an adrenaline charged, zany, guilty pleasure movie."
"1137","It looks like the low budget porno version of itself."
"1138","If you like shitty schlock horror b-movies like Army of Darkness then you’re going to love #Hellboy. If you’re not a fan of movies like that then this one is not for you."
"1139","#Hellboy might have some narrative issues, but putting those aside it is an extremely fun, campy, and crazy gore filled monster movie."
"1140","the troll market scene in hellboy 2 has better imagination and character design than anything star wars has ever done"

"1149","Okay here’s what the Hellboy movie felt like, not like a bunch of episodes of a TV show put together, it felt like you’re watching the entire archive of a youtube channel that spent the last several years making very professional 3-minute Hellboy shorts."
"1150","I hope that if this Hellboy movie gets a sequel, the sequel is an 8 episode Netflix series instead of another movie"
"1151","There’s a lot of gore but it’s very like, stylish, deliberate, designer cartoon gore. The movie felt like a comic but maybe not nevessarily a Hellboy comic. Like of this same kind of colour and frantic pace and stylish gore was on a 2000AD property, it’d be flawless"
"1152","I liked the new Hellboy more than I had been told to prepare myself to but WHOOF I don’t think I’ve ever seen a feature length movie with such a complete absence of breathing room, I’ve never been more stressed out by the pacing of a movie"
"1153","The new hellboy movie isn’t nearly as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. It’s an over the top violent action movie about a demon who shoots people in the face with a giant magnum, what did any of you honestly expect? I give it a 7 out of 10"

"1184","The Hellboy reboot is about as bad a film as I can comprehend being made; every single aspect was lazily slapped together without any real care or motivation. Whilst not blameless, I don’t think the blame lies on the cast or crew; it was clearly a studio cash grab from day one."
"1185","Once I messed up Hellboy and bellboy"
"1186","While everyone piles on Hellboy I'm sort of gutted because.

"1205","@lizzylemondrop @TheWire2 Don't get me wrong, there are some parts I like about the first movie (eg: the clockwork guy) and it's still better than most comic book movies at the time, especially with the style. But I don't think it really captured the spirit of Hellboy and I was hoping the reboot would."
"1206","@lizzylemondrop @TheWire2 Is it weird that the things I didn't like about the GDT Hellboy movies are some of the original stuff he introduced?"
"1207","@lizzylemondrop @TheWire2 Sorry I went a bit of a tangent then. All the twitter noise about Hellboy has frustrated me, especially with all the 'we want the reboot to fail' people."
"1208","@lizzylemondrop @TheWire2 Then yeah, it's the opposite with me. The frustrating parts for me were some of the changes. Like how making Hellboy and the BPRD a secret instead changes HB's motivation, changing HB's aging makes him way too immature, and the love story creeps me out knowing their backstory."

"1251","Gee, THIS wreaks of an ""I'm right, you're wrong"" Holier than Thou attitude...

And yes, I'm fully aware that this dickweed was referencing Talladega Nights. As if the warning signs for how bad #Hellboy is couldn't get any bigger..."
"1252","BTW, I might watch the Marshall #Hellboy film just to see how bad it is. If it is as bad as it seems and as people make it out to be, then I'm better off sticking with the comics and the Del Toro film from 2004 (and, to an extent, the animated movies and HBII: The Golden Army)"
"1253","I think I should give this moment in time a name, when the new #Hellboy turned out to be one of the most reviled movies ever and when people praising it seem to be paid off #HellboyGate. 

Either that, or we have a new Batman V Superman on our hands..."
"1254","And oh, my god, this guy made a Fairly Odd Parents image where the character rips a picture of Perlman's Hellboy in two! When a movies fans seem THIS butthurt to the point of being paid off by the studio, you know that you're in some serious Batman V Superman shit!

#Hellboy"
"1255","@lizzylemondrop I saw someone articulate the different between this and del toro’s Hellboy in a crude but succinct way - 

Del Toro’s Hellboy fucks. 

Really, Selma Blair plus pyrokenesis. Who wouldn’t want that in their movie?"

"1260","So, um, Hellboy.

Did anyone else have the experience of being put off by the trying-to-hard hyperness of the first trailer, and then kind of excited by the second one?

Unfortunately, the first trailer is much more representative of the actual movie."
"1261","Every character, even other major ones, get exactly one note each to play. Hellboy is an angry teenager. Daimio is sarcastic and annoyed. Alice is sarcastic but slightly warmer. Bruttenholm doesn't really have any characteristics beyond being Ian McShane."
"1262","I generally don't want to spend a lot of time pooping on stuff here. But 19!Hellboy is just... overstuffed. Tons of stuff popping up for 5 seconds, and then never mattering again. Setups and payoffs, to the extent it does pay off, happen within 10 minutes of each other."
"1263","@NickDCarver @fightpunch Del Toro's were good, imo. Don't know why they didn't stick with him. But animated with that Hellboy comic style would be awesome. Just thinking about it reminds me of SwatCats and that intro."
"1264","@HeirOfPerdition //which would be awesome as well lets be honest lol, just not hellboy 2 plot pls it felt a bit rushed"

Note- I've never read the comics.

Am about to go into US next and see whats so frightening about it!!
Will let you onow which is best in a couple hours!"
"1272","So what I read about Hellboy 2019 is basically this: corporate sticking it’s many penises where they don’t belong. The movie has over a dozen producers. I hear Neil Marshall has made some good stuff but I’m willing to bet he’s director in name only here."

"1308","@TSnappening @THR It’s really, really NOT true to the source material. There’s not a single swear in the comics, and there’s zero childish gore. Also Hellboy isn’t a douchebag."

"1310","@IniquitousFish @Glimmerling It's a shame, honestly. I really like David Harbour too, but the costume design and prosthetics don't even come close to the hellboy in the comics.

i have a ticket (it was free) to hellboy in an hour. apparently it is absolutely fucking garbage.
is it even worth my time to go"

"1400","@boxcar_michael My question was did we want or need another Hellboy?"
"1401","I love the Hellboy comics, and I don't  think the del Toro movies are very faithful to the plot, characters or even really tone of the comics. But like...who cares. They're great, and I'll take unfaithful but great over faithful but crappy any day."
"1402","Haven't seen the reboot yet but from what I'm hearing, the respective Hellboy adaptations sure seems to me like proof that faithfulness to source material is overrated."
"1403","Hellboy punya storyline macam bersepah tapi straight to the point, killing scene was made real no wonder strictly 18+"
"1404","Wait, are you telling me that Terry Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is FINALLY out and I went and saw fucking Hellboy instead?

F.M.L.

I can't even have the satisfaction of knowing I saw a single digit rotten tomatoes score movie now either, seeing as its gone up to 15%"
"1405","Ok so rewatched the RDJ Sherlock’s last night so deffo up for the new one (2021<U+0001F97A>) however tonight I’m going to watch the Two Hellboy movies in protest of ever setting my eyes on the abomination of the latest one !

"1407","The new #Hellboy movie is so fucking good. It's different that the Del Toro films, but it finds a way to stand on its own and give us an exciting action filled adventure with one hell of a ensemble of characters. I can't wait to see more after this."

Crossing my fingers that Hellboy isn't as bad as people are saying..."

(well, a bit of housework, but no work work)"

"1425","I feel vindicated - @HelenLOHara's @empiremagazine podcast is the first review I've heard of #Hellboy and we agree on every point!"
"1426","Hellboy is truly unredeemable. What utter utter horseshite. 

It’s amazing how much it missed the mark."
"1427","anyway lilith and i saw hellboy last night and immediately went back to her place and watched the gdt ones which. i think says it all."
"1428","I have access to three (3) seperate streaming services and not ONE of them has the first hellboy movie this is a direct and personal attack against me specifically and I will not stand for it"
"1429","@perlmutations So, now that the terrible Hellboy reboot has, predictably, bombed, can we get you, del Toro, and the rest of the team back to do the end of the trilogy as it should be done?  It just seems to me that all of us are waiting for that film."
"1430","Hellboy 2019 Review: Going I’m I had 0 to No expectations and if you see this movie that way you will enjoy it... yeah it has a LOT of issues and no it is nowhere mere the originals but it is very enjoyable I had fun time at the movies and that is all really need."

In the end they should have made Hellboy III... but this will do...."
"1432","Just heard about Neil Marshall being messed around by stuffy studio interference, for the new Hellboy picture. I know they're doing what's best for the production, but isn't that getting trivial, for starters? Studio Interference is encouraging the director to be a better (1)"

"1434","Hellboy a monumental disaster then aye?"
"1435","the new Hellboy movie is bad? saw that coming lol"
"1436","Saw the new #Hellboy. 

Sigh...

I have a hard time believing Mike Mignola had anything to do with this. It’s says he’s a producer in the film, but there’s no mention of him on IMDB. I’m also very surprised that this came from Neil Marshall. I love Dog Soldiers and The Descent"
"1437","#Hellboy (2019) is like the Batman and Robin of the Hellboy franchise. Nipples in the batsuit and everything. I miss Guillermo and Ron Perlman. This is a studio’s weak attempt at popularizing Hellboy as a franchise. Frenetic style with very little substance"
"1438","#Hellboy (2019) is a huge mess. It’s all over the place jumping from scene to scene to different fragments of storylines from all through the comics. And nearly every bit of that storyline is changed to the point that it’s barely recognizable."
"1439","@KZvonaric The real  Hellboy"
"1440","@manticgames any plans to release resin Hellboy miniatures in the future?"
"1441","Sasha Lane’s “British” accent in Hellboy is honestly terrible. What was she doing in that role? <U+0001F440>"
"1442","if the fact that Neil Marshall directed it didn't convince you to go see it, this should, stop listening to critics and go watch it!"
"1443","Words cannot express how much I love this man"
"1444","@JimHowick I saw the new Hellboy which is awful. I rewatched the vastly superior original and I had no idea you were in it!"
"1445","@THR Honestly, I hope so. This is a truly atrocious film with nothing to love in it. If they can't give us GDT's Hellboy 3, then they just need to stop. Crazy that they did this when he's been trying to making HB3 as recently as 2017. Such a crime."
"1446","@Boobipede Lmao me seeing this lined up with deciding to look up a quick score on the new hellboy and I am full of fear instead of optimism"
"1447","HellBoy is bad, and a reboot apparently. :c"
"1448","Am I the only one excited for the new Hellboy movie <U+0001F643>"
"1449","Seeing a lot of the critics saying how bad the new #Hellboy is and honestly I went and saw it last night, and left the theater hype, it had tons of action, humor, great effects along with way more of the fairy tale horror side of the hell boy universe and I hope there’s a sequel"
"1450","So sad that we've come to this place.  We need to impeach Hellboy."
"1451","@AliciaMarieBODY Seriously don't bother. That movie sucked. They should have just made Hellboy 3 instead. Let Guillermo del Toro finish his trilogy because they really messed up this new Hellboy."
"1452","@perlmutations Happy Birthday to my birthday twin and best Hellboy!"
"1453","@PurpleFilms88 @HellboyMovie I’m glad to hear it! Might just watch it only to see him as hellboy"

"1457","@_adornx3 I know but I really wanted to get out the house the other night. I loved it too, imma end watching Hellboy on Tuesday"
"1458","@thebestdayyever @policepolice if hellboy and lonely ghosts aren't apart of that i stg"
"1459","@russellgoodson1 @THR Sounds like it is disappointing all the kinds of people who would never choose to see it in the first place.  Who knows, maybe it will exactly what Hellboy comic fans would want in a Hellboy film..."
"1460","@IGN When they made hellboy pink that should have raised a red flag"
"1461","So today's @cineworld viewings:
Wild Rose (5/5)
Missing Link (4/5 and family friendly)
Hellboy (2.5/5 maybe 3 with a couple beers and friends on home release)"
"1462","Straight to box office hell. Lionsgate's HELLBOY fired up just $5M on Friday, and unless satanic families show up this weekend, and embrace this dark horse, the $50M reboot will be relegated to box office purgatory."
"1463","@RottenTomatoes I haven't seen the movie but I feel that the movie is getting such a low score because so many can't avoid from the anger of this not being Hellboy 3. All the reviews I've read all mentioned Hellboy 3, Del Toro, etc. This is a reboot so treat it as a whole new movie.."
"1464","Hellboy 2019 is the One Punch Man Season 2 of the movie industry"
"1465","I bet @perlmutations is watching the new HellBoy movie reviews and laughing his arse off. From the trailer it was always going to be a disaster - like a slow motion car crash. <U+0001F602>"
"1466","Wow, I liked the new Hellboy a lot more then I thought I would. Great creature designs and gore."
"1467","Just got out of #Hellboy and I was right it's #Venom all over again. Don't listen to the so called professional film critics and reviewers....the movie is fucking fantastic and a blast from start to finish, comic accuracy, gore, humor, horror &amp; metal <U+0001F918> it was great! Solid 8/10."
"1468","What i find funny is that they were okay in casting a half cast londoner as an Irish redhead character tho.

Still loved the movie tho"
"1469","God damn i fucking loved #Hellboy definitely will make the real Hellboy fans and comic readers happy."
"1470","I ain’t even got to tell you that hellboy was good, that was my type of action and fighting I loved it."
"1471","@perlmutations 
Fine you win, my train wreck mates and I will fund Hellboy 3. I only ask for a cameo, say, distraught man fleeing building of theatrical reboot."
"1472","This preview of the 2020 presidential election looks dope"
"1473","@MarkKolpack @ArcLightCinemas @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour @MillaJovovich I’m going on Monday to see it! Got a Hellboy funko  and poster from the theatre I work at today"
"1474","Really liked Hellboy. Don’t understand the bad reviews. It was more like the comics than the original. Lots of fun"
"1475","In its first two scenes we get

1) Screaming severed head
2) Hellboy wrestling a luchador in a wrestling ring
3) Sarcastic narration explaining stuff we may or may not even need to know
4) Bad CGI

I was in love

And then it kept going and got blander"
"1476","HELLBOY gave me everything I wanted and more in its first two scenes and then got worse as it went on and gave me a bunch of things I didn't need."
"1477","@JohnnyAlpha81 @Gedaffa_Koff Well, remember the Del Toro Hellboy films were PG-13 and very much worked for families wanting to see trolls, faeries and other folklore and mythological creatures in this universe. So I wouldn't assume R-Rated was even needed to make it entertaining. Those movies are incredible."
"1478","@JohnnyAlpha81 @Gedaffa_Koff RT has definitely done damage as an 'aggregator' that has turned its scores into reveal events.

Unfortunately, the extent of negative reviews with #Hellboy is beyond normal. That can impact the wider general audience attendance. Though an R-rated movie is the other hurdle."
"1479","@cax_14 Because Hellboy is an accurate representation of the legend of Arthur."
"1480","I just don’t think you’re ever gonna beat the pitch perfect casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy"
"1481","One of the big improvements in Hellboy 2 is getting rid of the boring audience surrogate agent character"
"1482","@ttersucksbutt Certainly true, but not true of Hellboy"
"1483","There’s a better movie in the middle of the new Hellboy about McShane and Thomas Hayden Church as Lobster Johnson fighting Nazis in the 40s. Should’ve been the whole movie"
"1484","Watching the first Hellboy and it’s truly insane how aggressively worse the makeup design is in the new one"
"1485","The GDT Hellboy nails the father and son relationship between Hellboy and Prof Broom. In the new one, they fuckin hate each other for some reason"
"1486","There’s like a 10 min Lobster Johnson scene in the new Hellboy and it actually rules and made me wish we had a Lobster Johnson movie"
"1487","I don’t care if he’s dead and the franchise has been rebooted, I will always say the title HELLBOY in a John Hurt voice"
"1488","Hellboy is bad, very bad at times, but not atrocious. The first half is ok, the action when not edited to hell and back or obscured by darkness decent, and Walfisch's score (not the disastrous soundtrack) is good. I enjoyed the lead trio well enough and a few scenes work. 4/10"
"1489","some serious karmic justice in this HELLBOY flop after they didn’t let GDT finish his trilogy"
"1490","To preface, I love the first two movies. I also love the comics. This version is more true to the comics.  Hellboy is more visceral, less compassionate. The movie is hyper-graphic (American Gods level) and a disjointed story. Daughters and I very much enjoyed the movie."
"1491","@CurtisMcQueen8 I have soo much stuff here!!! hehehe Im a 54 yr old child
Now if you excuse me... Im taking my Hellboy plushie and pop to see his movie!"
"1492","I’m actually wondering of what David Harbour &amp; Neil Marshall is thinking right now about Hellboy’s Reviews."
"1493","@WillamKelley @Lionsgate Yeah, lionsgate fucked themselves over with this one, it’s definitely disappointing cause I’m a big Hellboy fan &amp; the only things that I respect the movie of is the comic accurate things that they put into the film."
"1494","If there’s anything to criticize it’s that they tried to cram in some eight different stories / plot threads that occur over the entirety of the hellboy catalogue into a single movie and expected a casual viewing audience to just roll with it"
"1495","Like there are so many side plots that took years to metastize and connect to that conclusion all in 2 hours and must be kind of overwhelming or strange to someone that wasn’t already a fan of Hellboy"
"1496","The gore was a little excessive, and I think the heavier facial makeup hindered @DavidKHarbour’s expressions a little, but I enjoyed what he brought to the role (this coming from a huge fan of @perlmutations’ Hellboy)."
"1497","@Smithkids I woulda said Hellboy  but he needs to get the hair right hahaha  this looks like the product of if Hellboy and the Incredible Hulk mated  <U+0001F602>"
"1498","@FreddyInSpace Jesus, it’s like no one can like or dislike something without people claiming there’s an agenda behind personal taste. I loved Hellboy, and I’m seeing it again tonight before it leaves IMax, these pointlessly negative people can bugger off."
"1499","Hellboy (2019) will from now on be known as The Big Hellboyski and I won’t call it anything else <U+0001F602> @aarondicer"

"1502","The fight scenes in Hellboy are amazing"
"1503","@Reece_Lively I still want Hellboy 3 <U+0001F614>"
"1504","@Zwelihlekhuzwa2 Difference here is that #HowToTrainYourDragon3 didn’t have any new competitors for the family-kids audience it’s focused on. #Shazam on the other hand will be sharing this public with 2 newcomers, and one of them (Little) is overperforming and expected of beating #Hellboy’s debut"
"1505","About to go do a double feature alone, watch Captain Marvel and Hellboy."
"1506","Saw that one coming. Bummer."
"1507","Un movie marathon, ça fait longtemps. Cc @Hokube

"1508","Hellboy 2004 is one of the best comic book movies of all time.
Fight me."
"1509","Should’ve came out in October"
"1510","If there’s anything to learn from #Hellboy it’s that making a comic adaptation hyper-violent and R-rated doesn’t instantly make it good or profitable."
"1511","You're welcome. :) Thanks for coming on @siftpop today!"
"1512","Hellboy about to start. The hype is real."
"1513","I’m going to attempt to share my detailed thoughts about the Hellboy movie WITHOUT indulging too heavily as a huge fan of the books, so it might take a while before I can write it up properly.

In the meantime: I really liked it."
"1514","dont know why everyones trashing the new hellboy movie. if you read the comic it is a great adaptation. i mean how can you hate a movie that has lobster johnson. #HellboyMovie"
"1515","Hellboy wasn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Still pretty average."
"1516","worth seeing if you don't mind plenty of horror and gore."
"1517","The new Hellboy is not a good movie, but it is a fun movie."
"1518","Saw the John Wick 3 trailer today and it looks pretty good.
Best bit of the Hellboy showing tbh."
"1519","@Reece_Lively @Lionsgate I loved both of Del Toro's Hellboy films. And him not being involved is actually why I've been hesitate on going to see it. Also releasing this movie between Shazam and Avengers End Game is just bad business."
"1520","I bet one of these are a negative review"
"1521","@MonarchOfMemes If you read Hellboy, more specifically The Wild Hunt and Hellboy In Mexico, I feel like you’d appreciate it more. Also yeah, the Kickstart My Heart scene was fucking great."
"1522","@Reece_Lively So the critics were kind of right? They should've just let @RealGDT do a third Hellboy instead of rebooting for no reason."
"1523","Saw Hellboy. I have some thoughts."
"1524","Turns out the new Hellboy is as awful as it looked in the trailers."
"1525","i rate #hellboy 6.91 on the ajommuo index"
"1526","If you go to see #Hellboy this weekend just don’t expect it to be the same as the originals"
"1527","@MehTFIH Shame you're far, i need company to see Hellboy"
"1528","Congrats Millennium Films. You killed the appeal of Hellboy for any potential new fans and turned off the old ones."
"1529","#Hellboy bombed with a $4.93M first Friday opening. This is the lowest opening for a already low opening @HellboyMovie series. #BoxOffice"
"1530","Me: Time to watch #Hellboy!

Everyone: But I thought you weren't-

Me: The good one! It's on Netflix"
"1531","Hellboy was a good film, what’s with all the horrid reviews? These critics wanting every film to be the titanic. It’s very accurate to the comics as well and R rated <U+0001F481><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"1532","I saw two movies this year that reference King Arthur, and one of them was Hellboy(2019). Hollywood really likes King Arthur."

"1534","Tweet of the year."
"1535","U can’t out-monster GDT especially if ur not gonna make them horny"
"1536","@amzingfantasy @MonarchOfMemes i think if you've read Hellboy and thought the film was a good adaptation of the book then you're a crackhead who probably just loved the pretty pictures"
"1537","@WillamKelley @Reece_Lively @Lionsgate They really should’ve just gave him the 120 mil he needed for the third. Guaranteed it would’ve made more money due to good word of mouth and loyal fans of the property. The reboot needed to be great to justify its existence. Hopefully they pull a ghostbusters and make Hellboy 3"
"1538","So HELLBOY was not great. It was boring, which is kind of the worst thing it could have been. The tone was all over the place and aside from a couple of entertaining moments, it just kind of sat there and played monster frights. Not good."
"1539","@LittlestWinslow Cool! Going to see HELLBOY and the probably nap before I attempt to get some writing done <U+0001F600>"
"1540","@ERCboxoffice It was a big mistake to reboot it instead of making a Hellboy 3, with or without del Toro."
"1541","@ariakarii I am in a rather good mood right now. Just got home from seeing the new Hellboy film so that was fun.

I have my first ever band practise tomorrow, so that's exciting!"
"1542","@derO23 Good choice! I'm not much of a comic reader, but I really liked Hellboy and Plague of Frogs. A little on the fence regarding Hell on Earth (and haven't read The Devil You Know bc. I'm waiting for the omnibus edition)."
"1543","Everyone saying the new Hellboy sucks is probably right so I’m just going to watch OG Hellboy instead"
"1544","@perlmutations Mr Perlman, I just read that Hellboy has been recast. Not happy about that!  You are the only Hellboy in my humble opinion. Can’t imagine anyone else having the right amount of “snark” for that role."
"1545","i always get uncomfortable now when i look at hellboy bc im reminded of that time a hellboy cosplayer at a con asked to take a photo with me and without asking put his arm around me, a clearly underage girl in a psylocke costume (kris anka suit)"
"1546","It is not the worst comic book movie ever made. Not when Fan4stic, Hot Topic Squad, and Hellboy exist, but it is a mess."
"1547","@Coelasquid It was super awful lol, and they butchered Hellboys character just as badly  as the pearlman movies did just in different ways. I liked Kim though, and the medium girl. Probably the only valid things I enjoyed. The rest was just gratuitous gore which isnt the pointTM of hellboy"
"1548","@P_Dawg_ You probably could make a pretty good adaptation of Wild Hunt as a trilogy with the 1st film setting up Hellboy's origin, elements of The Corpse to introduce Gruagach, then the rest adapting the whole Arthur/Nimue story.  But idk how Diamio and Lobster John were even involved."
"1549","@IGN no @perlmutations no reason to go he is #Hellboy"
"1550","@Jeaniene_Frost Yeah it's not worth seeing and Perleman is the best Hellboy. This movie was a disjointed mess with a bad script, CGI and editing"
"1551","Went in with low expectations to see Hellboy. Those expectations was met... Wished Del Toro could have finished his trilogy with Ron Perleman."
"1552","@CJChamp16 Should I see it? I loved the older Hellboy movies"
"1553","hellboy incroyable"
"1554","Hellboy (2019) obviously can’t compare to the original, but I don’t think it should and it’s absolutely not the garbage people are calling it. It’s not AMAZING writing per se, but it’s more solid than you’d think. I’ve seen STRAIGHT garbage, this isn’t it. (1/3)"

"1561","People who take films like Hellboy seriously and can’t just have fun are so lame"
"1562","“Hellboy” wasn’t dreadful but it wasn’t good either.  It has a lot of ideas and concepts that just weren’t executed well."
"1563","At some strange level I am happy Hellboy is bombing and that is because I want Shazam! To take the box office for more weeks because I love it so much."
"1564","Hellboy was entertaining but I prefer the other two movies.  The effects were great."
"1565","@MANX38 I saw @HellboyMovie yesterday and liked it. It's very violent but never boring that's for sure. I never saw the original  ""Hellboy"" movie. I saw ""Hellboy 2"" only. This is a reboot of the series. @DavidKHarbour is really good in the role."
"1566","#Hellboy was a delight. I’ve only ever been exposed to the @RealGDT movies, I never read any of the comics, but I have to say that this movie certainly did justice to those first two films.
More blood and death and plenty of fucks so it urned it’s R rating but a fun romp."
"1567","Watching the first two ‘Hellboy’ films. The new one looks a right load of cobblers but one and two are ace."
"1568","At the movies about to see Hellboy. Oh boy."
"1569","Hellboy was pretty cool sad my dad ( @RealGDT ) wasn’t a part of it.. But I could def see how they covered his work."
"1570","Dear lord , that was a lot of horror ,blood , violence and ghor. Not what I thought it would be #Hellboy"
"1571","@ksfphd Hey, that looks great! The Art Of Hellboy is extremely hard to find these days."
"1572","While everyone else is talking about the new Hellboy movie, I keep reminiscing about Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Got to watch it with two of the most extraordinary people I ever had the pleasure of knowing."
"1573","Hellboy (2019) has some fun moments but is overall a massive unbelievable if good intentioned mess. Still a mess though. A huge one. Baba Yaga scene is fantastic and I love the final scene too. Admit that the stinger got me but zero chance this gets a sequel so whatever. 4/10"
"1574","Time to head off to #Cinebistro for #Hellboy"
"1575","Light dimming. Trailers starting. See you after the movie. #Hellboy"
"1576","Off to get a massage --because my back pain demands it-- and then pick up big sis to go see #Hellboy ... hoping the critics are wrong."
"1577","So #Hellboy wasn't TERRIBLE, but it wasn't great either. The movie was just too fast and lacked the charm that Del Toro and Perlman brought to the table. It's kinda like they tried to compensate for that with the hyper gore."
"1578","They just... Didn't spend ANY time developing character. Hellboy is just angry all the time and they don't delve into why in order to make us connect with him. We're supposed to just kinda get it and move on to the next gory moment."
"1579","@CharlesKhanTV I've only been reading the main Hellboy stuff in the omnibus but I want to grab the other books because I can see the gaps in extra stories and I want to know more."
"1580","You know what the Hellboy reboot SHOULD'VE been to differentiate from Del Toro? A groundbreaking, PG-13, CG animated movie using something similar to the Injustice 2 model. Could've had a lot more freedom to replicate Mignola's incredible visuals and pushed animation for adults."
"1581","Man, the more I think about it, the more I realize this Hellboy movie should've done all the Rasputin arc stuff up to the chained coffin arc.  could've put baba yaga and pigboy in the opening along with Hellboy's summoning and gone fully into fun shit while setting up wild hunt."
"1582","So I have some mixed feelings about Hellboy.
Most of the CGI was laughable, they threw together way too many elements and didnt fully develop a single character BUT the action and gore (while short in most parts) was pretty badass. I dont feel like I wasted my money tbh."
"1583","The original was perfect. Why y’all mess with it? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. #HellBoy"
"1584","Hellboy is an extremely accurate title because sitting through it gave me a taste of what eternal damnation must be like"
"1585","Watched #Hellboy  very good film,nice witty lines spectacular action set pieces,just needed a better climax it seemed hurried.@MillaJovovich #Davidharbour and @Sashalane were fantastic"
"1586","@joe_dante @perlmutations Must admit I will not see the new Hellboy. Yes @perlmutations was going to be replaced, we all are, but not yet! Hopefully true for me too. I will not wish him happy birthday 'cause... why would he care what I think?"
"1587","Recommend watching Hellboy <U+0001F44C>"
"1588","Bout to see #Hellboy always glad to see @MillaJovovich and @DavidKHarbour in anything, but especially cool genre stuff!"
"1589","Watched the new #Hellboy and while I won’t bash it, it did make me remember all the wonderful fantasy, heart and terrific performances that @RealGDT brought to the first two...Golden Army is still one of my favorite movies."
"1590","If you’re thinking about watching hellboy don’t waste of money I say there and fell asleep"
"1591","Hellboy was exactly what everyone has told me to expect. Slow and unfocused, exactly what they would have made in 2004 if Del Toro hadn't been involved. Including the crappy CG."
"1592","Now for Shazam. I swore off DC movies after Aquaman (which sucked, admit it) but this got good reviews and I have to make the most of my Unlimited card."
"1593","Hellboy also has a post credits scene.  Both mid and post credits set up possible sequels."
"1594","#Hellboy was okay.  Cool action scenes.  Plus, Milla Jovovich was great in the film"
"1595","I straight up just walked out of Hellboy. That shit is some ass."
"1596","@AliciaMarieBODY I haven't seen Captain Marvel, only seen Shazam so far and I want to see Hellboy <U+0001F62D>"
"1597","Saw the Hellboy reboot last night, I give it a solid 9/10; movie DEFINITELY did not deserve 15% on Rotten Tomatoes"
"1598","Didn't expect all that gore, but it was a great film. Budget can be seen from time to time but aside of that, everything was great. I can understand the 'hate' that due to the change of Hellboy actor and director, but it was a good film regardless."
"1599","Firing Del Toro and Perlmans Hellboy on just so I can fairly assess how badly the new effort is going to compare."
"1600","Haven’t seen the numbers. I wasn’t impressed with the trailers."
"1601","@CRIMS0NGUARDX Nothing unfortunately but I did see Hellboy and it was awesome"
"1602","Bout to see Hellboy because I understand who I am"
"1603","#Hellboy: One of the worst reboots I’ve ever seen. David Harbour’s performance turned the demon into a Chris Farley character. Skip this piece of trash and watch either the @RealGDT or animated films.

#HellboyMovie #Hellboy2019"
"1604","@middlebroiz Look man, I appreciate the effort and all that but this live tweet of #Hellboy is just fucking terrible."
"1605","Hellboy was very underwhelming but overall absolutely nowhere near as “the worst most awful movie ever” as everyone keeps making it out to be, it’s a comic movie, chill my dudes"
"1606","@pottermcu I’m so disappointed hellboy is literally part of my childhood...... maybe it’s time for hollywood to stop makes reboots and ruin our childhoods and actually come up with brand new ideas what about that"
"1607","i really want to see hellboy tonight"
"1608","Ben and I are about to watch hellboy in the imax recliners at the silverlink so the chances of me falling asleep are at a solid 40%"
"1609","@digitaldraco Yeah, it'd allow a basic level of competence and let people still specialize. The system allows also for ""weird"" PCs and stuff too, so wouldn't be hard to have people like Hellboy or Abe."
"1610","@digitaldraco It's FATE Core, but it does some things that would fit really well. Atomic Robo is a lot like Hellboy in terms of themes (just science instead of supernatural)"
"1611","Not gonna win father of the year in 2019. Do not take your kids to a Movie you did not check the rating. Hellboy is not a kid movie at all!! Entertaining sure, but earned the R rating from beginning to end. #nightmaresguarateed"
"1612","Quick thoughts on #Hellboy since I couldn’t do a review:

-Love how they leaned into the horror
-Fun action
-Enjoyable amount of gore
-Terribly unfunny
-Convoluted
-None or the characters are enjoyable
-Terrible CGI

Overall: 4 out of 10"
"1613","Might try to give Hellboy a re-read. I read the first volume of the omnibus earlier this year and it was real good but it didn't quite grab me? I love the art and overall style of it but something didn't tick...hopefully a 2nd go will sort it"
"1614","I enjoyed #Hellboy. There’s issues like every other movie, but it’s fun to finally see HB in an R-rated setting. I like a lot of the creature and set design a lot. David Harbour makes a great HB. I would like to see what can be done with a sequel."
"1615","Having said that. I’ve read about the troubles the production of #Hellboy had. IF there is a sequel (it’s a long shot) Marshall ain’t returning, and I’d be shocked if Harbour did. This kinda seems like a one and done. Perhaps HB just isn’t meant for the big screen."
"1616","Has anybody seen Hellboy? Is it really as bad as the reviews suggest?"
"1617","Missing Link is my last hope to see a good movie this weekend. Little, After, and Hellboy have made for one of the worst wide release weekends in some time."
"1618","@MrControversy83 Yeah but now you'll be forced to watch Hellboy."
"1619","The real Hellboy has snapped!"
"1620","Two more reasons why Hollywood pisses me off.

Pet Semetery remake

Hellboy remake"
"1621","There’s a lot of fanboys giving Hellboy terrible reviews.  I’ll be honest. I liked it.   It’s a reboot movie of a violent comic book so there’s violence.   I loved the original movies but this one fits into the mold in of modern movies.  And the originals, sadly no longer do."
"1622","#Hellboy could’ve added a bit more blood and gore, it was clearly lacking in that department <U+0001F61C>"
"1623","My friend and I are about to watch the new #Hellboy movie! <U+0001F60A>"
"1624","Just saw the new Hellboy.  Pretty good, worth seeing (especially since it doesn't have Ron Perlman).

All I'll say beyond that is that a lot of furries are going to want to travel to Belize after seeing it.  Especially @droppcat"
"1625","Dude. 

They put Mignola and Fegredo art on the BIG SCREEN. 

They took it out of the comics and made it larger than life. 

Do you even understand how COOL that is??

#Hellboy"
"1626","just been to see #Hellboy
Awful.
Just awful.

If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve seen the movie... there’s just more of it.  Plus some very very bad dialogue, very badly delivered.
No-one gives a good performance.  Milla Jovovic embarrassingly bad."
"1627","Hellboy is such a transparent attempt at Hollywood conditioning. ""Hey retar- I mean, hey America, what if the devil was actually the good guy? Wouldn't that be super cool!?"""
"1628","#Hellboy was SO BAD. Many points without resolution, no character development, no narative cohesion, badly shot edited, vocally synced and no charm. Truly went to Hell. So sad to see actors clearly not wanting to be there and a top practical effect team squandered on such a mess."
"1629","@WolfSamurai Oops. 

I really liked Hellboy as a Monster of the Week game. How would Atomic Robo handle it? (I'm not familiar with the game/rules.)"
"1630","I really wanna watch Hellboy"
"1631","so hellboy sucks unfortunately"
"1632","@CthulhusProdigy @MTFIII But you are going to see Hellboy?"
"1633","@CthulhusProdigy @MTFIII Hellboy deserves all the flames you tried to give Carol who soared past a Bil... Hellboy looking like its going to do Robin Hood 2018 numbers..."
"1634","@landofthe80 @perlmutations Funny watched the new #Hellboy today, hmm"
"1635","@FreddyInSpace I think most horror fans like myself couldn't get over the fact that this was not the Del Toro Hellboy we wanted. I think Neil Marshall is a fabulous director and love his movies but have no desire to see this movie."
"1636","About to watch Hellboy...I bet not be disappointed man."
"1637","I enjoyed Hellboy. Of coarse it don’t even compare to the others w my baby Ron Pearlman...but it’s cool <U+0001F60E>"
"1638","I keep seeing these horrible reviews for the new Hellboy and it’s got me a little nervous. Not gonna lie."
"1639","@MrS_Primary couldn't tag you in the actual image mate, so here is your tag. :P"
"1640","@perlmutations You are the one and only Hellboy in my heart Ron<U+2764><U+0001F48B><U+0001F609><U+0001F609>"
"1641","The new Hellboy isn't too bad. It moves really fast as they try to cover a lot of plot in its run time, and some of the CG and greenscreen is pretty bad, but it's still a fun movie most of the time."
"1642","@GenkiJAM Everything I saw in the trailer kind of made it look like an Avengers-type movie. Hellboy is supposed to be quiet and moody, not loud and set in a bunch of cities for some reason"
"1643","So I was out of town the last two days, so I’ll be doing the @AMCTheatres double header tomorrow. #MissingLink #HellBoy"
"1644","Can we pretend the new Hellboy never happened and give @RealGDT what ever he wants to make the next one... please"
"1645","@DavidKHarbour The critics trashed it, but I loved hellboy and your performance. We need more movies like this."
"1646","Matching couple shirts???? We stan."
"1647","@MartyLight Your saving grace, mayhap?"

"1649","Sudden reminder that the new Hellboy is absolutely awful"
"1650","If you go see Hellboy 2019, it’s just as bad as supporting one of the videos by @_Hero_Hei_. Which is why I refuse to damage my braincells on either"
"1651","@EuronymooseLive That's a shame I used to love Hellboy."
"1652","@lagoon83 Just drop a copy of Hellboy on your head to put yourself out of any misery."
"1653","@RealGDT The one and only Hellboy, it seems"
"1654","@RealGDT The real Hellboy"
"1655","so, #ChrisDavis finally had 2 hits and 4 rbis for #Orioles today .. he certainly had a much better day than I did watching the flaming pile of excrement that is the new #Hellboy movie"
"1656","@RealGDT The best hellboy in the world!!!"
"1657","Hellboy hot take: It tried really hard, but bit off way more than it could chew. Scenes were disjointed. The pacing was weird. It either needed more or less plot. It felt like a full story kept getting trimmed to cram in more fight scenes. C"
"1658","Happy Birthday to the ever incredible Ron Perlman his Hellboy films were a major part of my childhood and the narration he did for the fallout series will forever be the pinnacle of game narration"
"1659","Personally, I enjoyed #Hellboy ; As an average, everyday cinema-goer I thought it to be of solid quality, but I haven't read any of the comics, so I won't try to argue with anyone saying it was inaccurate to the story, or trying to shove too many stories together."
"1660","So... like it’s definitely a movie you have to be in a mood for but if you are in that mood it’s a blast. Don’t let all the reviews turn you away if you think you’d be into it."
"1661","Movie hopping from hellboy to best of frenemies"
"1662","Ouch. Seeing a LOT of hate for Hellboy when I liked it enough to see it twice. Might even go see it a third time to bridge the gap between End Game and the start of the May movie rush."
"1663","At the theater for Missing Link and Hellboy."
"1664","With 10000% sincerity, #hellboy was really fucking good or at least a great deal of fun, whose greatest sin is that it’s an actual horror comic movie and not something Disney adorkably focused grouped to death."
"1665","#Hellboy was pretty entertaining and the Gore/Blood is a nice touch but i feel it was kinda rushed in some scenes too much happening O.o still kinda prefer the old Hellboy tho :P"
"1666","Just went to see the new Hellboy and there’s a pig-headed (literally) demon with a Scouse accent who calls a monk a “gobshite”."
"1667","one of the best things abt being friends with claire is that she runs a your fave gets pegged blog so sometimes i'll get a text like ""does hellboy get pegged"" out of nowhere"
"1668","@ZacharyLevi, I've seen Captain Marvel yesterday, Shazam today and Hellboy will be watched tomorrow. What a time to be alive!
You're effing awesome in the movie and (from what I've seen on Twitter) a pretty awesome dude outside of it, too. Keep on keeping on!"

"1671","So Hellboy sucked? Must be because Guillermo del Toro wasn’t directing it this time. I still wanna see it though"
"1672","This human being knows how the character Hellboy works. Happy Birthday!"
"1673","@kolbytoldme Seriously! I think Alice was meant to give that but she turns up way too late and has no chemistry with Hellboy to suggest she’s known him all her life. And I noticed that on this rewatch, the Red/Blue back and forth with Abe is so small but vital to understand their relationship"
"1674","Barely 15 minutes into a long overdue rewatch of del Toro’s Hellboy II and it already has 100x more charm than the whole of the reboot."
"1675","@AdrianR0binson I liked one of them alot, but was pretty bored with the others. Still Perlman's voice is perfect, hope they think of him if any new animated #Hellboy stuff comes up in the future. The guy is already a voice actor"
"1676","Cleared my schedule next week to see Hellboy a few times. No spoilers please."
"1677","@x6x_batman_no3 I’ve had two rounds of Shazam and adore it (hopefully international markets give it a bigger box office) I’m seeing Hellboy for shits and giggles tomorrow"
"1678","@THR It's hard to have box office success when your scores is lower than 20%. Doesn't help that this movie is coming out between two much more anticipated and larger budget superhero films, Shazam! and Endgame. And that Hellboy movies have never been great box officer performers."
"1679","The new Hellboy is the Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man version of Hellboy. It's the original movie with imposter syndrome. It's biggest mount to climb was not coming first. But even then it would have just been a simple ""ok"""
"1680","#HellboyMovie #Hellboy Exceptionally bad film! Worst I have seen in a long time! Bad acting, mediocre effects and poorly told storyline. Scouser pig-man, Irish Merlin, Americans trying to do English accents and a house on bird-legs - just bad! Don’t waste your money!"
"1681","Went to go see Hellboy

End up getting sick because of a jackass vaping a row and two seats down from me."
"1682","DO NOT take your children to see Hellboy. This isn’t the comic-like del Toro movies. This movie is a hard R and isn’t for kids. 

It’s great though. DO GO SEE IT, just not with your kids. #Hellboy"

"1684","It’s only a matter of time before I fall asleep in my chair and miss the time to see Hellboy"
"1685","@RealGDT nothing but respect for My Hellboy."
"1686","If you liked the original Hellboy, or even if you didn’t, I can’t really recommend the new one. Sure there’s swearing but it doesn’t exactly make it better. <U+0001F44E>"
"1687","@newbeverly As we have seen; the one &amp; only Hellboy."
"1688","Don't listen to the critics: The new Hellboy is fantastic, IMO! @DavidKHarbour-fantastic performance as Hellboy, @MillaJovovich-Nimue rocks! @SashaBianca23-Alice is such a badass-in many ways, she could be the biggest overall hero of the movie! Dark, gritty, intense, awesome!"
"1689","@FilmInquiry Hellboy, Sons of Anarchy, Beauty and the Beast and The Name of the Rose"
"1690","@TheChewDefense I saw Hellboy 1 in theaters but was either drunk or tired and slept through it. Biggest thing I remember about Hellboy 2 The Golden Army 1 was like RIGHT at the climax some dudes watch alarm went off and he decided we should all hear it through the end."
"1691","@PNemiroff Hi Perri.  I get the feeling Hellboy is going to tank even harder than a lot are expecting.  I'm planning to see it tonight @ 10 in IMAX and right now I have the theatre all to myself.  Yesterday's IMAX had just 5 people at the 10 o'clock showing."
"1692","Happy Birthday!!!!@perlmutations"

"1694","After seeing Hellboy at a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes I was saddened, but after reading the reviews (positive and negative) Its seems like my jam. Most complaints being on gore and wanting a 3rd Del Toro film. With expectations to have a rushed backstory thrown jt me, I'm set to watch"
"1695","Well......I’m about to see #Hellboy. Hopefully I’ll come out of this one alive."
"1696","Here’s some advice for those planning on going to the theaters to see a movie this weekend. Go see #MissingLink instead of #Hellboy! Trust me! It deserves your money a whole lot more!"
"1697","#Hellboy is one of the worst superhero movies I’ve ever seen! Nothing but pure fucking garbage! The characters are cartoons, the CGI was awful, the humor was pathetic, and it’s full of over the top cartoony violence that’s just there for the sake of being there. Absolute trash!"

"1716","@mattlumpkin I held out scant hope, but the new HELLBOY is bad. Don't waste your money or time. (FTR, I don't love the del Toro HELLSBOY, but for fan reasons, not because they aren't worthwhile movies. GDT and I just like different things about HELLBOY.)"
"1717","Happy birthday to the best Hellboy @perlmutations"
"1718","@FreddyInSpace The biggest problem with Hellboy is that his comic is very niche and so is his appeal. It's something that even plagued Del Toro's films as well. Hellboy is just not a property that was going to rake in big $ even if everyone loved this new one."
"1719","It has a poor rating but those are just haters take my word for it"
"1720","HellBoy was maaaaaaaad. Everyone needs to see it. The two previous films can’t even come near!!!!!"
"1721","Actually really enjoyed #Hellboy earlier"
"1722","@DavidKHarbour Absolutely loved this movie and especially you as Hellboy! Definitely seeing this movie again before it leaves theaters."
"1723","@perlmutations Ron is the Original Hellboy. The title can never be claimed by another. As surely as Adam West is Batman and Arnold is Conan and Wesley is Blade."
"1724","#Hellboy it looks like Hellboy isn't getting good reviews at all, they are saying it's not the same movie Guillermo del Toro gave us years ago. I guess I'll have to see for myself, but I don't want to waste money going to watch this if it's not going to be very good."
"1725","#Hellboy I'm going to see hell boy tonight, probably around 8pm. I've seen all of the other Hellboy movies before, but this one looks different and seems to have a lot more action. I'll give my review after.<U+0001F44D>"

"1729","@Reece_Lively I still love Hellboy they give tropes and more homage to the short stories and monsters look exactly like Mignola creatures design from his comics"
"1730","Hell boy wasn't a bad movie. Just very jarring to watch. If you saw the previous hellboy movies. You won't love this reboot. It's a step down. 

Editing wasn't great and music choices were off. 

All in all they should have just given the old Hellboy his 3rd movie."
"1731","Saw #US and #Hellboy last night, one is awesome and the other is complete garbage, garbage smells which rhymes with hell. Well done @JordanPeele, movie rocked, and made me think again watching horror movies"
"1732","Not surprising. Marketing was crap. General audience don't know if it's a sequel or reboot, it's R rated, and people already spent their movie money on Shazam and US.  And let's be real, #Hellboy wasn't ever popular enough for this."
"1733","Just wait to download hellboy and watch it in your house. No need to waste money"
"1734","Hellboy: Not as bad as the scores suggest, but has it's fair share of issues.

It suffers from and throwing up references to the comics with absolutely no explanation to who or what they are, which is just going to utterly baffle audiences not familiar with the material."
"1735","I absolutely hate the new #Hellboy  movie. Hellboy ain’t hellboy. You can’t do any hellboy movies without Ron #wewanthellboyback #therealhellboy"
"1736","Fuck the haters and reviews the @HellboyMovie was fucking amazing! There was so much history and lore they packed into it I thought my brain was going to explode! They made me want to go back and re-read all of my Hellboy and BPRD issues. I really hope they make more! <U+0001F92F><U+0001F92F><U+0001F92F><U+0001F608><U+0001F608>"

And I saw the theatrical production of Flashdance.

Don't bother, folks, save your money."
"1738","I'm sorry. I just can't bring myself to watch the new Hellboy. Nothing against the cast or crew. It's just the entire time I'd be sitting there thinking ""they could/should have used this money for Guillermo del Toro to finish his Hellboy trilogy""."

"1743","in like 2012 I went on a huge hellboy binge and read all of it up to I think wild hunt? around there, and read all of the BPRD plague of frogs saga. got big fancy omnibus editions and everything, I just absolutely fell in love with all of it"
"1744","for real though do any of y’all read hellboy or BPRD or am I just alone in my endless gushing about these comics"
"1745","@RealGDT Maybe it’s not the right way to have it proven but he’s still the one and only actor born to play #Hellboy"
"1746","New #Hellboy was good fun and filled with Inspiration for #DnD It does have a few misteps with pacing, unnecessary flashbacks and jokes that fall flat occasionally. But the cast was great, with phenomenal monster design and fun if overedited action sequences. It gets a solid B-."
"1747","@perlmutations So you are cool with war crimes right? Sounds good okay we see what kind of garbage person you are. Which is why they passed on ahead been like you for the new hellboy."

"1753","Man, the new Hellboy is getting EVISCERATED.  This looks like an avoid-at-all-costs movie."
"1754","So yeah.. that was pretty bad. A lot of the CG felt either unfinished or they didn’t have the $ to go all out.  

So if there is a positive, GDT bailing (or not being allowed to do a 3rd) got him an Oscar #Hellboy"
"1755","That Ogre fight in Hellboy 2019 was very cool and well done, it's a faux one-take but it's so energetic and by the end you feel like you just fought a bunch of ogres too."
"1756","Just saw the new #Hellboy can’t help but miss @perlmutations as Hellboy."
"1757","The new hellboy movie sucked ass"
"1758","@mexopolis @perlmutations Best hellboy, period."
"1759","I will not be watching the new Hellboy movie. Partly out of solidarity with Guillermo Del Toro, and partly because it looks terrible."
"1760","I've been bowled over by the support guys - thank you all so much.

Although things are very hard just now, a real major positive in my life is just how wonderful my friends and family are.

Today I caught up with @JiiDee (seeing Hellboy), and a relative. Made a huge difference."

"1765","That was hard to watch. Nothing against the actors. The script was wank and the cgi was painful. But the make up was great and had a good soundtrack. Apart from that. It wasn’t good. I’m going back to 2004 #Hellboy #Hellboy2019"

"1769","Hellboy was a blast. It may  not have been Neil Marshall’s full vision but it wasn’t any less entertaining. A pretty nice adaptation of Mignola’s art and mythology. Cast made it a lot of fun. Gory as hell too."

"1776","@perlmutations I just found out you're not in Hellboy"
"1777","Hellboy's amazing, honestly. Perlman was good and set a precedent; I enjoyed them... but Harbour... such a terrific portrayal. He IS Hellboy."
"1778","Hellboy is an interesting movie"
"1779","@TheChewDefense I think that might have to do with the fact that no one else but Perlman has played Hellboy up to this point so you're automatically comparing the two. I thought he did a good job."
"1780","@TheKennyJohnson @perlmutations Give me Hellboy 3 with Del Toro!!"
"1781","Looking at weekend boxoffice, the “‘Hellboy’ goes down in flames” headlines do pretty much write themselves."

Finally a hard R in all it gory glory . New Hellboy is more like the comics . The S/E are great . The story ok , acting is good .The fighting scenes  are the star of show
Bad  the story jumps around a lot 
3-1/2 out 5 stars . It very much gory monster bash"
"1790","if hellboy were a tv series i would Definitely Want &amp; Trust the doom patrol writers for it. they embrace the weirdness &amp; fantastical elements of the DP and proven that they handle the characters and their relationships with care."
"1791","&amp; to go along with my ""pitch"" of each hellboy episode being a separate but loosely connected adventure, each doom patrol episode is somewhat standalone while still v much focused on the char's and the big bad mr negative looming over the season."
"1792","honestly? hellboy (2019) would've been better if it was a netflix show. i appreciate the homages to the comic but the source material is what ultimately held this back bc each volume/TPB was just one story arc or collection of short stories. so it was a challenge already to 1/"
"1793","3/ and like i get some are vehemently defending it as closer to the comic, but MILD SPOILER 

bruttenholm raising hellboy like a weapon ? he raised that kid as a kid, giving him lobster johnson comix &amp; pancakes so the essence of their familial relationship was muddled already"

"1798","@Dham0624 Hellboy shouldn’t have been remade, so many other comics that could’ve been told."
"1799","@FreddyInSpace Not sure. Hellboy made the same mistakes that DC movies make. They cast the movie wonderfully, had wicked effects, but tries to cram a billion differet stories all into 2 hours.  There are some important backstories that they just gloss over."
"1800","@perlmutations There is only one Hellboy and I think today's his birthday. Happy happy, and may there be many more! <U+0001F382>"
"1801","...It´s everything else than dark or darker in relation to the first two Hellboy movies, it´s a joke. The #GuillermoDelToro &amp; @perlmutations movies also had humour but they also had a quantum of seriousness and thrill and wonderful horror &amp; fantasy elements. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
"1802","The only thing good about #Hellboy 2019 was David Harbour and the look of some of the creepy ass creatures.  The movie lacks the love and charm that Guillermo Del Toro poured into the original films."
"1803","Happy Birthday, @perlmutations !"
"1804","@has_bookpushers I loved Perlman's portrayal of Hellboy so much, I refused to see the remake. From the reviews I've read, yours included, I don't regret that choice."

for the new Hellboy.
Then sleep for 10 hrs.

Sounds about right."
"1808","@HellboyMovie without @perlmutations  #guillermodeltoro not worth seeing -You have a dead flick- sad to see you’re ruining a superb legacy - btw the trailer is shit - without Ron you gave No #Hellboy respect to @perlmutations"

"1811","Loved #hellboy - not sure what is happening with critics these days. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish!"
"1812","@JetplaneJAY Always good to read reviews from fans when it comes to these movies. True to the comics. The first hellboy series with Ron Perlman were good but wasn’t true to the comics. Go into this with an open mind and you’ll enjoy it as a popcorn flick."

"1820","@Bosco685 @Gedaffa_Koff Yeah that odd animation at the start kind of reminded me of the art in the story at the start of Watership Down a childhood favorite of mine! Yeah Hellboy 2 really checked ever box for me and is utterly magnificent and wonderful"
"1821","@PamRobins3 @hellboy_news They all wanted a third Del Toro movie, and were going to shit on anything that wasn't that! Give this movie a few years it will become a huge cult classic once that fans of Hellboy comics finally give a chance! I agree I don't see anyone could call the movie unwatchable"
"1822","@Bosco685 @Gedaffa_Koff I agree I will admit there was way too much cussing and as much as I absolutely loved the gore Hellboy doesn't need it, I guess when my mind goes to ""family friendly I imagine Disney cartoons, but I can still see the GDT movies freaking some kids out his creature designed"
"1823","@Bosco685 @Gedaffa_Koff Oh yes I love both GDT Hellboy movies, I just the golden army was a legit beautiful movie, had one of the best and most sympathetic villains ever plus when Abe and Hellboy got drunk together and sang I can't smile with out you was classic don't think anything will top it"
"1824","@Bosco685 @Gedaffa_Koff Well one would gander to guess that a movie called ""Hellboy"" isn't really something geared towards a family night out! I'm not bashing on hypothetical families here I'm talking about people I've actually spoken to on the topic and my take away from what they said"
"1825","@Bosco685 @Gedaffa_Koff Hellboy 2 the Golden Army is my all-time favorite comic book movie, trust me man I'm still bummed out like everyone else we didn't get a 3rd GDT movie, but on the other hand I'm happy with the new film it's not as good as HB2 but it's nowinear as bad as the media are making it"

"1831","Happy Birthday Hellboy I mean @perlmutations  Whether you're Clayface Hellboy you're always awesome and a nice guy also"
"1832","In the best timeline the new #Hellboy movie was directed by Sam Raimi and starred Bruce Cambell"
"1833","Well don’t you fuckers wish you kept @perlmutations and @RealGDT  now? You should’ve never messed with it. There was no expectations for this because no one asked for it. We LOVED what we had &amp; you didn’t want to give money to art &amp; artists.  #Hellboy"
"1834","@perlmutations Jesus that new Hellboy is total crap my friend. Your amazing acting talent was missed dearly. Hell we had 8 people total in the theater compared to when you were in the last one where it was sold out! #TheirLoss #2019DumbMistake #Theresonly1Hellboy 1<U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"1835","@Dyslogix @perlmutations There is a new hellboy movie? Wow I didn't know that. I guess all studios make mistakes sometime."
"1836","I actually enjoyed #Hellboy. It’s not a good film, but it’s not terrible either."
"1837","Here's a Hellboy review for you: really just boring overall. Nothing has weight in it, action or character or plot. Some it is mildly amusing but it doesn't even get laughably bad."
"1838","If you don’t see hellboy you’re officially not cool - signed and co-signed by Felf"
"1839","@perlmutations Happy Birthday!! Love your work. Beauty and the Best, Hellboy, SoA. I still watch all of them to this day. Thank you for your genius and creativity. Hope you have a badass day!"

"1842","This movie bases the entire ""Snap out of it!"" moment in the climax around someone calling Hellboy a ""whiny bitch""
Even if we didn't have the heart and warmth of the GDT movies to compare it to, that would be an atrocious choice"
"1843","I hate the new Hellboy more every second I spend thinking about it"
"1844","So the new Hellboy is a festering pile of bad editing, stilted expository dialogue, blatant ADR inserted jokes and a total disregard for proper pacing
And that's before you pile on the current of toxic masculinity that runs under the entire enterprise"
"1845","And all that talk of being ""more accurate to the comics"" gets reduced down to namedrops, an extended Lobster Johnson cameo and a couple visual references to various Hellboy storylines thrown in with no thought or reason for their inclusion"

"1848","#Hellboy is sooo much better than I've been reading about. It's got wit and zest and #DavidHarbour.  There's one FANTASTIC scene that could have been in the best #GameofThrones episodes.  The director Neil Marshall has been one of my faves since #TheDescent."

"1856","@GenkiJAM Thats about where I quit reading. Hellboy had the sword and hells army, Abe had the frog army, and Liz had the yeti army. 

I’m betting they all got into confict, then some bigger enemy appeared uniting them."
"1857","@GenkiJAM I also found all the other spinoffs and midquels that filled in different backstories kind of distracting, like thw witch hunter or young hellboy stuff that was out. 

I’m curious to see how they died up those armies being readied for a conflict."

"1859","Well, Hellboy sucked. Bad acting. Bad effects. The story is a mess. Such a shame."
"1860","Just finished #Hellboy look for my #YSIB video review in the coming days!

First impression: some creative monster designs and over-the-top kills don't excuse incomprehensible story and frenetic action that's still somehow boring."
"1861","@RealGDT How could you even give them a chance of thinking of re-making Hellboy!?"
"1862","I quite enjoyed #Hellboy it’s not a perfect movie. But it’s fun, it has its issues. But doesn’t every film. @DavidKHarbour is very worthy to wear the horns. I quite hope he gets the chance to expand his portrayal."
"1863","The new Hellboy movie baffles me. 

So much going on, and so little of it interesting.

A wasted opportunity. 

Shazam, on the other hand, was a delight."
"1864","Gothic.

Sombre.

Unsettling.

Philosophical.

Spiritual.

Bittersweet.

When the next Hellboy reboot rolls around (and I think it will), these traits should be front and centre. The punching is secondary to a good Hellboy yarn."
"1865","lol remember when they made a new Hellboy movie."
"1866","The Hellboy makeup looked weird. The monster designs were really uninspired, and the cgi really stood out in a bad way. The score and the needle drops were overbearing"
"1867","Swing an a miss for that new Hellboy film. Even with the inclusion of Lobster Johnson."
"1868","@Decoder_Ring In other comic adaptation news, the young lady from the Hellboy trailer has what looks suspiciously like anti-magic brass knuckles."
"1869","I don’t get the #Hellboy hate.  Sure, it’s a mess, but a fun and entertaining mess.  Tonally, it’s completely different from GDT’s films, which is a good thing.  It’s like this Hellboy’s dulled horns-rough around the edges and imperfect."
"1870","#hellboy is one hell film to watch  <U+0001F623> I would prefer to continue 2004 version...it was really good !! This hellboy is all messed up. #Neil Marshall"

"1890","Somewhere there probably exists a three hour directors cut of #Hellboy that is quite entertaining. We sure didn’t get it tho. I don’t know who is responsible for this mess, but I can only assume it’s a teenager because it’s juvenile as fuck."
"1891","Mind you, this was during the trailers before watching #Hellboy which is made by Millenium Media which is run by a straight up sexual predator. My friend knew none of that at all. He only knew that somehow someway a bunch of women online forced Luc Besson to make a silly movie."

"1914","#HellboyMovie #Hellboy It's a bit strange and takes a while to get going. There are some slick fight scenes &amp; smooth effects. Strong performances from Harbour &amp; Jovovich. I'm sure there's plenty of attempts to stick to source material but I'm not convinced in it's success. 7/10<U+0001F3AC>"
"1915","@perlmutations I just love how you're able to portray such badasses, like Hellboy and Clay...

And yet somehow give them incredible depth and nuances. It's not ""just"" strong man solves problems with violence. It's ""strong"" man uses what he knows, to try and make sense of the world.
... I think."
"1916","Looking at the expected opening numbers for the Hellboy reboot, why didn't the studio have more faith in allowing Guillermo del Toro to close his trilogy? #Hellboy #HellboyMovie"
"1917","Just been to watch #HellBoy if you go to watch it as a critic don't bother. But if you go for a laugh you'll like it. Pissed myself laughing at Stephen Graham doing voice over. Calling a bunch of witches slags and gobshites <U+0001F602>"
"1918","Hellboy seemed like all fan service with little substance to back it up. Wasn't ""bad"" but it did a good job separating itself from the previous."

But the practical effects are fucking phenomenal and a scene in the middle of the movie between Hellboy and a which was actually really great. Overall it was"
"1922","@TheKennyJohnson @perlmutations Hellboy forever!!"
"1923","@rebeccarose937 Which one? You know that there is a lot of them. As for me I’m gonna be heading out soon, going to watch the new Hellboy."

"1926","Right, saw Hellboy. Besides some  hokey special effects and a very fast pace, I thought it was a great flick. It nailed the tone of a decent hellboy book and I had a load of fun watching it. I don't know why it's getting such horrible reviews, this is one you've to see."
"1927","@wishuponavlog87 Well there is always the hope for the next reboot of Hellboy to be better."
"1928","Really enjoyed this interview,Wow !"

"1936","@Dyslogix @perlmutations Pretty sure Ron already did the original Hellboy movies and didnt need to repeat in this cheesy remake....lol"
"1937","@FreddyInSpace The new Hellboy is absolutely trash. Nothing is fun. Of course, that’s my opinion, and I’m glad that there are people who are enjoying it. I’d rather it be a bad (IMO) movie that makes some people happy than a bad movie that no one likes."
"1938","Hellboy was a little cheezy and gory for the sake of being gory, but I really liked it.  Plus it had best boy in it.  @DrChunkyChief and @The1UPCUP know who im talking about.  Wink"
"1939","@CosmicBaconArt Yeah that's how I feel. Honestly terrible CGI, but that aside and it was a great Hellboy movie. Hope the bad reviews don't prevent an improved sequel from happening because I want more Lobster and more David Harbour Hellboy and more post credit scene thing that I won't spoil."

"1947","@hankgrossenart Hmmmmm. Not really... I wouldn’t say it’s Mignolas Hellboy on screen. Just a more violent and over the top version than we had before."

"1950","@perlmutations And I am so happy your lame-ass is not in the new Hellboy movie you stupid sucker"
"1951","I'd say if you enjoy the comics you should go see it, it has stuff from Hellboy in Mexico, The Wild Hunt, Box of Evil, The Storm and the Fury. Plus Lobster Johnson is in it. And the mid credits scene is probably the best thing in the movie"
"1952","Also David Harbour did a wonderful job as Hellboy. I just wish that the dialogue wasn't so shitty and they tried to make Hellboy a goof boy"
"1953","Meant to say they I wish they didn't make Hellboy a goof boy"
"1954","I saw Hellboy, it's kinda shit but it's not as shit as people are trying to make it out to be. I had a better time watching this than I did watching Pet Sematary and Dark Tower. Maybe it's just cuz I'm a Hellboy fanboy that I don't think it's the spawn of Satan (joke intended)"
"1955","Hellboy is king Arthur’s descendent. Huh? Also here’s Merlin long enough for you to strain yourself trying to figure out who’s playing him and then he dies because he spends all his magic summoning a sword from a few miles away. I could have summoned it with an Uber and $10"

"1963","@perlmutations Good day. Should you happen to see my old friend Hellboy in your travels, would you please tell him he's dearly missed by my family. We speak of him often and although we may never see them again, hope he and Liz are safe and well. xo"

"1967","I ended up choosing Hellboy. And it was pretty fun and the action was good... Except I thought Milla Jovovich didn't even try to act. At all. I don't expect even close to Oscar caliber performances in action flicks. But I'm not sure if she even bothered trying."
"1968","The new Hellboy is utter trash

This is when sometimes it ok to stream stuff rather hit the movies. Cause if i was watching it home, i honestly would have turn it off 20 min in"

"1973","[non spoiler]

In the first 10 minutes of HELLBOY someone has a speakerphone conversation with another character, but the entire scene happens while the camera is focus on an iPhone that has not yet been answered.

It’s a small oversight that sets the tone for everything else"

"1976","@deathjawinc @HellboyMovie Nah. Saw both. This Hellboy was trash. Only cool thing was the girl punching the ghost out of mofos."
"1977","@arianaxebel @HellboyMovie Yeah Hellboy was trash. Shazam was good because there were no expectations. Just found out that Black Atom will now come and tie them together"
"1978","Back from the new Hellboy. Not sure why some reviewers have a problem with it. Fine movie although the giant fight scene was a bit dizzying. Mid and post credit scenes very nice."
"1979","Weird moment today where we'd booked tickets for Wild Rose days ago only to find our seats didn't exist anymore. The screen had been moved (cuz Hellboy has proven more popular than expected, would you believe) but tickets weren't directly translatable. First time that's happened."

"1985","I thought #Hellboy was fine. Effects weren’t great and the dialogue was lacking. It didn’t break any ground but it wasn’t bad, per se and there were some fun moments. I’d have liked to see the movie it turned into in the last 5 minutes more than what we got, though."
"1986","The new Hellboy movie was entertaining. Not as good as the Guillermo Del Toro films or the comics but fun nonetheless. Was worth it for Lobster Johnson and the Spanish version of “Rock You Like A Hurricane”. #Hellboy"
"1987","Im about to watch hellboy and lowkey im hyped"
"1988","@cryptic_comics No. I wanted a follow up to Hellboy II: The Golden Army, not this."
"1989","@DarkHorseComics @Lionsgate @HellboyMovie Hellboy’s great. Don’t know what these so called critics were watching, but they clearly were not watching the same movie I just saw. There was gore, but not how the critics described. You know, it is rated R. There was a story, but the critics implied not-Why r they saying this?"
"1990","@DavidKHarbour @artofmmignola @danieldaekim @SashaBianca23 @MillaJovovich Best way to spend day off; saw Hellboy. I’m not a tomato person, I’m just me-but here is my review-Story moved quickly-I never found it hard to follow. Chemistry among the characters were amazing. 2/3"
"1991","@HellboyMovie @acmilan Absolutely loved the movie. Critics are way off. That’s why I hate reviews. They are just too subjective &amp; not based on anything concrete. They’ve been horrible to Hellboy &amp; the actors who worked so hard to make this movie. I saw all the hard work &amp; felt it in their performance<U+0001F44F>"
"1992","@DavidKHarbour @artofmmignola @danieldaekim @SashaBianca23 @MillaJovovich The story, pace, action, violence, gore &amp; humor was so well balanced-More balanced than I expected. David Harbour you were a great Hellboy. I really LOVED it. The movie is sure worth giving it a chance. 3/3"
"1993","@clownstench @hellboy_news Loved Hellboy too. Critics didn’t see the same movie I did, because they implied it was all gore, no story &amp; too choppy. There was gore but not the whole movie, there was a story to follow &amp; the movie flowed well. I never felt bored. I felt glued to the screen. Screw the reviews"
"1994","@hellboy_news Think there’s something wrong with the tomato meter. A 12%-really?Think it’s time they considered pooling some money together &amp; get a new meter because clearly there is something wrong with the one they have. Hellboy was so much better than how some described it. So worth seeing."
"1995","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Hellboy’s great. Don’t know what these so called critics were watching, but they clearly were not watching the same movie I just saw. There was gore, but not how the critics described. You know, it is rated R. There was a story, but the critics implied not-Why r they saying this?"
"1996","@perlmutations
The new hellboy has big shoes to fill. He'll never be as good as you, but i hope he does well."

"1998","If they released Hellboy in January like was originally planned it would have easily made a profit"
"1999","@IGN Hellboy is all about gore and nothing else"
"2000","I'm a Guillermo del Toro fan but not an obsessive fanboy. Thus I was able to enjoy the new #Hellboy for what it is. It's bloody, it's crazy, there's humour and action and oh yeah did I mention it's super fucking bloody. But most importantly it's FUN!"
"2001","This didn’t age well at ALL."
"2002","Hellboy reminded me of an old 80s era monster movie. It’s terrible and great. Funny. Reminds me of The Labyrinth a lot. I liked it."
"2003","Your great in the new hellboy!! @MillaJovovich"
"2004","Happy Birthday to the supreme chad Hellboy @perlmutations #Hellboy"
"2005","I wish David Harbour the best. But Ron Perlman cannot be beat as Hellboy. Harbour looks like a gut in prosthetics. Perlman looked like Hellboy — like he went to a tanning bed pull put on mthe finishing touches."
"2006","Hellboy loves sweets, hates nazis, shoots things, probably a massive stan of something, has a giant fucking stone arm, etc.
This is why we all need to stan him."
"2007","So in the same night we have had Hellboy (cause I said so) and Jeremy say gay rights."
"2008","@ERodBuster1 Such a shame this is basically turning into what’d happen if you mixed the SPAWN movie with Fant4stic.  Hellboy deserves so much better, especially after the terrific work Ron Perlman did in other other 2 movies."
"2009","So I decided to waste time watching #HellBoy and as I expected it’s a load of tosh <U+0001F612>"

"2013","@perlmutations Happy birthday to the real hellboy"
"2014","We're watching Hellboy 2 tonight as a much needed palette cleanser. Good lord, I love how pretty this movie is."
"2015","Saw Hellboy, it was about as good as the first one when Ron Perlman fanboyism is removed and nostalgia glasses are taken off. Keep in mind the first Hellboy movie was not amazing but it was fun. This is the same thing."
"2016","Awesome movies that bloggers tried to discreddit before they had a chance to prove their worth, because they didn't have the mouse's logo: Batman v Superman, Venom, Alita: Battle Angel, Aquaman, Glass, Hellboy (2019), The Accountant, Live by Night, etc."
"2017","Hellboy is relatable because he loves cats and pancakes."
"2018","I'm watching the good Hellboy on Netflix (for the I don't know-th time), and immediately this movie is so much better than the new one."

"2032","@FreddyInSpace Dude! I am pretty hard to please with film and I enjoyed BOTH of these movies! I wasn’t even expecting to like Hellboy. But it was just fun. People are literally backwards now.

But as far as the character of Hellboy goes, he did a great job and maybe even had the characterization down a bit better (if not the same quality)."

HELLBOY (2019)

I exited this movie 15 min ago, and aside from the gruesomeness of the kills (pretty rad!), I can't remember a damn thing about it. It's like it never happened, but I know it did because my money is gone.

<U+2B50>1/2"
"2108","@ahouseingotham Then stay away from Hellboy"
"2109","Hellboy was so bad that it made me forget how good Shazam was. I feel bad for everyone involved in the production of Hellboy. It’s a disgusting mess of a film. I’m sad for what could have been a great movie."
"2110","Can't stop thinking about how gory and bloody fun #Hellboy was! @DavidKHarbour stepped into the horns and I can't think of a more appropriate person to take it on. I can't wait to see it again!"

"2124","@AngryJoeShow we didn't get hellboy 3 because mike mignola (creator of hellboy) disliked the Deltoro movies and wanted a reboot.  and because Guillermo Deltoro  was asking for 150 million budget and the studio wouldn't go over 85 mil."
"2125","#Hellboy First 40 mins are an absolute blast. Then it falls off a cliff about as badly as a film can. Horrendous CGI that, no exaggeration is as bad as The Scorpion King.

I was almost waiting to see the producers walk on screen to interfere with a scene."
"2126","That new #Hellboy boardgame by @manticgames is very fun to play. The only issue with it is that the Kickstarter edition is so huge it takes quite some time to pack away afterwards"

"2128","Just saw #hellboy honestly not bad, definitely different from the original but still not bad."
"2129","The hellboy remake looks so good but I feel weird about watching it because I love Ron Perlman so much and the new actor looks fuckin odd to me"
"2130","The new HELLBOY is such an odd admixture of things that are right off the page and things that are very much NOT that watching it just became a weird, un-parsable combination of feeling familiar and wrong-shaped at the same time."

"2142","Hellboy or ""we know we don't get a sequel so let's toss everything in it and have some fun."" Exposition ALL the time. I loved it."
"2143","HELLBOY (2019): David Harbour is great as the title character, and there are some impressive creature designs, but the movie as a whole is an ugly, mean-spirited mess, with an inconsistent tone, unnecessary gore, and shoddy editing. (<U+2605>½ out of 4)"
"2144","are they playing a scary videogame or watching the new Hellboy movie. from the reviews it could very easily be the latter"

"2147","Hellboy was unfortunately the first movie of 2019 that I didn’t enjoy at all as it was such a massive misfire"
"2148","@Lionsgate next time when you hire a director let him direct the movie.  It's kind of what you paid him to do.  How many times does studio interface make a movie better.  Such a shame.  RIP #Hellboy"
"2149","Just saw #Hellboy with my dudebro @punchlogic and it was a breakneck paced, boring, dreadful movie. The best way I can think anybody can like this is when it comes out on Netflix or something and a group of guys get together to party and watch a crap movie."
"2150","In conclusion, if you want to see #Hellboy, watch the 2004 one, or just read the comics. If you for some reason can't contain yourself, bring some buddies and wait till the movie is a week or two old.. You'll be alone there, and you can just riff on the movie in peace."

"2155","His birthday lands on the new Hellboy’s opening weekend. He’s got to be enjoying the hell out of this."

"2189","Ok, So Seriously How Does Everyone Feel About the New Star Wars trailer?

Maybe it's the fact that I watched the new Hellboy movie right before I watched the trailer and was bummed about that movie so I took it out on the Star Wars Trailer, but I was thoroughly not impressed."
"2190","Saw Hellboy earlier and I loved it!

but WOW did i underestimate the gore"

It was a damn fun movie, it had everything you would expect it to have. It reminded me of a 90s monster/action movie. I mean come on it had gore/practical effects, good action, and a great looking #Hellboy ."

"2222","Hellboy should not have made another installment"
"2223","There are elements of the Hellboy movie that I enjoyed more than in previous adaptations. But I think it's a movie that gets louder, faster, and more generic as it goes on.  I didn't hate it but I don't think it's unwatchably awful"
"2224","@DavidKHarbour just watched hellboy today and absolutely loved it. @DavidKHarbour I thought your performance as big red was so great and I love the comic accuracy put into the movie. Thank you for giving me a hell of a good time at the movies."

"2226","@FreddyInSpace Predator's whole ""autism is a super power"" thing was problematic. Hellboy's better. More heart, more fun, more action, and wayyyy more self-aware. I think it'll find its audience."
"2227","Sad to say that Hellboy was, at most, a 3 star movie. Perlman was a much better Hellboy and both of the original movies were much better. Was hoping for a lot more. The story was lackluster; acting was lackluster; action was anemic; and I'll be surprised if there's a sequel."

Hellboy would think y'all were serious dicks for that."
"2233","@FreddyInSpace Here’s my favorite I’ve read:

"2259","The fact that Hellboy is sitting at 15%RT when every formulaic Marvel movie hits 80% minimum is a joke. It was not *that* bad. The only difference between Hellboy and Avengers is Avengers has star power and mind share. They are all solidly three star films."

"2270","ive for some reason been obsessed with hellboy without actually reading any of the comics/watching the movie so i might as well watch hellboy on netflix after having it in my list for a year"
"2271","Fighting depression by going out to watch Hellboy and having crawfish at a bar by myself. This is healthy, right?"
"2272","Do I have whiplash after seeing Hellboy because I had 3 Old Fashions beforehand or because it was a hacked up plot?"
"2273","@PrinceAwkwardII @nancipants I just want good sw movies. Ep 9 trailer looked good. Although trailers for 7 and 8 looked good. I'm hopelessly optimistic except for the new Hellboy. Eff that movie."
"2274","@HollyConrad @kayncli Sorry I missed it! Saw new Hellboy. Feel conflicted. Worth seeing for design &amp; visual FX, but there's so much wrong with it. Script is juvenile &amp; tries too hard to be edgy &amp; badass. Made me cringe A LOT! Baba Yaga's Chicken Foot Hut is exceptional!"
"2275","It physically hurt seeing Hellboy a second time"
"2276","@perlmutations Fuck the Reboot of Hellboy No Ron I boycott and dont go. #TeamRon"
"2277","@CriticallyTouch @leon_woodley You and I me both. I hope Hellboy fans enjoy it for what it is, and I hope the cast will continue to find success elsewhere. :)"
"2278","Do NOT watch #Hellboy on a full stomach <U+0001F922> entertaining af but forgot about the gore factor"
"2279","#Hellboy wasn’t THAT bad.. but yeah Del Toro and @perlmutations should have been allowed to make a part 3 <U+0001F62A>"
"2280","@bradmiska @FreddyInSpace @frankee_white Lmao miraculous.

Hellboy pulled in $70 million from word of mouth, against all odds, despite having a wide release.  Truly remarkable."

"2283","@8ALTON8 “The Eyeless One of Hitler” sounds like a Hellboy monster"
"2284","Hellboy was more disappointing than bad. Some good ideas, cool creatures but the tone, script (not one joke that works), plot, etc all pretty messy. Bizarre choices all over the place. Harbour immerses himself in the part, I don't know why you'd put Ian McShane in this movie."
"2285","I will say that I feel they keep trying to go too big with the story and character. Most of the hellboy stories are smaller, character driven ones and on that end I feel that Hellboy would be better suited to premium TV"
"2286","Supernatural but with Hellboy and the BPRD. They could even go the Fargo route and have each season take place in a different decade"
"2287","I’m going to watch HELLBOY tomorrow and even though I’ve heard some scathing reviews and seen fingers pointed at who’s fault it is, I’m STILL gonna watch it!"
"2288","1. It’s hellboy. I love the character and I can’t wait to see it on the big screen. 

2. I love David Harbour and still feel he’s a fantastic choice for the character and I still dig the design of hellboy this time around."

"2294","@perlmutations Happy birthday, Hellboy!!"
"2295","Hellboy came out and I didn’t know. I’m on the internet, constantly. YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, Podcasts, websites, satellite radio... constantly. Yet advertisers haven’t found a way to  target me. You’re doing a really bad job."
"2296","@MariaGaddis Shazam and Hellboy better be off too. They ain’t slick"
"2297","Wait, lemme get this straight. The Hellboy reboot without @perlmutations and @RealGDT sucked ass?!?!? I'm so shocked... <U+0001F644>"

"2303","Hellboy is definitely in “so bad it’s good” territory for me. I loved it with the same part of me that loved Sucker Punch &amp; Pacific Rim. 

It makes no sense, has no artistic merit, and I can’t decide if the script or the soundtrack was worse, but I had a hell of a good time."
"2304","(We probably needed another del Toro Hellboy though.)"
"2305","For the first time I've got absolutely no one to spend my birthday with today, and it feels a little bizarre.  Going to have a double bill of Hellboy and Shazam! at @cineworld followed by some @frankienbennys to pass the day methinks <U+0001F3AC><U+0001F354><U+0001F973>"
"2306","Did y'all know Dana Delaney is married to Ron Pearlman?  And that the new Hellboy (which doesn't appear to get it any righter than his version did) came out on his birthday?  Just kinda weird is all."
"2307","I’ve had an epic lie-in today, used to feel guilty when I’d do something like that, had such an awesome day yesterday thought I’d have a chill out day <U+0001F604>

Not judging myself too harshly you see <U+0001F609> 

What are you up to today?

Thinking of seeing Hellboy later <U+0001F60C><U+0001F4AF>"
"2308","Gonna attempt to be a professional film critic.

#Hellboy- on a scale from sticking needles in my own eyeballs to deep frying my own testicles still attached... they are still the better choice than having to watch anymore of that abomination."
"2309","I've been procrastinating over watching Hellboy...

Might go and watch it later, but really not expecting much"
"2310","I will forever mourn the fact that we will never seen the conclusion of del Toro's Hellboy trilogy."
"2311","I believe that #Hellboy is a serious dramatic remake of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL."
"2312","This is a genius plan, and you have altered the direction of my life."
"2313","1/3 My review on the latest #Hellboy movie: This was based on The Great Hunt &amp; if you’re not familiar with the comics, &amp; short stories, you’ve ONLY watched the last two Hellboys, then you may not like it. #HellboyMovieReview"
"2314","2/3 My suggestion is to forget about the others and don’t try and compare while watching this one, sit back, and enjoy it. I understand that the budget was very low and that shows in the cgi. #Hellboy #HellboyMovieReview"
"2315","My kids learned many English swear words after watching #Hellboy ... The character with a pig's head could have been written without swears being every second word."
"2316","Also, although it’s not a trilogy, I like to think that Under the Shadow is a sequel to Aladdin. A stark lesson in why you really shouldn’t release an omnipotent magical creature from its restraints."

"2319","@RahulKu40466995 @Hellboy I think you might be reading that wrong..."
"2320","@FreddyInSpace @HorrorMovieBBQ @OPWchris Nope.  Not now the rights went from Universal to Millennium.  They’d have to bounce back again.  

It’s possible, though.  We started on Hellboy at Universal.  The movie went into turnaround there after the director did a draft, and ended up several years later at Sony."
"2321","@JAMALIGLE The new Hellboy apparently sets the new low bar"
"2322","@germainemurray_ Hellboy without Ron Pearlman is always gonna be a disappointment <U+0001F614>"
"2323","I thought in this country where they're so keen on promoting ""be religious or hell otherwise"", they'd be more enthusiastic showing the horror of hell. But no nope. And that confuses me.

"2325","@Lionsgate @IMAX Now that your terrible decision to reboot Hellboy has bombed, can we get a third @RealGDT Hellboy like we actually wanted?"
"2326","@ExiledCaste Ah is Hellboy a similar premise? 
I guess Pet Sematary was predictable as you say, but they didn't lean too much on any kind of a twist, just the pure horror of the dead not really being dead."
"2327","What’s up with Hellboy’s rough sensor chop?! Gengges to the max."
"2328","@tlrledbetter The problem is that the movie didn't get enough promo, i have seen more of Hellboy and Shazam. Not to mentioned, we had recent Big Foot like movies. Does suck since Laika put a lot of work in their movies, just hope this doesn't affect them much but should consider promoting more"
"2329","I agree with @JoshUlrich Go to your #publiclibrary and check out Hellboy: The Wild Hunt if you want to compare the new movie to the comic source. Only then are you allowed to complain"
"2330","@Thafnine Having seen other movies, do you think you would consider Hellboy to also be a movie?"
"2331","Today with my amazing girlfriend:

Try the special new Buffalo Wild Wings Dragon Fire Game of Thrones wings

Watch the Hellboy reboot 

Watch the premiere of Game of fucking Thrones season 8"
"2332","This is a win for everyone. Including Hellboy and A-List."
"2333","I really enjoyed Hellboy. Totally different animal than the GDT movies, but it was a lot of fun. I’d love to see David Harbour get another shot at it, he nails Mignola’s Hellboy. If not a sequel, maybe a TV series?"
"2334","I never cared for the reviews. Go see a movie, judge for yourself, don't let someone else tell you what to watch. #Hellboy"
"2335","Saddest thing about the “Hellboy” box office bust is that there aren’t even Dark Horse fanboys online accusing critics of being paid off by Valiant."

"2343","@cineworld Think you need a review of how you list subtitled films on your ticket vending machines. Walked out of a showing of Hellboy for a refund; unwatchable for the audio description subtitles that weren't mentioned during the booking."
"2344","@oalian75 From everything I've heard about this film it sounds like they didn't really get Hellboy at all. What a shame."
"2345","@Dyslogix @perlmutations The fuck does Hellboy have to do with Julian Assange? Or pigs? Or muthafuckas?"
"2346","AIM away message: Still confused about Hellboy"
"2347","Turns out that if you watch basketball all day while reading about horror-moms and cap the day off by reading Hellboy in Hell and listening to The Two Towers audiobook as you drift off to sleep, you'll have some really weird dreams. Gonna do it all again today, tho."
"2348","Also, I think @davidharbour_ did a very good job as #Hellboy given the dialogue in the script seemed...questionable in the #HellboyMovie. There were a lot of poor choices in music that killed the tone of the film throughout, but I would see a #LobsterJohnson movie any damn day."
"2349","Saw the new #Hellboy movie, and I just have a ton of mixed emotions. There was a lot of promise in the first half of the film, but the ludicrous amounts of cartoonish gore, piss poor choice of music and cringy dialogue killed a lot of what makes Hellboy a good comic. 5.5/10."
"2350","HELLBOY was such an entertaining supernatural/fantasy film but the viewing experience would've been much better if the person next to me did not used his phone, chewed loudly &amp; discussed the story he had missed (while he was on the phone) the WHOLE DAMN TIME <U+0001F643><U+0001F643><U+0001F643> #shitpeopledo"

"2353","Okay so. Hellboy. Everyone was saying it had a plot problem, that the acting was bad and the characters didn’t make sense, whatever. 

I call bullshit. The only problem the plot had was that it was very frantic. The acting was fucking great, eat my nuts, and the characters and"
"2354","Fuck me, the new #Hellboy is a mess. Spoiler-free review on @BigDamnCast's YouTube tomorrow. I really, really wish I had nicer things to say about it."
"2355","@jennferatu @GaylyDreadful Hellboy did that to me. But it also took so much dumping from other critics that I was energized by having something positive to say about it."
"2356","@perlmutations And on another note...Hellboy isn’t Hellboy without Ron Pearlman."
"2357","#mikemignola thank you. Please read our review."
"2358","I've never had a movie take me and then drop me as fucking hard as Hellboy did. Holy shit. It's like someone flipped a switch like 30 minutes into the cut"
"2359","Won't lie. I was pure getting drunk at the cinema last night with the lads last night watching the new hellboy. As a result I am very much dying. Steam is likely to be very late if not at all. Will see if I can resurrect from this mad sky wizard style."
"2360","@call_me_salome Yeah, the fandom has you covered. There are quite a few female #hellboy versions out there — cool cosplay takes and fanart illustrations —, and a good number of them are anything but lollipop-like. 

I wonder which one is @artofmmignola's favorite. <U+0001F642>"
"2361","@FakePlissk3n More variety in creatures, the angel of death was a cool design.

The first has a slight edge over the second because it feels slightly darker it’s also when I had no idea what Hellboy was and my friend just happened to have it on DVD and I loved it."
"2362","“Make mine #Marvel” 

Man imagine being this fucking boring especially considering that Shazam is one of the best comic book films of all time &amp; the Del Toro Hellboy films are better than the MCU"
"2363","No

Last time Netflix made a show about a favorite superhero of mine who wears red &amp; is devil related, they canceled it

Also why should the Hellboy franchise go ‘fuck the movies’? Hellboy 1 &amp; 2 are 2 of the best comic book films"
"2364","A grown ass man also producer to hit films such as

This should be the easiest adaptation in the world to make. But they keep ignoring the greatest source material ever made."
"2381","@mkgeiger1968 @russellgoodson1 @THR “Involved” is a contractual statement not an artistic one. Look at the execution of the movie, does it LOOK anything like Mike’s visual or storytelling sensibilities? It’s not Hellboy."

I just wanted Guillermo Del Toro and Ron Perlman to complete the Hellboy trilogy."
"2385","@bipolarvision I always suspected this Lol. The thing is that Marvel has started to over-correct the seriousness of Nolan's Batman films. One just has to look at Del Toro's Hellboy films, or better still, Burton's 2 Batman works in order to get this right."
"2386","Oh man, #Hellboy to me after seeing it, I thought it was alright. I didn't hate it and it's not the best than the 2004 Hellboy movie. I'll just say this, it does have problems and there are a few things that hurts the movie."
"2387","Pros: Hellboy looks awesome. Settings were neat. Some good action scenes. Few actors were good.

Cons: music editing didn't feel right in the mood, plot gets out of hand for jumping one place after another.  Character interactions aren't great. Most CGI is bad.
Rating:6.5/10"
"2388","Not the worst thing to watch but it sure was entertaining enough for me to say it is alright, I say go see it if you're interested but I recommend watching Hellboy from 2004 first."

"2399","Hellboy sure had some neat demons with creative kills and gore that they used for all of 3 minutes! Also dug Baba Yaga even though she had zero reason to be in this movie- like most of the things in this mov-what the HELL did I just watch? GET IT HAHA HELL CUZ ITS HELLBOY HAHAHA"

"2401","@PamRobins3 It's great you enjoyed it but for me I disagree with all those points the babayaga science was the only good part in the movie.

Fright Night (1985)

"2437","HELLBOY wasn’t a complete disaster. I think a lot of people would’ve dug it more if it had a better script. I know I would’ve. Despite the messiness, there were a lot of cool, bloody moments."
"2438","@danjedgar @Geezer2k18 Don’t see hellboy I haven’t but my god the reviews are lower than any I’ve seen in recent memory fuck that it’s too expensive to say “ah maybe it’ll be good” these days lol"
"2439","@RealGDT the real Hellboy….we do miss him."
"2440","@Demonic_Simian you're forgetting about Hellboy (2019). the definitive take. 1/1 comic accurate. 90% on RT"
"2441","Someone come watch the new Hellboy with me"
"2442","@LGTHBlog I just did a 10 minute podcast review of HELLBOY just then. Off-the-cuff and unedited. Haha."
"2443","@SarahJoSmiley I read your Hellboy review. Oh. As a fan I still want to see but I'm not gracing it with a cinema visit. Thank you for suffering for us. <U+0001F601>"
"2444","So I read the reviews of Hellboy and they weren’t positive but we went to see it anyway. I’d just like to say that they were wrong. I’d like to but I can’t. It’s hugely disappointing. For me anyway. You make up your own mind."
"2445","Hellboy 2019 is just mediocre. But still good cameo from The Lobster. Ben Daimio and Alice apa tah is just okay. GDT's Hellboy still the best tho imfho"
"2446","What a good sport<U+0001F49C>
Y'all know I would've been petty <U+0001F923>"
"2447","Ya'll were too distracted making fun of how much the Hellboy reboot sucks, you forgot that a Laika movie came out this week that flopped even more than that.

Goddamn it, people."
"2448","@Bosco685 @ComicsNerd2 I definitely didnt hate it. While Its not visually pretty like Del Toro’s, it hurtles through its story pretty fast, and the monsters were genuinely scary. My biggest beef is that Harbor’s Hellboy is a little chattier/ quippier than i prefer. Overall id give it a 7/10."
"2449","@Jordana_LaQueen @cam_junge I did. I thought the movie had a lot of fun moments, the creatures were cool, it was pretty gory and David Harbour was a good Hellboy. However, it was kind of a mess of a film, they cram a lot into the 2 hour run time and unless you’ve read the comics they don’t explain much"
"2450","@DougTenNapel @russellgoodson1 @THR Honestly, the animated Hellboy is the best adaptation."
"2451","@DanaDelany @perlmutations Holy cow I had no clue u were Mrs Hellboy!"
"2452","Hellboy has a lot to learn about storytelling and the pace at which to tell it, but you know what? It wasn’t a terrible movie. It just needs work."
"2453","One of my comanagers told me that Hellboy's more violent than the Deadpool movies. Think I'll see it tomorrow cuz that's a bold statement XD"
"2454","@perlmutations Dude. Saw Hellboy 3. Omg. What happened? My heart is broken in like a 1000. What is with the industry? How do you ruin a concept like that?"
"2455","@AndresEladio There isn’t anything to think about.  The original team nailed it on the first movie!!  My mother in law LOVED the first two movies as well but she was annoyed when Hellboy sang to Barry Manilow. <U+0001F923>. I thought that scene was great!!  @actordougjones"
"2456","Some fantastically gory visual effects aside, the new #Hellboy film is an unforgivable mess. Embarrassing script, poor acting, a weird sound mix making the bad accents even worse &amp; overall a waste of my time. I just wanted The Blood Queen to put me out of my misery."
"2457","@ChrisAnonymous I love hellboy,  I was pulling for this one to be great . So disappointed it's not getting good reviews ."
"2458","@TEAMHOSFOREVER Captain Marvel left a lot to be desired, but when compared to Hellboy it definitely comes off tops"
"2459","Hellboy debuted with an estimated $12.02M this weekend.

#Hellboy  #BoxOffice  @Lionsgate  @HellboyMovie"
"2460","So, Hellboy was actually okay. Not the best Hellboy, Story was too fast paced, but visual effects were amazing and characters really great too ! I’d give it a 6/10 ! @jam_face"
"2461","@IGN @hellboy_news To counter these comments here. Note: Not everyone didn’t love this movie, Someone out there did-Me.&amp; I think there’s more-I thought David made a great Hellboy &amp; the chemistry among the actors were great-I just loved all of their performances-I will see the movie again-I LOVED IT"
"2462","@hellboy_news @Gabe_KC @IGN Don’t think after this journey all of them had to endure to promote this movie &amp; now after the reviews, criticisms &amp; box office, there will be another, so that’s a bummer. But that’s movies for you-Unfortunately  Hellboy will remain on the pgs of the comics &amp; that’s a bummer too"
"2463","@Gabe_KC @IGN @hellboy_news I guess we each walked away with a different feeling for the movie. In this case we will have to agree to disagree. I Loved it. David Harbour was amazing as Hellboy and I will see again. More popcorn for me."
"2464","@perlmutations The ONLY Hellboy! There can be only one."
"2465","Wow, i do not get the hate over #Hellboy 

The movie was a fun romp and @DavidKHarbour was a fantastic Right Hand of Doom"
"2466","He also directed one of the most memorable episodes from the early days of Game of Thrones. 

Season 2, Episode 9 - ‘Blackwater’.

Hellboy is a stain on his recent filmography."
"2467","We saw hellboy last night and it was SO fuckn good it absolutey blew us out of the water. Everything every second was so enjoyable and perfect"
"2468","Had a GREAT time with #Hellboy! The monster design was excellent, and @DavidKHarbour was such an entertaining Hellboy. This flick is a wild ride of zany ideas mashed together, and I really dug it."
"2469","Lel. It looks like the #BPRD hash tag is mostly used by some high-school in Arkansas. I guess I'll start attaching #Hellboy as well to my BPRD tweets."
"2470","I went to Hellboy with a friend so I can make him see Detective Pikachu with me. (Hellboy was about as good as an Underworld movie, which is to say not very)"
"2471","""But he ages differently!""

Yeah, sure, but a 60 year old character entering puberty is still going to look different than a 13 year old character. Plus, the comics have him becoming adult in size pretty quickly, so he's been ""adult"" Hellboy for a LONG TIME."
"2472","@chance_second I think the problem is that people want the title character to have an arc, but treat him like Cap in the MCU: most of the time he creates arcs for others, not for himself. Hellboy's pretty solid at this point."
"2473","Seen a few films @cineworld this week #Hellboy which was pretty bad, #WonderPark which was ok and #MissingLink which was actually pretty funny! #CineworldUnlimited"
"2474","#Hellboy rocks! A solid franchise reboot effort, with more adrenaline and gore than I was expecting. With all the critters, it felt like #warhammer got loose in a movie. The giant fight was a standout. <U+0001F60D>"
"2475","@MC_Hatt Yup lol. My best way to describe Hellboy is: it's ""Goblin Slayer""  with the attitude of ""Rick and Morty"" and then there's occasional"
"2476","Saw the new HELLBOY twice this weekend and I loved it and I'm not sorry."
"2477","@RealGDT How many different actors have played Batman? Or Sherlock Holmes? Or any number of characters?

There can be more than one Hellboy."
"2478","HellBoy is a pretty good movie. It’s cool to see them take a different approach with this reboot. The action was thrilling. There’s 2 post credit scenes y’all gotta stay for. Can’t wait for the sequel."
"2479","I wanna watch #HellBoy tomorrow.... but is it an appropriate time????"
"2480","Hellboy, tara @Rand0mguyPh"
"2481","@_ChristopherM Yeah this film is almost in a similar HellBoy category as far as what it could possibly earn Opening Weekend, but Die hard fans/fanatics I’m sure won’t let it fall like HellBoy has...then again you never know anything is possible"
"2482","Abis nonton hellboy, lumayan pemanasan sebelum nonton Game of Thrones season 8 besok."
"2483","#HellBoy You know a film is trying to push the age rating when it has several amounts of swearing its its first couple of lines. Such a dissapointment. David Harbour is great but that's just about It. I'll expand more in my review. <U+0001F614>"
"2484","Going to see the new HellBoy today!!! Or as Jax likes to call it, The Great Guy movie."
"2485","It wasn’t as good as the first two but if you can just shut your brain off and enjoy it like a mindless type of movie, it’s pretty fun."
"2486","“the predator and hellboy are two movies that are getting some rightful criticism but will later he held in high esteem by the horror community”

do you…realize that’s a real wild dunk on what you think the horror community wants in a movie"
"2487","I don’t say stuff like “a good hellboy movie would have him with the same attitude as Stanley from The Office” lightly, but it’s a point I’m not real flexible on"
"2488","@artofmmignola How does Hellboy stack up against your work? The reviews aren't great at the moment. Would love to hear your take #Hellboy"
"2489","@avpgalaxy @perlmutations The only hellboy"
"2490","It’s going to 3-Peat before Endgame comes out"
"2491","Hard Pass, this movie sucked"
"2492","Hellboy (2019) is one of the most unnecessarily violent films I've ever seen."
"2493","The only way to cleanse the Hellboy franchise is to fuck the movies, and move to streaming. I'm 100% on board with a Netflix series about the character."
"2494","@velvetgh0st Hellboy and Captain Marvel"
"2495","Found it hard to watch. Great cast let down by bad, unnecessary British accents. #Hellboy"
"2496","I'd hate to be Mike Mignola. They made two critically and financially successful Hellboy movies, people wanted to see a third, the director and actors wanted to make it. But Mike had to sign off and wouldn't because the movies weren't what *he* wanted."
"2497","After cleaning the kitchen imma watching movies. I think Hellboy and Labyrinth."
"2498","About to watch Hellboy! I'm far too excited"
"2499","I am very, VERY Disappointed with how Hellboy turned out. David Harbour is fucking great in the role and it had some decent moments but man. Very gutted with how this turned out :/"
"2500","about to eat pasta watching the new hellboy. what a combo x"
"2501","@NoahHarald @shelleygusto This has been a banner month for me. I saw US, PET SEMETARY and HELLBOY all in the theater."
"2502","@Fallout911 I liked the first 2 Hellboy movies, and their chi sucked back then."
"2503","@RealGDT The real #Hellboy"
"2504","I can't stop think about how much better this new Hellboy could've been and am saddened by the fact that we're going back into a media drought for the franchise beyond comics... The latest arc of which is about to end..."
"2505","Going to see this later this week. I have the feeling I'm walking into a meat grinder"
"2506","@sjb_astro That is just so Steampunk.  Looks like it should be a prop from #Hellboy"
"2507","The only reason people watched Hellboy is because of Mike Mignola. And he deserves better."
"2508","Hellboy was worse than expected. The flow is awful, video cutting is trash, music choices is so cringy, the jokes are very annoying and there're  a lot of unnecessary plots. The trailer is a better movie than the movie itself."
"2509","@redhorneddemon “What’s up with the name hellboy ? Are you really from hell ?”
She tilted her head to left"
"2510","seeing the new hellboy is the equivalent of speedrunning doom while watching thor ragnarok"
"2511","one of the complains people have made about hellboy was that the humor is too dry or forced or that hellboy shouldnt make humor and im like
have any of you read the comics because hb is very straight faced when he makes his one liners in the best and worst moments lmao"
"2512","Loved the restart of Hellboy. Now wonder: if there is a second part, you will return to the role of Abe? The last scene makes one hope @actordougjones"
"2513","@Horror31 @choptopmoseley @perlmutations Happy birthday to the best Hellboy"
"2514","Right after she watched it she said to me and I quote ""I'm talking very fast and Google can't keep up with my emotions."" and THAT is the only review that matters"
"2515","@HellboyMovie @Wizzun With the end and post credits.... We got to get a sequel! Please Lionsgate, even if box office is below expected a sequel could make more and recoup any loss on this amazing movie! It's the comics come to life for real! No fairytale story telling this time. How Hellboy should be!"
"2516","@sluts_guts The proper Hellboy!"
"2517","@HellboyMovie went to watch Hellboy(2019) movie today! Censor
has just played with their hands..... Muted several dialogues, deleted several fantastic scenes. This is one of the reasons, what makes people to watch pirated movies which leads to piracy! Just my money got wasted!"
"2518","That new Hellboy movie is getting so little coverage that it's hard to believe it actually exists. Everyone just wants to sweep it under the rug as quickly as possible."
"2519","Somebody take me to the movies to see Hellboy <U+0001F62B>"
"2520","Adverb the Movie Nerd talks Game of Thrones and reviews Hellboy.  Join the conversation at adnerbthemovienerd  Movie reviews from a middle school teacher."
"2521","@thisismynameduh Do I need to see the previous Hellboy to understand this one?"
"2522","'Hellboy' is all gore, no brains. Yes, not unlike modern day political campaigns this movie caters to the easily entertained."
"2523","Enjoyed HELLBOY a whole lot - great fun if a little messy. Harbour is terrific. 
The humour and gore are amped up (the latter unnecessarily) and they retread certain beats from the first film which was unwise, a straight sequel would've been wiser (which this 90% is)"
"2524","Now watching Guillermo del Toro’s Hellboy version with Ron Perlman on Netflix. I love the Cthulhu mythos reference!!! — watching Hellboy"
"2525","What did they expect? Literally NO ONE wanted a Hellboy reboot"
"2526","@iamthatroby Well surely that was multiple years ago around the time he made the other ones?
These days they might have thought of it as a new relativly-cheap franchise cash grab

tbh I've never been caught up on Hellboy, only a casual viewer so my facts could be way off"
"2527","Was going to see the new Hellboy movie, but something inside of me told me to go see Wild Rose instead.  So glad we did.  It was fab!"
"2528","@THR Hellboy is out? And there lies it's issue."
"2529","Hi so just want to pop in and say I saw ""Hellboy"" this weekend &amp; while that movies was. . . not good, it did give us 1 Very Good Thing: Daniel Dae Kim in a superhero movie. It is mind blowing to me that we're a decade into the era of Superhero films &amp; he's just appearing."
"2530","@1TheStickman1 Besides, speaking personally here, what about Hellboy was really all that interesting anyway? The fact that the titular characters swears?"
"2531","I'm honestly not sure what would've made Hellboy stand-out anyway. Your protagonist dropping f-bombs doesn't automatically make for a good movie..."
"2532","In conclusion, I need more Hellboy gifs."
"2533","@perlmutations  you will forever be my hellboy, I really wish they would have  let @RealGDT  and yourself keep it going.  #hellboy"
"2534","Hellboy opened with $12 million lllololloll"
"2535","Saw both #PetSemetary and #Hellboy this weekend. Both absolute crap. Gutted."
"2536","I wish more loose sequels were made and less hard reboots. Honestly Hellboy wasn't popular to begin with, who wants to sit through any part of an origin story again?"
"2537","An opening 48% less than the 2004 movie. Great Rebooting."
"2538","#Hellboy collected around $12M this weekend. @Lionsgate must be  highly disappointed on approving a sequel for an already struggling franchise."

"2540","I really want to watch both of these films!! #HellboyMovie #LittleMovie #BoxOffice #cinema"
"2541","So I saw the new hellboy movie last night, and all I have to say is I'm beyond pleased with it! It had a alil bit of a 90s gore horror thing to it."
"2542","I liked Hellboy. Kinda loved it. Very iffy cgi at times. I can see why critics and others hate it. I disagree."
"2543","Damn they really dropped that Hellboy reboot on Ron Perlman's birthday and premiered it in Mexico after replacing Del Toro. Is this unintentional shade? <U+0001F914>"
"2544","@GiteshPandya Might not even hit 30 million total domestic if word of mouth is completely toxic. Ouch. #Hellboy"
"2545","@BDisgusting On good. Because The new Hellboy movie is not good, I'm glad to see audiences knowing where their wallets should go to."
"2546","@WeeklyPlanetPod 
Hellboy currently has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes, and I have to admit it kind of deserves it. Weird editing. Terrible CGI composites. And the right hand of doom never looks half as good as Perlman's. Sadly have to say worst movie ever."
"2547","Black Girl Magic!  Going to see it now."
"2548","Love that!"
"2549","Forever who went and supported HELLBOY over Missing Link
I’m so disappointed <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D>"
"2550","I’m so happy shazam stayed at the top...
But also super sad to see Missing Link not be even close to the top..."
"2551","DO NOT watch this movie. It is absolute trash, and the perfect example of bad directing, writing, CGI, editing, and everything else that makes a movie."
"2552","I really wanna go to the movies at noon to see #Hellboy but how this rain acting idk"
"2553","There are no words to describe the new Hellboy. It's the most ridiculously bad thing I've seen in a while and I will watch it again. It's a sight to behold."
"2554","Damn bruh they should have just fucking given Del Toro the chance to finish his Hellboy Trilogy. Also Lionsgate are dumb as hell for thinking Hellboy would be able to compete with Shazam and Avengers Endgame."
"2555","Hellboy...LOVED IT.
If you like the comics you'll dig it...
The chap paying HB is awesome too...made the character his own."
"2556","have finally watched the movie: 'HellBoy' @ Filmgarde Cineplex Bugis+."
"2557","The previous movies made on #Hellboy were disasters, why is anyone investing in this character anymore?"
"2558","@MrZMovies Shazam deserves more but I see it’s already making a profit and they announced a sequel so I’m happy. Hellboy is better than reviews are saying. Wish they would have went more bonkers with it"
"2559","Just saw Hellboy with @wigginprime &amp; it was so bad. 

I love it so much because of how bad it was."
"2560","Imagine how bad “Hellboy” had to be to lose to genderbent reverse “Big” premiering a week after superhero “Big.”"
"2561","@fantacapsblog I feel a mashup coming on. LITTLE HELLBOY."
"2562","@PetrNeniBorec Certainly much better HELLBOY stories in the vault."
"2563","@fanta_vaclav @DanielRPK Since this new one looks like it will be a flop, there probably won't be a new Hellboy movie in 10 years and it won't be DEL TOROS vision neither <U+0001F614>"
"2564","the word dismal is really sending me right now"
"2565","Man was wishing that it will be more successful , still watch it but will wait till next week"
"2566","That HELLBOY movie is another great example of Hollywood making movies that nobody asked for, then being confused when nobody sees them."
"2567","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Watched #Hellboy and absolutely loved it!! This movie was unique and very intriguing. Thank you for providing such wonderful, wholesome entertainment this weekend!! <U+0001F917><U+0001F917>"

"2578","This felt kind of like the newest Fantastic Four reboot with its behind-the-scenes drama and Rotten Tomatoes pummeling. The best I can say for it is that some hardcore fans seemed to like it."

"2582","Hellboy is a great concept but I'd rather see some time-travel treasure hunt where he goes against the Nazis. No idea why they made another generic CG fantasy. From first trailer it was obvious this movie lacked good actors, unique visuals, style and strong villain."
"2583","//saw new Hellboy. Loved the homage to “chained coffin” and the Baba Yaga background banter - could have done with more on her frankly. They Nerfed Nimue’s power massively. Harbour portrayed him really well, more in keeping with his “aging” as he /would/ be a teen really. —"

"2595","Hellboy 4/10 What a massive disappointment. Harbour aside, this is awful and even he manages maybe 5% of what Perlman did. Jovovich, McShane and Sasha Lane are absolutely shite. Zero character development and incredibly jarring tones make this a totally forgettable mess (S)"

"2619","I wish people would stop pitting the new Hellboy movie against the old ones. They're very different. You can love both of them. #Hellboy"
"2620","@PamRobins3 @IGN @hellboy_news Yes, it was bad. One of the worst so far. It's cringey, badly written, the plot is ridiculous, there is no character development and real conflict at all, the supposed relationship between Hellboy and his father is a joke, and the brutality is often needlessly aggressive."
"2621","People are gonna use the new HELLBOY’s performance as evidence that Guillermo should have returned, and while I agree in principle, those movies weren’t exactly earners either. Shockingly, America just doesn’t care about a big red demon."
"2622","Not to keep @ ing the new hellboy but I loved the makeup art in the og... I wish they’d not tried to make everything gross and had instead tried to make the monsters memorable. A day later and I couldn’t tell u anything fun abt any designs, and HB looked sunburnt 1/2 the movie"
"2623","I don't understand why #Hellboy had to have such bad teeth and gross body hair. Why did you have to make him ugly???"
"2624","@VictorOjuel Whilst that sounds great, I wouldn't get the play out of it to justify the price. Still working out how to do that with this one, but it was Hellboy, so had to."
"2625","@ConclusionLoL @perlmutations @RealGDT Yeah ....
Well we move on .
Maybe in the future we will get a Netflix hellboy series ."
"2626","The new hellboy movie was hot garbage
So sad... David Harbour was actually a fantastic casting choice, but most everything else was terrible :("

"2634","FINALLY got to watch the entirety of the new Hellboy movie...and I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!! &gt;^____^&lt;

It managed to take a lot of important bits from the 12 graphic novels, make minor &amp; well adjusted changes to it, and squeeze it down to fit into a single, Epic movie!!! *Squeee!!!!*"
"2635","@twinkeldink34 The cgi is rly good, the plots a lil meh, but of you watched hellboy for plot ur a little mental in my eyes anyways <U+0001F923>, I did enjoy it, not a 10/10 for sure, but it entertained me through the whole movie, so it did its job to me"
"2636","@twinkeldink34 Im pretty sure they are gonna continue doing movies of the current one, at least there was a teaser in the ending of it, and I happened to enjoy the new hellboy aswell cause im not a person clinging onto nostalgia too much, so I didnt mind their new approach to it"

"2638","@perlmutations all I've heard is how bad the new hellboy movie is. I knew it would be. So disappointing. I was kinda wanting it to be good. I miss Hellboy. Once you had the best director, actors and story lines  you can't go back. So I wouldn't be wasting time on new movie.<U+0001F62B>"

"2644","Hellboy was nice, graphic and i love it, but it was a bit hasty(i really hope it’s the right word), i liked the characters, and Nimue wasn’t so bad, i was surprised, I thought i’d hate her, but no, she’s actually cool. But my boy Hellboy is the best, have a nice evening"
"2645","Actually forgot that hellboy came out this week"

It would still have the post-theatrical bail out, and would only have had to compete with the middling Thor 1, terrible Green Lantern, and good-but-not-super-popular Captain America 1 for Superhero fans."
"2650","I would like a Hellboy sequel if only Millennium doesn't butcher it by not allowing the director to do his job.  There 16 producers on the new Hellboy movie and they all pretty much destroyed Neil Marshall's original vision."

"2672","DJDDJSJS this video is so funny"
"2673","EVERYONE calm down (well mostly critics) #HellBoy is actually a VERY watchable film. The action is good fun, the gore is some of the best I’ve seen in any genre &amp; Hellboy himself is great fun! Some of the dialogue is a bit forced and the story could of slowed down a bit. 3/5 <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>"
"2674","Hellboy is by no means a fantastic film but there is plenty of fun to be had with it if you're looking for it. Also David Harbour is WONDERFUL!"
"2675","Hellboy was so much fun, I'm not sure what movie the rest of you saw. I've got a special place for GDT Hellboy but this was great and it knew exactly what it was."
"2676","@thesk_darram To be fair, I had zero faith in this film as it was only made to kick start a Hellboy cinematic universe and the trailers made look a rip-off of the del Toro films just with an R gimmick. But I at least had more fun with this than The Mummy (2017) &amp; Pacific Rim: Uprising."
"2677","@thesk_darram Oh I heard he's from the comics but I haven't read the comics. My only experience with Hellboy are the two Guillermo del Toro films, which I love to death &amp; are the thing that made me a big fan of del Toro's films. Still makes me sad that his Hellboy 3 was canned for this reboot."

"2687","The new #Hellboy movie is probably 10 years too late"

"2689","@perlmutations Happy Birthday to my favorite Hellboy!"
"2690","@dailyspiidey To be fair we’ve had a few. 

Including two amazing biggies (Marvel and Shazam), an absolutely garbage one (hellboy) and another presumptive dumpster fire on the way (Dark Phoenix). There is a discernible bottom here."
"2691","The story is fun. 7/10. I cried at last scene. and yeah.. make sure you watch till the very end of the credits.
#Hellboy"
"2692","Lionsgate: The only way to make Hellboy great is to make it R-Rated with a lot of gore! That oughta get people to seats!

*(sees critical reception and box office results)

Lionsgate: SHIT!"
"2693","No need for a new Hellboy. The films with Ron Perlman were great and aren't even old."
"2694","#hollywood is out of touch and has so few ideas they're remaking #Hellboy #HellboyMovie I mean, why not just make hellboy 3. Do people go to the #movies anymore anyway?"
"2695","@perlmutations Still the best Hellboy!"
"2696","Time to ignore ratings and watch Hellboy myself. I'm not expecting perfection, but still hoping for a 7/10 experience."

However I am absolutely elated for Shazam for doing so well <U+0001F60D>"
"2702","Oh man that's real bad, a real yikes to the tons of employees who worked hard on this film. Not saying it's a good movie and not deserve to fail. But this is like REAL bad."

"2704","Oh yeah hellboy update, the one thing i thought was gonna complain about not happening actually did happen at the end so, nah im p satisfied with movie lmao"

Four new wide releases were not enough to unseat Warner Bros.' ""Shazam!"" from the top spot at the box office this weekend.

"2713","On the upside, they can now green-light Guillermo del Toro's #Hellboy 3 since absolutely no one will remember this 2019 film."
"2714","andddd bloody"
"2715","Saw @HellboyMovie 
It had so much potential with amazing actors but the story didn’t flow nicely. Was a little over the place BUT I did enjoy the action sequences and HellBoy’s humor. Love everyone’s ability/strength!"
"2716","I really wanted Hellboy to be great. it’s a real shame I didn’t even know it came out this weekend. The movie barely got any promo. I really don’t think there was any faith in it to be honest. The reviews are looking straight yikes right now."
"2717","Sorry to say that HELLBOY is kind of a mess. Harbour is solid, but he deserved a better, more coherent story. More to come in review."
"2718","#Hellboy is awful garbage but at least it had some so-bad-its-good material I guess
Not the worst movie of 2019 tho tbh"
"2719","I can honestly see myself reviewing this
I have some things I really want to say about it that kind of took me off guard
I'll probably talk about Hellboy (and maybe Little) first tho"
"2720","@GabbyQuinteros Shazam is awesome, I have not heard much about Hellboy but it has done no business this weekend, it has 15% Rotton Tomatoes compared to Shazams 90%"
"2721","HELLBOY without @perlmutations ?  WTF?"
"2722","@WTHITFpod @_Riles23 I was just getting ready to tweet at you guys bc I couldn’t remember what you’re talking about on the next episode. Now I know.

If it makes @_Riles23 feel any better, my expression is the exact same thinking about recording Hellboy today."
"2723","Hellboy was cool if you like the more trashy movies of that sort that came out in the eighties and nineties. There was more lore than in the del Toro movies and a positive message about masculinity and fatherhood 4 kids in the end, which is kinda rare these days. I enjoyed it."
"2724","HELLBOY flopping isn't a surprise. I'm actually sad at how badly #MissingLink did. While it wasn't my favorite Laika film, the work they put into making their movies stand out from the rest deserves more than they've been getting."
"2725","@peterbriggs The original Hellboy movie will forever be the best. You did an amazing job! Thank you for your work."
"2726","Oh god, I just got dragooned into seeing Hellboy."
"2727","I had high hopes for this hellboy movie...the gore was great and the action is outstanding but the whole movie was a complete mess...absolutely didn’t like the take on the movie #butchered #Hellboy2019"
"2728","@LeesahSea Mostly cause people want to see how bad Hellboy is but they should be giving credence to films that are made in quality and a good heart"
"2729","The animated #hellboy movies are better than the live action ones. I would love to see a mature animated series pop up on adult swim."

"2731","Anyone seen new Hellboy yet? It’s probably whatever but still curious."
"2732","Going to see Hellboy
Let’s pray it’s good"
"2733","@genizh I'm still trying to catch up with some of their films. Lynch is great and I've liked/loved everything I've seen of his. As for Del Toro, he's had some high ""high's"" and low ""low's"" for me. I love Pan, and Devil's Backbone, but I really didn't like Pacific Rim. Never saw Hellboy."
"2734","@TheWellPod @actordougjones @RealGDT Was amazed Franco's related Pan's Labyrinth had the same father as Hellboy, but you see Dali's surealist and graphic influence in both, The Shape of Water was one giant heartbeat and a real case of less is more."
"2735","Hellboy was one of the funniest experiences at the cinema in a long time, for all the wrong reasons, I may add."
"2736","I need to go see that new #Hellboy"
"2737","Don't get people's gripe with @HellboyMovie it has some flaws but not enough to outweigh the good. Really enjoyed it. Felt like a nod to old grindhouse/B Movies films with some stuff ripped right outa the comics. Not to mention @DavidKHarbour fucking kills it has Hellboy!"
"2738","I hope that #Hellboy bombing doesn't create a picture of that universe that's negative. A poor, singular movie doesn't wipe away tons of great comic book story lines. I hope that we see the character return, even if it's in the form of yet another reboot."
"2739","How many people know the remake of Hellboy premiered today"
"2740","@chris_redar Haha, it's funny you mention this bc we saw the new Hellboy last night and I didn't get why it has such bad reviews when movies like Hansel &amp; Gretel, Van Helsing, Season of the Witch, and The Last Witch Hunter exist."
"2741","Now that tomorrow night has opened up... think I might bite the bullet and go buy #Hellboy tickets. 

F*** the haters, that movie looks amazing.

Besides... adverts must be doing something right. I wanna see this more than I ever wanted to see the first two <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"2742","@Kruegertastic The first statement is true. And she didn’t. She was bent on the ‘fate’ that hellboy was to pull Excalibur and rule by her side with his ‘true demon’ self and mentioned nothing about it."
"2743","@Kruegertastic I just saw the new hellboy movie. Just. What the fuck."
"2744","Why is hellboy...a descendant of King Arthur"
"2745","Man, the Hellboy backlash is a pretty good example of why you cant make movies for comic book nerds, because this movie is 100% more related to the comics and people hate it. Everyone wants Guillermo even though he ignored the source material"
"2746","Holy shit, friends. Ignore the rotten tomatoes bullshit. If you've ever read #hellboy then you will love the new movie. It's fucking nuts"
"2747","@Pandaandwolf But what is your ideal Hellboy story then?"
"2748","There’s a decent King Arthur short film buried in that Hellboy movie"

"2752","deadass just walled out of hellboy it makes me so mad they turned one of the best comics in history into one of the worst movies I have ever seen"
"2753","@TheAgentBurgos @primeknitpapi @michaelthackson @nghbrhood_watch @HellboyMovie It should already be assumed that it would need to be good considering we’re talking about good movies and earning money"

"2755","@Enc_scribbles @gottkomplex006 @IMAX @HellboyMovie Perlman sucked too! The only juice I drink comes straight from your moms titty!"
"2756","@gottkomplex006 @Enc_scribbles @IMAX @HellboyMovie Sorry I should have clarified, only half these responses were meant for you Gott"
"2757","@gottkomplex006 @Enc_scribbles @IMAX @HellboyMovie Buddy if “I like pancakes” qualifies as a wisecracking joke to you then yeah, I guess you can love any movie you want. Clearly we operate on different levels but my hats off to you for making the effort"
"2758","@Enc_scribbles @gottkomplex006 @IMAX @HellboyMovie Show me his jokes, I don’t believe you can find any."
"2759","@Enc_scribbles @gottkomplex006 @IMAX @HellboyMovie Sorry man I was busy knuckle deep in your mom... to his point, Hellboy isn’t the Spider-Man/Deadpool of the underworld... and I’ve never seen the actor capture what I read as the mood in these books. But thank please, snap a pic of your favorite Hellboy joke panels"
"2760","It's gratifying to see that much of what I liked about the movie actually came from Mignola and Harbour. I was pretty disappointed in the script and effects though <U+0001F613>"
"2761","I was kinda hoping I would love #Hellboy - I mean, critics all hated that second #GhostRider movie, too, but I will go to my grave defending it as a misunderstood masterpiece. (Plus, it's so much FUN!) But... nah, I could see nothing at all in #HellboyMovie"
"2762","@LookWhosFhtagn My first introduction to Hellboy was the Hellboy Junior TPB (a creepy guy in a Borders recommended it). Looking back the stories are mostly problematic, but the Mignola stuff got me hooked. Later I picked up the Conqueror Worm arc and I fell in love."
"2763","I love when Angry Joe &amp; his Crew just rip into a Movie. <U+0001F605> They are unfiltered &amp; raw... I love it. They gave the New Hellboy movie a 3/10 <U+0001F602> Soooooo funny!"
"2764","Hellboy can kill 3 huge giants in less than a minute but almost got killed by a giant pig which is much much smaller than the previous giants? It was the boring fight scene of the movie"
"2765","Well @Legendary now that its released and what all fans feared has been confirmed, hellboy is garbage. Thanks for ruining a great trilogy for this unneccessary reboot where the only difference in tactic was ""add more gore""."
"2766","Uggggghhhhhhhh

I can't remember the last time I nearly walked out of a movie, but #Hellboy 2019 almost made it happen tonight. What an ugly, joyless, apathetic piece of junk."
"2767","#HellboyMovie was SO MUCH FUN!!! 

I’m soo confused why everyone is dumping on this movie???? Like I saw some ppl were way angry AND IM SO CONFUSED?!"
"2768","@Sarnee @sarahhbickerton I’m seeing Hellboy, so I suspect you’re ahead on points."
"2769","The regular Hellboy hot sauce is a bit hotter, and is more like a traditional hot sauce. Almost tastes like a habanero sauce, strong pepper flavor with that little pepper sweetness you get from habanero."
"2770","So...Hellboy.

TheDel Toro movies were better. That’s kinda obvious.

But this was a pretty fun romp all the same. And I like @DavidKHarbour’s take on the character. Not bad."
"2771","@furkyourwurk I must see it! I love Hellboy in every other incarnation."
"2772","@AwkwardlyEnough I'm going tomorrow!! They were just late with the release. Seeing Hellboy tonight with Joe then he's taking me to After tomorrow.<U+0001F62D>"
"2773","So hellboy was great. 

If you have ever seen “Ash Vs Evil Dead” this movie is perfect for you. The gore and monsters are displayed just like the ones in Ash Vs evil dead. 

8/10 movie!

@HellboyMovie"
"2774","Also they should stop being cowards and give movie Hellboy his hooves!!"
"2775","@UglierGod @bottygerjoe @HellboyMovie during some moments of a fight scene or two yes. otherwise some parts felt like practical. So many imaginitive visuals there were parts I almost didn't miss Del Toro, Mignola gives this a blessing I'm sure."
"2776","@DullVivid ...that being said DID YOU SEE HELLBOY"
"2777","@UglierGod @bottygerjoe @HellboyMovie I'd rent that house"
"2778","So I just saw the new hellboy reboot it’s a fun movie and David harbour did a good job as hellboy but it has some problems, i wished the father and son dynamic between big red and broom was fleshed out more and the third act felt rushed"
"2779","GDT Hellboy also really makes me wanna snack. It’s surprisingly snacky. Baby Ruths, pamcakes, cookies. Makes it even more comfy, I think."
"2780","Rewatching GDT Hellboy. A bit silly in delivery sometimes, but it’s got a sincerity that’s very rare to come upon in Hollywood pics. Very comfy, watchable and rewatchable. Practical effects are gorgeous, of course."
"2781","Whew man i have thoughts about this #Hellboy reboot... Disjointed to say the least"
"2782","@OhItsTeddy @michaelthackson @paralyzedposty @nghbrhood_watch Nope. I haven’t seen Hellboy and won’t see it because it’s not my thing."
"2783","Keep thinking about #HellboyMovie 
It feels like they crammed a whole season of a Netflix show into one movie, making it exhausting, and confusing if you don’t know the source material.
But he also killed bad guys to Motley Crüe’s “Kickstart my heart” which was dope.
So torn."
"2784","Gruagach and Baba Yaga were the best parts of Hellboy 2019"
"2785","y’all i want to win this SOOOOO BAD"
"2786","if y’all can be pennywise fuckers y’all can be hellboy fuckers no need to hide"
"2787","I'm seeing #HellboyMovie tommorow. No spoilers please!"
"2788","Mine should be coming pretty soon.
#hellboy"
"2789","Hellboy kind of sucked. They clearly patched that thing together; it was loud, slightly boring, and rudderless. They, the filmmakers, forget things from scene to scene that makes you wonder if even they knew what was supposed to be happening."
"2790","@MegaDwagon I think a lot of critics see that DC took some risks in making BvS and JL that made them more faithful to the comics, but sacrificed a lot of that family friendly nature that Mickey Mouse ingrained into the MCU. Hellboy, also, was never meant to be for everyone."
"2791","watching hellboy with pop with no sound"
"2792","@IMAX @HellboyMovie Uh...no. New Hellboy is produced by a guy who told Terry Crews to be quiet about his sexual assault and then hired Bryan Singer (a known abuser) to direct Red Sonja (he was fired soon after). Why would I give my money to that?"
"2793","The new #Hellboy movie is awful. Just awful.
I wish @perlmutations was still doing them."
"2794","Instantly every poster on /co/ is an expert on Hellboy, yet has seemingly never read anything but some other anons summary of an article."
"2795","i’m gonna go see hellboy tonight completely disregarding the reviews cause damn it i’m here to see david harbour big and red and nothing more"
"2796","In my opinion, it's time for Hellboy to grow up and become a Hellman"
"2797","Tune into the next episode of No Capes Required to hear what @FLYtotheSKYE11 and Doug have to say about #Hellboy."
"2798","@Teacloc @RottenTomatoes @HellboyMovie I never listen to the critics"
"2799","Shout-out to @TwistyTroy, the AMAZING contortionist responsible for bringing to life the BEST ever portrayal of Baba Yaga, my all-time favourite character in folklore, in the new #Hellboy movie. This one scene and Troy’s performance make the movie worth the price of admission!"
"2800","Real talk here: if the premise for the new #Hellboy had been the third and final @RealGDT/@perlmutations movie, it would’ve had a better shot.

…Seriously though, Mr del Toro, I beg you to make a movie about Baba Yaga. ANY movie about Baba Yaga. I NEED to see GDT do Baba Yaga!"
"2801","Hellboy is really not that bad. 
5.8/10"
"2802","@MikeRisley Thanks Mike!

Gaming tonight with a friend tonight, running demos tomorrow, watching Into the Spiderverse with the fam and maybe some Hellboy thrown in too on Sunday.

Fun weekend planned. <U+0001F601>"
"2803","@AdrianR0binson He's busy with his new squeeze. I follow him on Instagram and I found it weird there was no mention of Hellboy for all that time. Just a bunch of pictures of him and that actress."
"2804","You know my biggest disappointment with #Hellboy?
Nimue didn’t turn into a dragon in the end.

Spoiler for The Fury/Wild Hunt: Nimue turns into a dragon in the end."
"2805","I feel like every negative review of #Hellboy is just sucking Del Toro’s dick. No, this isn’t like the Del Toro films. Try watching it as its own thing, dipshit. Don’t just compare it to the other thing you like and complain that it’s different from the other thing."

"2809","@artofmmignola I adamantly refuse to read reviews of Hellboy until I see it. Lots of critics are unimpressed, but I'm hoping for a ride that *I* will enjoy. This was never meant to be in the vein of the GdT movies. Scare quotes like ""A death metal cover of the GdT films"" sound GOOD to me!"
"2810","Hellboy and Liz practically RADIATE a bigass KiriBaku mood tho, with a few personality tweaks. 
HB-Kiri bc obvs RED, &amp; Liz-Baku bc explosively strong fire, like duh. 
Son of the Devil Kiri who is actually a sweetheart? Human Baku who's supposed to be perfect, but isn't?"
"2811","Hellboy didn't need a reboot....but I feel like if you actually read the series, you'd understand what's going on more.  Especially, with the characters....because it seemed like everything just happened with no reason why"
"2812","So, this week, Hellboy, Little, and Missing Link came out to theaters. Me? I went and saw #AfterMovie 

I watched One Direction fan fiction that was revamped.  I WATCHED FAN FICTION!!!

I bring this on myself."
"2813","@BlakeNorthcott Have you read The Wild Hunt? It’s the main inspiration for the new Hellboy movie."
"2814","Glad y’all doing this. Most people probably ran out immediately when the credits hit"
"2815","@Chet_Rulz @Enc_scribbles @IMAX @HellboyMovie You wanted humor, I showed you twelve examples and was working on even more. Not my fault that you nitpick, buddy. Thanks for the attempt."
"2816","@Chet_Rulz @Enc_scribbles @IMAX @HellboyMovie If you have a hard time believing that Hellboy is wise cracking and has a sense of humor, I'm afraid you haven't read any of the source material whatsoever, which is certainly not something that I can help you with."
"2817","@Chet_Rulz @Enc_scribbles @IMAX @HellboyMovie I still stand by that statement entirely as a way of pointing out why Del Toro's version was not accurate. Hellboy did indeed have a romantic relationship in the comics, with Alice Monaghan. That could have been portrayed and would not alienate fans whatsoever."

"2819","Hellboy is fucking awful from start to finish. It feels like a terrible paranormal action movie with hellboy characters CGId over it"
"2820","@perlmutations im at the movie theater getting ready to watch Hellboy! Im excited but sad! Wish you were in it!!!"
"2821","I know the new HellBoy  movie is gonna suck because they have ads on twitch for it. No good movie ever has had ads on twitch."
"2822","Tonight I was with my fellow students in the cinema and we watched the Hellboy Reboot movie... and sadly, I didn't really like this movie. The story and actors were not that convincing.  The only things I liked was the masks and special effects of monsters. #Hellboy"
"2823","Hellboy was the worst superhero movie I have every seen. No exaggeration, I really mean that.

I would rather watch a triple feature of Batman and Robin, Ghost Rider 2, and Justice League than ever see Hellboy again."
"2824","@HellboyMovie Idk why but I really liked this movie. Thought @DavidKHarbour was great and would love to see a sequel so they can iron out some of the bad."
"2825","@MonarchOfMemes It’s actually a really fun watch. I don’t know if you’ve read Hellboy in Mexico or The Wild Hunt but it feels like Mignola’s work come to life. It’s not perfect but it’s fun."
"2826","Out to see Hellboy tonight.

I heard the reviews but I’m still eager to find out for myself how it compares to the comics."
"2827","When I saw Milla Jovovich as the villain in the new Hellboy movie, I knew it was going to be trash"
"2828","N is planning to watch the new Hellboy tomorrow; I’m debating if I want to join or not"
"2829","I'm watching The Bad Hellboy Movie again and it's absolutely my favorite movie.  It's so fucking weird and stupid."
"2830","If anything the biggest failing of Hellboy the Bad Movie is that it doesn't rely hard enough on 80s hair and speed metal.  Like if that whole movie had just been Speed Metal constantly in the background it'd be 20 times better."
"2831","@DoctorsWolf Hellboy (2019) has gotten terrible reviews. It seems that, yet again, Hollywood has ruined a franchise by rebooting it."
"2832","@GhostMelter yeah.....it was way worse than i thought it was gonna be. i was really trying to be positive but that movie was a hot mess and hellboy was just the worst"
"2833","I knew it’d come to this smh"
"2834","@SwaddleN64 @ShannonTindle_1 @artofmmignola It's a difficult question. I usually say ""Start at the beginning,"" because one of the things that makes Hellboy what it is is its transformation. It grows from solid pulpy superhero monster comic to a staggering work of nuance of depth.  Sooo... there's that way..."
"2835","time to rewatch the old Hellboy movies those were fvcking good"
"2836","Ending Hellboy unexpectedly boring"
"2837","Is the new movie still Hellboy? How out of date am I and was it any good?"
"2838","And then I ranted about the new Hellboy movie for a while."
"2839","Mate, the new Hellboy movie explains more about @NickyWoolf full stop."
"2840","@Teacloc @RottenTomatoes @HellboyMovie Have the reviews said anything about how he gets his right arm sleeve over his rock hand?"
"2841","Does anyone really love Hellboy? The amount of attention spent on the franchise in both of its incarnations has always seemed disproportionate to the amount of passion people hold for it. Seems like it's finally time to put its film possibilities to bed."
"2842","@HellboyMovie If you really want to see Hellboy this weekend, you buy the Hellboy 1&amp;2 on Amazon for about $30."
"2843","@VMonitors @HellboyMovie I mean I grew up with the originals + comics and I thought it was great

yeah there are some things I would change but overall? I thought they did a good job and i loved @DavidKHarbour as Hellboy."

"2845","@ShannonTindle_1 @ZackDavisson @artofmmignola I would love to check out Hellboy... I've never really explored any comic books, but this looks really intriguing. Any suggestions on where to start?"
"2846","*Mentioning a few of spoilers about Hellboy*

I'm the only one who thought the scene when the demons started to invade the world for butchering humans in very gross ways looked similar to the gory mess what was the last episode of Blood-C or it's just me?

"2847","@Brentosaur <U+0001F605> You and I have been reading different hellboy comics... or we watched very different movies. Opinions eh?"
"2848","@HellboyMovie I hope the movie recovers it’s money ... someday."
"2849","@theBurk3nator Hope you get around to seeing Missing Link I thought it was great!! As for Hellboy I had no interest once I saw the trailers"
"2850","Well #MissingLink was incredible!! I really hope it does well this weekend with how shitty Hellboy is."
"2851","@JeffRogstadCTV I’m happy to share my XL Hellboy bunnyhug with you, pal. You can have Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I’ll take Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays. We’ll switch off every 2nd Sunday. <U+0001F609>"
"2852","The new Hellboy is a disappointment <U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FC>

@RealGDT is an artist that gave Hellboy, along @perlmutations, a unique character and sound history to tell..."
"2853","So I’m at hellboy and one of the previews was joker. It was the first time I saw the trailer and HOLY SHIT it looks amazing. Might be my most anticipated movie of the year. I had full body chills"
"2854","@getFANDOM @HellboyMovie Was anybody else constantly distracted by the weirdly deep cut of her dress which did no favors for her boobs? There’s even a line in the movie that mentions it <U+0001F602>"
"2855","#Hellboy was.. not great? Had a serviceable, paint by numbers plot, which was bogged down by weird pacing, bad dialogue, and some seriously wonky special effects. It wasn’t terrible, but pretty much every other superhero movie made in the last 10 years is better."
"2856","@LeifJohnson I made it through an hour of Hellboy before giving up and slipping into Pet Sematary instead, 'twas a good decision"
"2857","It just reeks of commercial slop made to cash in on the super hero craze"
"2858","@McGeekyDesigns Really dug the new Hellboy! Saw it last night."
"2859","I don't know what all the critics were talking about. I enjoyed #Hellboy But I will say, other than one song at the end, it did have a pretty horrible soundtrack. But it was good. I would support more in this franchise."
"2860","The Blood Witch says (New Hellboy movie) ""We  belong together you and I."" Hellboy ""We do. But this is not going to work you know, cause I'm a Capricorn and you'e F***** nuts!"" Great script writing. Saw it last night 5 stars!"
"2861","@herotease They need to realize After is gonna be bigger then Hellboy"
"2862","If I learned a single thing from the #Hellboy reboot, it's that Guillermo del Toro deserves to make Hellboy III now more than ever. I love David Harbour, but my god, the producers helped make this the next Fant4stic Four (and I hate myself for saying that)."
"2863","Imagine reading Hellboy and thinking a movie adaptation needs cool rock music, gore and swearing"
"2864","Had a lot of fun with the new #Hellboy, not going to lie. It’s a bit of a mess but Harbour is entertaining as hell and there are some really cool sequences. 

I think a sequel to this could be AMAZING if they focus in on a main plot and let their director make his/her film."
"2865","Hellboy was really really really stupid, got a few laughs, some cool designs and visuals with a neat soundtrack. It's no masterpiece but I had fun with it anyways"
"2866","@dantelfer @TessFowler I agree, your glowing reviews made me excited again to see it. Love Hellboy (and excited Mignola had a hand in writing the script I read.)"
"2867","Was teaching a friend about perspectives in character drawing and constructed this #hellboy"
"2868","Hellboy was better than I expected and also it is bad."
"2869","@edSiomacco I feel bad that in 2002, I shook hands with Ron Perlman at Yankee Stadium to thank him for his music thinking he was Tom Waits. Only to be validated a decade later when Ron agreed to play Tom in a biopic. Nothing to do with your question other than the fact that Ron was Hellboy."
"2870","@peterbriggs @hellboy_news I have a favorite Hellboy/Passion story. My brother and I went to see Hellboy and after it was over snuck in to see the last ten minutes of the Passion. I saw our preacher the next day and told him what we did (basically that we had seen the end of the Passion) he completely"
"2871","@peterbriggs @hellboy_news surprised me by saying that he too had gone to see Hellboy and was hoping for an Abe Sapien spin-off. He was pretty cool."
"2872","@Razorwing360 Honestly I'm just super excited for the 4k release of Hellboy 2."
"2873","Ok is it just me or does the new Hellboy movie look fucking terrible"
"2874","Only 30 dollars for the four hellboy omnibuses. Do yourself a favor and pick them up now you won't regret it."
"2875","Glutton for punishment because we are seated for the new Hellboy."
"2876","david harbour can huff my shorts! his hellboy DOES fuck!!!!! and he’s bi, in keeping with ron perlman’s hellboy!!!!!"
"2877","You had me at Meat Loaf’s album covers."
"2878","I was intrigued when I heard David Harbour would be Hellboy, but in my heart of hearts I was sure Guillermo del Toro was still the director."
"2879","@dry_lens_wipe @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour That should have been the 3rd hellboy based off the first two"
"2880","@dry_lens_wipe @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour It was like they where trying to start a whole new series off of somthing that already had a series if that makes sense. Any way that’s my “unpopular opinion”"
"2881","@dry_lens_wipe @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour David was good 100% no arguments there. I didn’t like the tacky humor. Original movie was much darker humor. The story of how hell boy came to be should have never been re explained. Majority of people who went to see it have seen originals or read comics."
"2882","@The_Poolshark I would not recommend going to see Hellboy"
"2883","@AngusReviews well...I’m a man of my word. I keep seeing the bad reviews for Hellboy, I’m gonna go see it tomorrow and if it’s truly as bad as they say, I’m still willing to go live and tear it apart."
"2884","The bad news is the new Hellboy movie apparently sucks. The good news is that's $15 I don't have to spend."
"2885","Y’all, the new Hellboy is REALLY BAD. Like REALLY REALLY BAD. I keep leaning over to @CptSpaceCat to remind him he is paying money for this torment."
"2886","I hear the new Hellboy sucks. 

Which is upsetting because I hate to give that blowbag @perlmutations any kind of credit at this point."
"2887","Time for #Hellboy and I'm a little worried the entire theater is empty"
"2888","Dig in, everybody! We have a great show this week!"
"2889","big shout out to the new hellboy movie for managing create the absolute worst version of one of my favorite comic book characters of all time. not sure who decided hellboy should be a whiny horny manchild but listen i just wanna talk"
"2890","Man of Steel ripped off Hellboy 1 and is a cheap knock off of that film"
"2891","@MattBellissimo Yep that’s my biggest issue like I want Hellboy 3 too but it’s like they didn’t give the reboot a chance

Not that the reboot gave us a reason to give it chance in its trailers"
"2892","@choptopmoseley @HellboyMovie Yesss, glad to hear you dug it!"
"2893","@HellboyMovie definitely worth the price of admission. Go for the gore, the action and the monsters!!!"
"2894","#Hellboy was simply amazing! Much truer to the source material than previous instalments with some amazing special effects and astounding performances by @DavidKHarbour @SashaBianca23 @danieldaekim. If you are a hellboy comic fan please go see this movie!"
"2895","In college, the Hellboy universe would branch out, and the BPRD series would carry things forward with an ongoing tale of a slow, realistic apocalypse like we've never seen."
"2896","The Corpse sees Hellboy dragging the corpse of a dissipated man around the graveyards of Ireland, looking for one that will take him."
"2897","In the Third Wish, Hellboy himself has become disillusioned with his life and being the guys who just makes the ""BOOM."""
"2898","I added pretty much every Mignola thing I could to my pull list, and I dove deep into Hellboy."
"2899","The characters that the Hellboy universe created -- Abe Sapian, Liz, Roger, Lobster Johnson, Kate -- are all so indelible in my mind, it's hard to express."
"2900","My two favorite Hellboy stories are The Corpse and Third Wish."
"2901","The first time I encountered Hellboy was when I bought the first three issues of Seed of Destruction at Comic Shop Plus in Newark, Ohio. I was 100% blown away."
"2902","The end of that comic is something that has stuck with me since the day I read it. It's an incredible, perfect piece of literature. What Mignola has done with Hellboy stands up with Tolkein, Vonnegut, Dick. It's immortal."
"2903","His soul is already sold, so Hellboy ends up fighting some faries to get back a stolen baby."
"2904","Im guessing not another movie..."
"2905","Eh, well, so the new @HellboyMovie 
What a mess of a movie that was! Think that's the only positive thing i can say about it! This will be a short lived reboot!"
"2906","Sitting in a theater, waiting for #Hellboy to start cause I guess I don't know how to effectively use 2+ hours."
"2907","Surprisingly I enjoyed hellboy"
"2908","@HNTR_official Multi talented. Strong Hellboy-style colours <U+0001F600><U+0001F44D>"
"2909","Should probably go see HellBoy"
"2910","Also my #hellboy quick review is scripted and I will be recording today if my interface isn't being glitchy as fuck"
"2911","It’s a good movie and i like the franchise."
"2912","About to watch @HellboyMovie tonight hopefully it’s good a lot of bad reviews on rotten tomatoes"
"2913","Just got done watching  #Hellboy 
I went with an open mind seeing it and had people describe to me how it was B movie type. Difference is Bmovies don't take themselves seriously but this movie did and  it was one of the many flaws of this film."
"2914","#Hellboy was so underwhelming and so disappointing because it had potential to be good and it was ruined by an awful script, laughable cgi and make up and some badly miscast people (David's hellboy was good tbh)
I just made me want del toros Hellboy 3 much more"
"2915","Btw #Hellboy R Rating they pushed so hard in their ads was a fucking joke. 
You gonna do an Rated comic movie, go all the way with it."
"2916","@mikeylazz @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour @RealGDT you know mike magnolia the creator of the hellboy worked on the production and screenplay of this movie right?"
"2917","@arianaxebel @evanmedinis @HellboyMovie i did not enjoy the ending at all."
"2918","@Quambles @HellboyMovie Those are also the same people that gave last Jedi a perfect score"
"2919","@FennikuFox @arianaxebel @HellboyMovie i don’t read the Shazam comics but I personally didn’t like the ending because it reminded me of the Incredibles. it just seemed very corny to me"
"2920","Dude the movie just sucks. Stop trying to blame the politics of the day."
"2921","@theBurk3nator But how does it compare to the actual early 2000s Hellboy? <U+0001F914><U+0001F914><U+0001F914>"

"2925","@robsaucedo2500 My co-podcaster @MouthDork is gathering an uprising of pro-Marshall HELLBOY fans here on the East Coast. I haven’t seen it yet but I’m sure he’s happy to know there’s a Texas chapter formulating."
"2926","This is what happens when you think you're bigger than you are. You refuse to take any criticism, constructive or otherwise, and end up sounding like Principle Skinner. ""Am I so out of touch? No... no it's the fans who are wrong."""
"2927","@Supfoool I can see that. I feel there's a sense of self-satisfaction in some criticism I have heard with aquaman that's residual of BvS and JL:DoJ but unwarranted in Aquaman itself. I wonder if that would spill over to hellboy's reception as much as I imagine it would."
"2928","Did you really think you could have a Hellboy reboot without Ron Perlman?"
"2929","Watching Hellboy II With the boy. My first time since theaters. First time watch for him."
"2930","If I end up liking the Hellboy reboot and agreeing with Grace Randolph it’s all over"
"2931","@getFANDOM @HellboyMovie 9% on rotten tomatoes but looking at FAN comments not critics comments and nothing but positive reviews @HellboyMovie looking fwd to it!"
"2932","It’s a shame the new Hellboy movie has received such a low score on Rotten Tomatoes, despite the fact that the comics are fantasticly written and graphically designed. I’m afraid I don’t to see my favorite superhero get torn apart."
"2933","hellboy (2019) was Metallica concert inside a marvel movie and I definitely need a nap."
"2934","Use this as an example of how not to make a movie. It was very bad. I can't stop thinking about how bad this movie was."
"2935","@CORINTHIAX_ @Noah3015 @Lilpeep Liza mentioned about part one and live forever being released soon. But I’m sure Hellboy will be uploaded someday, perhaps this year. We can only hope"

I also think the direction this movie took wasn’t familiar to many unless you were a hardcore fan and knew the comics."
"2938","@ForVortigern And I bet Nimue didn’t become the fated dragon she became before fighting Hellboy in the comics, either. Sad, sad.

"2943","Its movie date night but my bf wanted to see Pet Sematary and I wanted to see After, so we decided on Hellboy, I think we made a good choice @DavidKHarbour"
"2944","The dialogue may be terrible, especially with the supremely bad ADR quips, but goddamn, HELLBOY swings for the fences, and the production design is impressive as hell. Baba Yaga, Changelings, a bizarre cameo and a curious confidence make for a singular combination."
"2945","I have a long standing thought that the GDT Hellboy movies are interesting (if not overrated) films that pretty much just slap the Hellboy IP onto a different character.

People dislike that take and that's fine. But it's not the HB in the comics."
"2946","Taking a break from Marvel tonight because I dont want to watch Doctor Strange and am putting it off. Instead @nickcavicchio and I are delving into the two Hellboy Animated films to remember when Hellboy was good."
"2947","Saw Hellboy this afternoon. Uh, we had about five stories shoved into 2 hours of movie, some so so cgi, and moments where it was so loud it was hitting my sensory processing issues. It was alright but doubt I would watch again."
"2948","Saw Hellboy today. I really liked David Harbour's performance. He personified the character so damn well, but the movie fell kinda flat with its writing. I'm worried because the reboot needs to be fermented a little and I want a sequel to better it. (1/2)"

I will revisit this tweet whenever I watch Hellboy."
"2952","Now surprised the new Hellboy is bad, but kinda wished it wasn't. Then again, they put it 2 weeks before Endgame and just after Shazaam. It was destined to fail."
"2953","Not surprised the new Hellboy is bad, but kinda wished it wasn't. Then again, they put it 2 weeks before Endgame and just after Shazaam. It was destined to fail."
"2954","@Spider_Fed I saw it last night... I was so hyped after the first trailer, kinda got scared the more they showed, than finally disappointment last night after seeing it:( love the design and look of the creatures and hellboy, hated the writing and abnormally corny and typical tropes."
"2955","@CTopley @Squidgy_Pidgey I’ve seen movies do that before and somehow made it work. With the new Hellboy it doesn’t because it’s dispassionate about what it’s throwing at you. It feels like they were told to put a list of things in this movie, but not how to knit it all together."
"2956","Hellboy really flaunted it’s R rating. Every you turn it’s “fuck this,” “fuck that.” Aha look the pig monster said “fuck!” Here are some guys innards!"

"2962","Hellboy was a blast. It’s not Marvel. It’s not DC. It’s its own thing and it doesn’t apologize for what it is. It’s a violent, gory, action/horror flick with some throwbacks to the ‘80s and ‘90s. It’s true to its source material. It doesn’t try to be deep. 1/3"

what went wrong?
when a movie name is big with anticipation? film investments can produce a shit stain that recoup at opening weekend?

hellboy is an investment recoup movie? hence review of 30%?"

"2972","MORE THOUGHTS ON #HELLBOY2019:

Is it just me, or did this #HellboyMovie movie feel like it was crafted from a script originally meant as a prequel to the Del Toro films? With just a few minor changes, it could have been. All the way down to the end credit sequence."

"2974","David Harbour is a great Hellboy, and it’s not his fault. It was really cool seeing Lobster Johnson on screen but wasn’t NEARLY enough. Seeing some BPRD characters that weren’t in the old ones was cool but doesn’t make up for how garbage this movie was. Yikes dude."

-Tries to adapt too much
-Mexico was okay
-Damio is great
-Harbour screams most of his dialogue

-Comic fans will be super disappointed
-There is no breathing room in the story, just constant plot"

"3006","#Hellboy is kinda like the #dmc reboot to me. I'm disappointed in the way this film was put together and I disagree with the pacing and composition of many scenes. #Hellboymovie

"3008","Just bought tickets to Hellboy.... we are 2 of 7 people in the theatre..on a Friday night."
"3009","Okay, that was a lot of fucking fun. Make no mistake, this is not for a general audience. But if Neil Marshall turned loose &amp; cranked to 11 directing a fairly comic-faithful Hellboy adaptation sounds good to you, you’ll really enjoy this."
"3010","Even the shockingly dodgy-at-times cgi just felt of a piece with something that I think is going to turn into a cult favorite. This will be something to throw on &amp; pair with several stiff drinks. Cheers Neil. #Hellboy"

"3065","They start the movie off pulling from the Hellboy In Mexico tales. In the comic that whole tale seems kind of jovial and comedic, but ends up really sad. In the movie things just sort of HAPPEN and all of the tone is lost. Which ends up being a huge trend throughout."
"3066","Aw man I'm really disappointed in the Hellboy movie. I super gave it a chance and it was just rough. Mignola talked it up as more closely following his stories but there was definitely significant liberties taken and with clear sequel plans why not just start at Plague of Frogs?"
"3067","It felt like cramming too much nothing into a bulging plot, when it would have been really tasteful to use the original art to introduce BPRD with a summary of Baba Yagas plot before cutting to actual footage of Hellboy and the changeling to further introduce the character"
"3068","Thanks, Hellboy reboot, now everyone will think Guillermo del Toro's is the only way to adapt Hellboy."

"3143","@Pandaandwolf @HellboyMovie They did not adapt the whole king Arthur story. They left out the entire knights of England rising from the dead part. And what are you talking about? Just saw the movie. Even people who don't like it say David Harbor was great as Hellboy. He was straight from the comics"
"3144","So #Hellboy is pretty good. David Harbor does a great job. Story and villain were a little meh. Some interesting monster designs and a good mix of practical and CGI. Different movie than the original films but it's got some merit. Hopefully they get a sequel and can improve. 7/10"
"3145","@HellboyMovie Let’s see... this is the seventh time I’ve seen you either spam post or delete and repost tweets for your movie... usually around 30 responses and you nuke it and repost; not liking the generally negative responses/criticisms, hm? Good, because this whole thing is distasteful..."
"3146","Going to see hellboy"
"3147","Hellboy is a huge let down. Everything from the story, to the acting, even the sound design and editing are just not good. Really glad Guillermo got to do his first. 2/10 wouldn't recommend seeing this."
"3148","Currently watching the first Hellboy to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
"3149","@AndrewAllStars @HellboyMovie Occasional one liners but not as much comedy in these, still TONS of action"
"3150","LOVED @HellboyMovie!!!! Exactly what I wanted, huge monsters, lots of blood, and perfect casting! Can’t wait for more!! #abesapien"
"3151","@AndrewAllStars @HellboyMovie Only thing I would watch for is it’s OBSCENE amounts of gore, and some of the plot hooks assume a bit of knowledge but if you pay attention it’s not hard to keep up with."
"3152","@AndrewAllStars @HellboyMovie It’s a love letter to fans of the franchise. If you aren’t “in” then I could see not liking it"
"3153","Apparently the new Hellboy is very bad and that’s... upsetting to hear"
"3154","@AgentBigfoot Exactly.  I’m aware they aren’t “good”.  They are pure schlock and great late night silliness.  Hellboy fits that a bit."
"3155","Someone said that Hellboy is tandoori red and now I can’t unsee it. How am I supposed to enjoy my chicken tandoori like this??!!!"
"3156","I had low expectations for the hellboy movie but damn... that was ass"
"3157","So I just watched HellBoy and gotta say I was left very unsatisfied, David Harbour was amazing as HellBoy and Mila Jovovich was lovely as The Blood Queen but...eh, the movie was very eh. If you have any questions as to why, feel free to ask."
"3158","I respond to trolls in the ensuing 800 tweet ""Hellboy receiving poor initial reviews is NOT ok"" thread with the same gif of myself stroking my purple &amp; blue beard quizzically"
"3159","@patrickhwillems First Hellboy´s soundtrack ft. Tom Waits and Nick Cave was pretty badass too."
"3160","Neil Marshall, director of Hellboy, is from the toon? GTFOH. Well, if he can do it..."
"3161","@DorkKnight_Ryan @HellboyMovie The answer is always “yes”"
"3162","Is that Greene Co Officer related to HellBoy? #LivePD #LivePDNation"
"3163","Hellboy was very disappointing :(
From a viewer standpoint and a vfx point of view... Such bad use of 2D elements!!"
"3164","So I went to see Hellboy today and I saw the trailer for Brightburn... I am very intrigued."
"3165","Hellboy is a stagnant pool of shit"
"3166","Hellboy was just so........ bad.
It looked bad from the trailer but it was much worse than I thought.
It was so bogged down with exposition and plot, they tried to fit like 4 movies worth of plot in 1 film.
Plus the gore was troma level and uncalled for. So gratuitous."
"3167","I’m sooo excited for this movie"
"3168","@actordougjones better be in the next Hellboy or I'm gunna cry <U+0001F62D> #hellboy"
"3169","@perlmutations well you certainly weren't replaced. What a bad job they did to a character you made awesome. My son and i saw you hellboy, then we saw this trainwreck. 

Both of left very bummed."
"3170","The new Hellboy film is currently getting hit in the face with a sledgehammer based on @RottenTomatoes scores. Is it that bad? Let me know what you think. #Hellboy #HellboyMovie #Hellboy2019 #movies"
"3171","Hellboy was a dumb fun perfectly fine movie, definitely a movie I’d put on while all my friends are hanging out half paying attention to! Best movie ever #weeklyplanetpod @mrsundaymovies @wikipediabrown"
"3172","Just saw #Hellboy and it was amazing! Reminded me of my other favorite film that critics didn't understand, #punisherwarzone If you like crazy weird cartoon violence and are a fan of the comics you'll not be disappointed. Don't go in expecting #hellboy2004 and you'll have a blast"
"3173","Very happy I didn’t pay for my ticket to see the new Hellboy and that’s all I’ll say about that."
"3174","Bout to see what that hellboy takin bout"
"3175","So I'm a bit confused. Can someone clear this up for me? The new HELLBOY movie, see it or don't see it? Keep in mind I adore Guillermo del Toro's HELLBOY 2, and the action design in that one is pretty top notch."
"3176","""...the screenplay has the depth and intelligence of a Pantera album cover"" has to be one of the best lines I've read in ages! I'll still go."
"3177","Yeah that #Hellboy movie ain’t gettin a sequel- I’m really open to movies and different takes on things but this was a let down"
"3178","@ShaunTheCHB Fuck the haters; I'm excited!

I don't let the opinions of other people I don't even interact with tell me what movies to see. Aside from the critical consensus I don't care. And even then: I'm still going to see the new Hellboy, even if it's terrible by all accounts."
"3179","I regret to report that I am going to go and spend genuine US dollars to watch Hellboy (2019) in a movie theater now"
"3180","within the span of a few months we have gotten/are getting charlies angels, hellboy &amp; laura croft remakes, what in the fresh early 2000s hell is this"
"3181","Alright. I'm watching Hellboy now. Talk in a few hours."
"3182","@artofmmignola please make this last BPRD have a twist and keep hellboy going forever im not ready <U+0001F62D><U+0001F622><U+0001F622><U+0001F622>"
"3183","so #Hellboy was awesome! Amazingly good effects and fight sequences were killer. Not a perfect film, but a lot of fun! Great creature design."
"3184","hellboy 2019 was some of THE cheesiest, army of darknessiest, corniest horror b movie schlock of this decade its EXACTLY what i wanted i LOVED it critics are HATERS"
"3185","@guitarmag44 @HellboyMovie Needless to say I got a lecture <U+0001F602>"
"3186","wait why are ppl hating on hellboy"
"3187","Dude at concessions: ""...Did you make that sweater?""

Me: ""Yep!""

Dude: ""That's fucking sweet!""

Then we proceeded to chat about Hellboy and Mignola til his order came up. #HellBoy"
"3188","Fuck the haters. @HellboyMovie was AWESOME and extremely faithful to the source material"
"3189","Mood: #Hellboy because I needed that emoji"
"3190","@rrvirdi Eh. I should have anticipated it, I guess, but I was hopeful. I love Hellboy dearly and he deserved better."
"3191","I wasn’t prepared for the disappointment that was Hellboy 2019. And I’m disappointed that I was disappointed. A waste of David Harbour."
"3192","I kind of want to go see it lol"
"3193","#Hellboy is far from perfect. It's got some real pacing and writing issues, but it's exhilarating at times and a lot of fun throughout"
"3194","As much as people are hating on the #Hellboy reboot, I'll say that I enjoy where they're going with it. Structure could use a bit of tweaking, but @DavidKHarbour did a good job. I hope get to see more of the big red guy."
"3195","#Hellboy was super fun! I had a great time. It didn't take itself too seriously and had heart. Awesome effects too!"
"3196","Watched Hellboy and lot of syirik spotted <U+0001F602>, but the story line is quite good."
"3197","@nsvensk82 @DarkHorseComics @artofmmignola That black Hellboy- collection. Do you have a link to where to buy them?"
"3198","Out from work, bout to go to the movies to see @littlethemovie then to the gym to workout. Movies again tomorrow to see @HellboyMovie"
"3199","@HellboyMovie: holy shit was this amazing! Stellar special effects, oceans of blood and gore, tons of epic action, and loads of humor! David Harbour is perfect as the title character, and his badassery brings the film's awesomeness full circle. #Hellboy #actionmoviemavenreviews"
"3200","[whispering to date while watching Hellboy when Hellboy first appears on the screen] That's Hellboy"
"3201","@BiggestBiscuit I wanted to like it. I enjoyed the Hellboy concept and was excited for a reboot. You realize about 20 minutes in that something isn’t right and it snowballs from there but instead of snow it’s a giant poo."
"3202",". @EnchantrxHarper Watching Hellboy (2004) - one of my favorites - the part where Liz (firestarter girl) is out with Agent Meyers and Hellboy is stalking them - and thanks to WhoreSchool all I can think about is how Hellboy is totally violating her freedom and privacy.

Thanks ;)"
"3203","@Yodarules2 @HellboyMovie It’s worth watching.  Twitter is a negative place, it’s funny and bloody."
"3204","@TheRealJEM_5 @HellboyMovie It was good though. Action packed lol, watch it in an IMAX theatre. I saw it today."
"3205","Hellboy is an extremely misunderstood movie and all the critics slamming it have never watched a b movie or had fun"
"3206","@CSpire So much for going to see Hellboy tonight with my friend."
"3207","The Hellboy reboot is an extremely over the top and overly masculine movie in every sense of the word. Just bringing with immature teenage angst, which is pretty much the polar opposite of the comics. Despite the superficial similarities it's not really a good interpretation."
"3208","The new #Hellboy is disappointing. There’s a good movie in there somewhere, written and directed by James Gunn and starring Dave Bautista. The Golden Army is still the best Hellboy by far."
"3209","The Liz Sherman stout beer will be out later this month! Details via @GiganticBrewing —"
"3210","2) The Baba Yaga Revenge Film. There’s a Baba Yaga that wants vengeance on Hellboy. She lives in a walking house that exists in a void and she eats baby stew. It’s an actual actor in a spooky, fully practical costume and they spend the movie crab walking about. She rules"
"3211","WOW. A LOT of thoughts about Hellboy!"
"3212","First of all, it is NOT a good Hellboy movie. Hellboy is simply too gross to look at for 2 hrs and his relationship with Professor Bloom makes no sense at all. This movie is terrible. However, it’s also like 10 other movies and 3 of them are actually kinda spectacular"
"3213","@Teacloc @RottenTomatoes @HellboyMovie Fake News... do your own research and see the show :-) 

Honestly, I have given up on Rotten Tomatoes for things I love. I go anyways and usually the movie doesnt disappoint. They always are off on comic series movies, either dorection.

Rotten Tomatoes is best for indy films tbh"
"3214","Heard that the new Hellboy movie is a proper 0/10. Damn"
"3215","The new hellboy is so weird but enjoyable"
"3216","Hellboy was actually fucking good. Was closer to source material than the originals."
"3217","Saw Hellboy today. It was RAD. I don’t get the poor reviews, unless the critics weren’t expecting to see a demon kill monsters for 2h. I’m so happy. No bug, but I was distracted by a giant demon ripping off some guy’s face so who knows"
"3218","you ever just listen to swmrs and want to drive your car at 100 mph because thats what happens when i listen to hellboy"
"3219","@sluts_guts @perlmutations, the real Hellboy."
"3220","I’ve seen it said this is “the worst comic film ever made” which... really? 

... @TheHadou @TuboWare &amp; I are about to find out for ourselves! <U+0001F602> #Hellboy"
"3221","The Emoji Movie has a better critical score than Hellboy lol"
"3222","hellboy + a basket of chicken wings + double jameson and cranberry"
"3223","The #Hellboy remake is just a steaming pile of horse crap. The team who wrote the script should be forced to burn their Writer’s Guild cards in the public square. Save yourself $20, and just watch the promo trailers to see the whole movie without wasting two hours of your life."
"3224","Hellboy 3 Sorry to report: Spoke w all parties. Must report that 100% the sequel will not happen. And that is to be the final thing about it"
"3225","Welp..I didnt expect Hellboy to get 11% on RT. I wished they still holded out for Hellboy 3 with Del Toro. :("
"3226","The new Hellboy was a solid 7/10 if you disregard that the other two movies exist"
"3227","#Hellboy and #GameOfThrones premiering on the same weekend is exactly what all of us dark fantasy nerds deserve."
"3228","Hellboy was everything I ever wanted and more."
"3229","HELLBOY '19 has what I *think* is a nod to LIFEFORCE. If so that's another notch in its ""pro"" column."
"3230","I'm gonna say minor spoilers at this point:

The main issue I guess would be the creative direction of the organization and Hellboy's dad. In this movie it feels like a swat team with no eccentricities while in the original Hellboy they're full into that mumbo jumbo"
"3231","And instead of cthulu-esque stuff and unimaginable hellish horror they decided to go with European fairytale mythology (I don't know all the stuff that's in the comics but I assume they exist in that universe) which is fine! Not every Hellboy story has to do deep deep horror"
"3232","Just saw Hellboy and in confused why people are saying it's unimaginative. Sure it isn't Del Toro's Hellboy but they did some creative stuff in this one and there were great (AND HORRIBLY GRAPHIC) visuals

They did different stuff, big deal"
"3233","The new Hellboy makes me sad. In some ways it gets CLOSE to fun, but for me, it feels like it thinks gore and swearing is personality."
"3234","Well, hellboy is a piece of crap. Bad acting, bad plot, bad FX, bad bad bad. If you want to know how bad, watch golden army, but shut your nuts in a drawer before you go"
"3235","btw hellboy turned out horrible"
"3236","@Sturgeons_Law I remember that around the time the second Hellboy movie came out both Mignola and del Toro separately identified Beauty and the Beast as a formative movie. (I wish Hellboy reflected that influence.)"
"3237","I give the new #Hellboy movie 2.5 out of 5 <U+2B50><U+FE0F>s. It had its moments but ultimately fell a little short. I did think @DavidKHarbour did an awesome job playing Big Red though. I hope they make a second one and fix the bad areas. It definitely has potential."
"3238","So like Hellboy is my favorite comic series, and Hellboy 2 is probably top 5 favorite movies, I still have zero desire to see that new movie"
"3239","Also @DavidKHarbour as Hellboy was a huge crush of mine in my formative years. Along with @RealHughJackman as Wolverine."
"3240","Husband and I went to see the new Hellboy movie - it was... entertaining. Very bloody, although it’s cheesy cgi bloody. But generally the humor was pretty great."
"3241","@Hinje_ @HellboyMovie I'll definetly give it a watch, but i feel i'll wait till i've read up on it!
With that in mind i'm really glad you enjoyed it dude! Hope tomorrow goes well with the LoL event. Keep me updated and take some photos!"
"3242","@Hinje_ @HellboyMovie End of the day. It might be one of those films......you know.
Low critic ratings but highly loved by a fanbase and an audience? 
I might consider it over next weekend. I've got a girl visiting me so it could be an option? You think?"

"3248","@FreddyInSpace I saw it yesterday and honestly thought it was the most fun I've had in the cinema this year. What kind of person actually gets mad about Hellboy fighting a Mexican vampire in a wrestling match?"
"3249","Time to see if this Hellboy movie is any good."
"3250","Sadly it was kinda disappointing.
If you're going to rewrite his whole backstory, at least make it better or more interesting..."

"3256","Seems #Hellboy is #Venom all over again with the critics giving it a hard time but many peopl who've seen it loved it. Makes me wanna see it even more now. Cant wait for tomorrow!"

"3275","I saw Hellboy today. I didn't care about it at first but wound up enjoying it. You can't compare it to Del Toro's two films though. Completely different in every way."

"3282","@missfors Aha, of all pics, they used the Bones of Giants pic. But yes I was kinda guessing that he was probably (inside) happier to have this version of Hellboy out. Guillermo would probably not have had it this close to the comics."
"3283","Should be lower."
"3284","@IMAX @HellboyMovie Nothing but shit shows coming out of Hollywood.  I think they’re all possessed and need an exorcism."

<U+0001F538><U+FE0F> Source music for too many scenes (""GOTG it up"")
<U+0001F538><U+FE0F> Ridiculous excess of exposition (needs a Blade Runner style No Voiceover edit)
<U+0001F538><U+FE0F> Scenes left on cutting room floor bc of above"

So glad Wordgirl: The Rise of Miss Power is on Family Night tonight. Need to watch something good."

"3444","Saw #Hellboy yesterday. It definitely delivered a lot of awesome moments. Great one liners, killer action. But the overall story suffered. Lots of plot points that you were assumed to know from comics, no real character arcs, and the pacing didn't allow anything any real impact."

"3458","Which is a long way of saying that seeing Hellboy '19 basically getting railed is depressing and I kind of wished better for it. I'm not as hung up on the GDT-less of it all, but it does remind me of why I hold the other one to such high regard."
"3459","Back in 2004, I was burned out on superhero movies and felt like there was no point anymore. It wasn't until I saw Hellboy that I felt like there was limitless potential. The humor, artistry, characters... it made me fascinated by the genre again, and I thank it so much for that."
"3460","With that said, I have really liked superhero movies every year since 2008, but there's only three that go above and beyond for me: Hellboy '04, The Dark Knight, and Spider-Man 2.

"3521","@Kenman_RiderW @arianaxebel @evanmedinis @HellboyMovie i feel snyder could make a good dc movie if he wasn’t held back from created what he wanted. that’s usually what happens with a lot of these movies that go to shit. but i do agree that shazam still ended up to be better than this corny dark shit they’ve put out."

"3523","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Chaotic, tons of exposition, funny, boring, predictable, incoherent soundtrack, R-rated just for the sake of R-rating ... a mess . However, David Harbour and Milla Jovovich were great. But couldn't save the cluster fuck of a movie. Shame<U+0001F61E>"
"3524","Hello everyone, just saw the new @HellboyMovie. Look for my review coming out in the next couple days"
"3525","@jesseflo @HellboyMovie @IMAX @MillaJovovich It’s big action and not great storyline, but fun nonetheless. Felt like it was trying so hard to be funny, but never quite landed the laughs. Not a bad reboot, but still enjoy the Pearlman movies better."
"3526","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Rated R. Did we say it was Rated R... hey, have you heard it’s R rated, oh by the way, it’s rated R for strong bloody violence... R RATED... is this all the marketing team had to work with. I’d see this if it was a PG... just make a good fucking movie regardless of rating"
"3527","Just waiting to see #HellboyMovie"
"3528","@BBAD777 @HellboyMovie I’ll definitely see it at some point."

"3539","Oh btw we went to see the new @HellboyMovie last Thursday (Matt is a longtime fan of the comics and Del Toro movies) and WOW what a mess. The editing/soundtrack/production was all over the place and the character development/writing was absolute shit."
"3540","@HellboyMovie Ya but @perlmutations did it better"
"3541","@HellboyMovie @acmilan wtaf is this"
"3542","@SceneInvaders @HellboyMovie I would have thought that a story from comic so rich with depth and originality would... rely on story and the fantasy fight scenes would just be icing on the tombstone."

"3547","@HellboyMovie Ill give David credit. He tried his best"
"3548","So, @HellboyMovie was pretty fucking good. Really enjoyed it.
Bit darker/gorier than the @RealGDT movies (which is not to say I do not love those movies - especially the first one)."
"3549","@hellboy_news Well I think the site has always been a bad thing and it does seem that some movies seem to get dog piled in some kind of odd hate for movies that are actually not bad at all All I can say for sure is I loved the new Hellboy I loved the old Hellboy and pitty people who rely on RT"
"3550","@PamRobins3 @hellboy_news I agree I mean I love the Del Toro movies Hellboy 2 is my favorite comic book movie ever, but I went and saw this new one and had a ball the girl I went and saw it with had a blast I really don't get the hate for the movie at all"
"3551","@ProfPentzer @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour Well, supernatural abilities are a pretty quick way in. I had been looking at government jobs though and I think the #BPRD caught my scent."
"3552","@ancientlyric @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour I hope so! I'm ready for Nazis. Not so sure about giants, but hopefully things will start out as a desk job."
"3553","@hectorexafm @RealGDT @HellboyMovie @perlmutations I watched it last night and it still remains Del Toro's signature and the movie didn't was as awesome as the other two..."
"3554","@RealGDT I'm about to watch the new @HellboyMovie tonight. You and @perlmutations raised the bar so high!"
"3555","So I watched Hellboy... I'm conflicted. At the base, the script was just not strong enough. Performances were strong but the cast worked very hard to hold my interest.

This just kills me writing this. The VFX are good but honestly without more story you say ok so?"
"3556","@HellboyMovie No, as an adult I live in a litte more reality"
"3557","I believe it"
"3558","Everything I wanted to see in the #HellboyMovie I got to see. It was awesome to see so many storylines jump off the page. The main characters are all changed a bit but I liked the tone. Nimue had a bit of Hecate in her which I thought was great. Will watch again."

If you love the lore and world of Hellboy and want the most insane monster romp you could ever get into theaters across america, its worth a sit. Thank you @artofmmignola @DavidKHarbour Neil Marshall @danieldaekim @SashaBianca23"
"3562","@PencesAngryEyes @IMAX @HellboyMovie @perlmutations @RealGDT Its co written by Mignola, but it's still not worth it. At all."
"3563","@LightHunter5 @HellboyMovie Sad thing is, he said he would've, but no one contacted him"
"3564","The new #HellboyMovie is awful. Poor CGI, pacing issues and unlikable characters. #sticktotheoriginal"
"3565","@ColdDeadMeme @HellboyMovie He probably wouldn't have been able to do it as well as before just because of his age.
I think @perlmutations did have a cameo though."

"3570","@Dan_Crampton @HellboyMovie I’ve just said the same to Lisa ... the fight scene with the giants was clearly done with green screen and obvious... hope abe sapient brings the team in the next"
"3571","@Have_Geek @HellboyMovie @DarkHorseComics That’s exactly what I’m expecting when I see it."
"3572","@ComicBookNOW @shadowofthevale Loved the movie. It was great. David Harbour made a great Hellboy. What saddens me is these tomato people were so way off &amp; I don’t really understand why. How did they give it such a low score? Critics’ comments didn’t match anything I saw, again can’t understand why. What’s up?"
"3573","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Saw the movie today. Absolutely loved it. Definitely worth seeing. I think something is wrong with the tomato meter &amp; something is wrong with the reviews because what I saw was nothing close to what the meter showed &amp; the critics said-Best to be your own critic &amp; see for yourself"
"3574","@JohnnyAlpha81 @hellboy_news Dont get it either. It’s been 11 yrs. It was time to move on to a new direction. They do it with all other movies-Why wouldn’t they allow it with Hellboy? I’ll never get it. Unfortunately for Hellboy fans if it does poorly in box office HB will stay stuck on the pgs of the comics"
"3575","Welp, @HellboyMovie ain’t great. Tonally and atmospherically, it’s on point. There’s just a shabbiness to the plot and some clunkiness that screams studio notes. Also: probably suffers from adapting what was an endgame storyline as a reboot. Still, “I Love You, Lobster Johnson!”"
"3576","@SashaBianca23 I loved @HellboyMovie it was pefect from start to end :)"
"3577","@rrvirdi Saw Hellboy, it was pure awful

Then came home and recorded some episodes for the channel

And I figure the rest of the night will be FFXV"

"3580","I’m enjoying @HellboyMovie as what it is."
"3581","a completely graceless movie with a killer soundtrack 

David Harbour rocks though."
"3582","#HellboyMovie is a movie with good actors doing their best with a terrible script.  The editing and pacing are all over the place.  Save your money, go watch the @RealGDT movies, the 2 animated films and read the @DarkHorseComics, you'll have a far more enjoyable time."
"3583","@PhillyRunsDeep @mamayambili @HellboyMovie Depends on your level of comedy, on a scale of minion memes to cards against humanity (1 to 10) where are you at?"
"3584","Hopefully @HellboyMovie isn’t terrible. I really like Harbour as an actor. I’m pretty sure I didn’t spell his name right though."
"3585","@HellboyMovie I love when people judge a movie based o Rotten Tomatoes critic reviews. Go see the damn movie for yourself then make a decision on how  good/ bad a movie is. Half the times critics are wrong anyway."
"3586","Exactly!! We love ya man!! You did an amazing job!! @DavidKHarbour"

"3590","@codyschibi @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour @artofmmignola @Lionsgate I saw it Thursday night and really enjoyed it. The apocalyptic creature mayhem in the latter part of the movie made this horror fan very happy!"

"3592","@ThatGuyYus @IMAX @HellboyMovie @perlmutations @RealGDT Sounds like yet another reason to avoid it.

I'm almost at the ""never-watch and boycott"" stage with this film.

Thank you!"

"3595","THIS NEW @HellboyMovie is freaking awesome"
"3596","@FlavianSophist @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour I am super jealous. How does one encounter such a job to fill it in the first place?"
"3597","@HellboyMovie I liked the movie pretty much.  Most of the review gotta be for nostalgia thing just because they missed Ron Perlman"
"3598","@Dyslogix @perlmutations <U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923><U+0001F923> Which the critics are panning like mad. Ron Perlman is THE HellBoy."
"3599","Just got out of #HellboyMovie and I gotta say 10/10 amazing honestly did the original 2 justice I'm looking forward to the sequel. The reviews @IGN and people gave it are so stupid. Its not as bad as people say. See it for yourself"
"3600","Saw #HellboyMovie because of @TMobile. Thank you because I probably wouldn’t have seen it. The movie was not what I expected or perfect but enjoyable."
"3601","@jotunthrash666 @BDisgusting @HellboyMovie Which is hilarious cause I wrote my positive review... on Twitter.

Our review on site is 2 1/2 stars."
"3602","We just saw the new @HellboyMovie it was fairly entertaining but a tad gory and more than slightly unnecessary.  6/10"
"3603","@jotunthrash666 @BDisgusting @HellboyMovie I'll guarantee that just for the attention you'll post dumb nonsense about a professional website because you hate the idea of people enjoying things."

"3606","@SashaBianca23 saw HellBoy and it was very nice seeing you in it! Love your work"
"3607","@CriticallyTouch @leon_woodley No worries, no one is consistently correct. If 10 of us made 10 different predictions, some of would be correct, some of us would be wrong. 

I haven’t watched #HellboyMovie yet but look forward to seeing David Harbour return in #StrangerThings Season 3 though :)"
"3608","@jotunthrash666 @BDisgusting @HellboyMovie Who are you again? Been following BD for years. I don't always agree with their reviews, but their articles are far from clickbait. You sound like a jilted writer they didn't hire"
"3609","@MIIICHAELsv @arianaxebel @evanmedinis @HellboyMovie And the most comic accurate movie to date. Literally 98% of that movie is taken right from the comicbook"
"3610","@MIIICHAELsv @arianaxebel @evanmedinis @HellboyMovie Better then those fuckin over the top dark dc movies Snyder made . Cheesy light hearted silver age super hero tone is what dc really needs. The last great fun  dc movie was Superman Returns ."
"3611","@HellboyMovie Walked out in the middle of the movie. Who did the soundtrack for this movie? God awful."
"3612","@JsmallSAINTS @HellboyMovie The original films are good with Pearlman but the new one was horrific"
"3613","So, I saw #Hellboy today.
This movie is what happens when you try to put WAY too much content into one film. And also the disagreements behind the scenes are abundantly obvious.
It’s fun to riff at with friends and laugh but other then that...oof."
"3614","The fact that @perlmutations isn’t gloating about being right about the #Hellboy reboot right tells you all how much of the bigger man he is.
If it were me I’d be laughing my ass off and ‘I told you so’ing so hard."

"3628","@perlmutations you are the only true Hellboy!"
"3629","I don't care how bad the reviews are. I'm seeing this thing. I am a simple creature; I want to see some ugly monsters, I want to see Hellboy fight some ugly monsters, and I'm /very/ curious about this version of Major Daimio."

"3634","@MillaJovovich Dont know why the reviews are so negative. It was a decent hellboy movie. I enjoyed it. My only complaint was the music and music volume was distracting.  But acting and action were good."

"3653","HELLBOY: Oof. An incomprehensible disaster that wants to have GOTG’s swagger/song choices and DEADPOOL’s irreverence/hard-R violence, but is more Bay’s TRANSFORMERS with juvenile humor that dies on impact and awful CGI characters on par with the shitty racist robots."

"3689","Loved #HellboyMovie want to watch it again"
"3690","Hellboy is better than the reviews make it out to be. It’s an OK movie. The pacing is weird in it, too many origin stories, acting was solid, monster design and fights were great, it’s smaller budget was apparent for what it wanted to do though."

"3692","imagine you release a hellboy movie in between a dc and marvel movie and a pokémon live action film and a seth roger movie and even a movie about kid regina hall outgrosses it"

"3694","Hellboy is a convoluted mess. A fun mess, like Suicide Squad, but a mess none the less. All over the place. Also good example of just because you made a more accurate adaptation, doesn't necessarily mean you made a better movie. Loved the humor, action and gore though."

"3702","The internet has me pissed off over the new Hellboy reviews. How many of you assholes actually read the comics?
What kind of ass backwards fuckery is this? 
I also feel I shouldn't be surprised by the trolls trying to ruin shit they have no idea about."
"3703","@ShaquilleAKhan @HellboyMovie Only reason we saw it after we saw @ShazamMovie, which was great"
"3704","@JonSteinhagen According to reviews, you're going to LOVE Hellboy then"
"3705","Sixth: it's way different from the previous Hellboy movies, they are comparable and have pretty much some identical moments that work better in Del Toro's movies, but it's better if you watch this movie as it's own movie"
"3706","Fifth: it is no masterpiece and it doesn't compare to Del Toro's version, but i do recommend it if you want some hardcore Hellboy on monster action"
"3707","Watched the new #Hellboy movie on opening night. There was exactly 12 people including my pals and the movie sucked so much ass, we regretted the 11$ we spent each on tix"
"3708","@H_Alokaily2 I can’t imagine having to wait an extra 45 mins for #Hellboy to start. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FC><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> I would’ve been even more pissed at how bad the movie sucked."
"3709","@H_Alokaily2 #Hellboy was awful. I wanted to leave the theater halfway through, but it was pouring the rain outside. lol"
"3710","@MontyHD @JsmallSAINTS @HellboyMovie Yes opening day"
"3711","@bort_mc Nobody.  Everyone wanted to do Hellboy 3... but they didn't want to do it that badly..."
"3712","Reral Movie News: Shazam should be #1. Hellboy (with no Del Toro) only about $13m. Little ($15m) and After($8m) are both going to end up making money eventually so those numbers are not bad. Missing Link animation style is very cool but fails to catch on in US and will do $6m"
"3713","@MNJarvis I havent checked the evening numbers but I beleive it. Because of the low national print count it is hard to tell. I have seen many towns where After has doubled Hellboy."
"3714","@AirlineFlyer @HellboyMovie I hope
You took advantage of the $4 Tmo offer"
"3715","@BWTex @HellboyMovie I would never have seen it anyway, but good to know I'm not missing out.  I do want to go see Shazam with my son, I think that will be a fun movie."
"3716","I mean: Vampires, A Gargantuan Walking house with a Hag named ""Baba YAGA""
Hellboy staff just played on film their CoS campaign. They used the bestiary section and said: HMMM GOT IT"

"3718","Here to see Hellboy #Hellboy"
"3719","This movie lacks the charm of the Guillermo del Toro duology, this 2019 #Hellboy is just another failed reboot that tried to be anything but itself, the CGI was overused, acting was too flat, plot was nonexistent, not too bad, not good either.

I’d rate it 5/10. #Hellboy"
"3720","This would have been done hours ago but Nick decided he wanted to go see Hellboy."
"3721","I seriously considered walking out of Hellboy, I was that frustrated by it."
"3722","Hellboy review:

Everything about the movie is horrible, there’s one somewhat entertaining action scene and David Harbour tries his best, those are the only pros I can give this god forsaken movie.

There’s so much gore to a fault, it’s unbelievably disturbing and graphic"
"3723","I swear to fucking god if you ruin the Hellboy fanbase with this Snyder-fanatic conspiracy shit... this movie was rightfully slammed by critics for being a pile of shit. No one had it out for this movie"
"3724","I'm a play dis hellboy tape full blast  smoke this cigarette and call it a day <U+270C>"
"3725","That new Hellboy movie is absolute crap. Holy shit."
"3726","@WhisenhuntRob @CC_the_martian They still can.

We’re getting Ghostbusters 3 and Robocop 4 after those failed reboots.

Do it, @Lionsgate.  Give us that @HellboyMovie 3 we ACTUALLY wanted directed by @RealGDT."
"3727","@BWTex @HellboyMovie Yeah there was really no reason to make it lol. 
Ever see the 2004 version? Pretty badass."
"3728","I really, really loved the new #Hellboy I don’t know why it has such a low score on IMDb"
"3729","@BWTex @HellboyMovie So the critics were right. I saw where this had a 9% rotten tomatoes score"
"3730","@HellboyMovie Okay. For those who’ve seen it, how and did it suck?"
"3731","@MIIICHAELsv @arianaxebel @evanmedinis @HellboyMovie That’s your problem, buddy."
"3732","Hellboy blew all expectations, loved every second of it"
"3733","Happy Birthday to the ONLY Hellboy!! PS- you are a year younger than my mother.......hahaha. Be safe on a Saturday night bday @perlmutations"
"3734","Hold the phone. Millennium Films produced Hellboy? You mean, the same Millennium Films headed by Avi Lerner, accused of multiple counts of sexual harassment, who tried to hire Bryan Singer for Red Sonja? And we're not happy with the film being dragged by RT?!"
"3735","Did she somehow forget Dazed and Confused got positive reviews?"
"3736","The Guillermo del Toro Hellboy still holds up. I was lucky enough to see it in theaters and even the get the 2 Disc DVD. It was my first full on exposure to the works of @RealGDT and I loved the character since. Thank you, GDT!"
"3737","Please go see #Hellboy this weekend so that cool sc-fi movie like this keep getting made. I get it, I wish it was Ron Pearlman too but more Hellboy is always good and the monsters look cool and please god let this movie do well *praying emoji cuz I don't have one*"
"3738","I liked the new Hellboy. The perfect Hellboy probably lies somewhere between this and the GDT ones."
"3739","For what it's worth, HELLBOY (2019) had the second-best giant (i.e. actual giants) fight sequence I saw in the multiplex this week."
"3740","Hellboy is literally THE WORST fucking movie I ever seen holyshit"
"3741","@fenil_seta Which is sad because this version of hellboy is the closest comic book adaptation.. The earlier one was OK"
"3742","@RobertParizek @DMRawlings Ooooohh right. I remember now. I also remember laughing my butt off about that. Such a terrible movie. Just wretched. No Hellboy wasn't that bad. Close but not that bad."
"3743","Guess I will wait till it hits Netflix"
"3744","@SpotScourge that #Hellboy ....ouch...I'll rewatch any OC loss before that flick..."
"3745","@fenil_seta the collection was india specific ? i doubt many people know hellboy and the comics that come with it .."
"3746","@m_weer90 I’ve heard bad things about Hellboy... sucks because I love the character"
"3747","Reviews are in for the new Hellboy movie and they are not great. I'm not sure if I'm going to see it or not."

The end credits are a visual nightmare"

The Heavy D thing came out of nowhere ( no pun intended ) but it works. lmao"
"3752","Well, I liked it. Don't know why others are getting their panties in a bunch over it.
#Hellboy"
"3753","New game: Make a movie marathon
Three movies, they cannot be from the same franchise.  Each one has to be a semi logical sequel to the previous one.
1.  Hellboy (2004)
2.  Cabin in the Woods
3.  Cloverfield

1.  Deep Blue Sea
2.  Finding Nemo
3.  The Shape of Water"

"3764","@siegsnark I wish I knew, but I haven’t seen either of the hellboy movies and i need to watch the original, this is more of a question for the extreme comic book nerds"

"3766","I'd vote for Hellboy in a HEARTBEAT! I LOVE @perlmutations"

"3768","@perlmutations How'd you get so lucky 
Hellboy?"
"3769","@cmckendry it's not a GDT film, it's a metal as hell movie about a demon guy who likes animals

a lot of human beings get brutally dismembered

it's p rad to be honest. the worst part about it is no Abe. and they gave Hellboy back hair.  BACK HAIR!  THE HUMANITY"
"3770","Hey Hellboy 2019, thank you for putting Lobster Johnson in a movie. Eeehh... you can keep the rest of... that."
"3771","@DavidKHarbour just saw Hellboy. I was really worried because I loved the first 2 movies. You nailed it. So happy we could still see acting under the makeup. Really hope there is a sequel."
"3772","@TrashCanDanpt3 <U+0001F602> Hellboy is probably the most attractive of these two options. Definitely expecting to get rolled by a high-schooler with a trolley handlebar in hand."
"3773","for those of you wondering, the new Hellboy is gory and horrific and wonderful and 1000000% worth seeing. @DavidKHarbour knocked it out of the park"

"3775","Hey guys; if you liked Venom def go see Hellboy. It's not the DT version, but the only major issue we had was pacing, I WANT TO SEE MORE HELLBOY and I def want to see Daimio and Alice again too!"
"3776","@nosliwhtes I loved it. I mean it’s not gonna be for everyone that’s for sure. If you go in not expecting Hellboy 3 and don’t compare it to the Del Toro movies you’ll be fine. Just a monster action bash."
"3777","@HellboyMovie Rotten tomatoes ruins movies! Was this the best movie I’ve ever seen? No! Was it a blast to sit through HELL YEAH!! This had me laughing and hyped throughout the entire movie!! Fuck movie snobs! Don’t miss out on a good time! Beer...friends...AND HELLBOY!! <U+0001F919>"

Like literally out of the comic."
"3783","Hellboy, solid movie. Good for old fans and a good way for new fans to see the franchise (like me)"
"3784","@deathjawinc @HellboyMovie Bro this movie is a hard to watch mess"
"3785","@cosmologicalboi @HellboyMovie They spent more time writing the gore scenes than they did the actual movie"
"3786","@HellboyMovie was unnecessary! @RealGDT &amp; @perlmutations should have done a Part 3 instead. Waste of time &amp; money. I probably would have loved it if I was 13 years old. I want a refund!"
"3787","Hellboy was unneeded, really edgy and had some really bad CGI

However

It was incredibly campy, didn't take itself seriously, and was am incredibly enjoyable movie

Plus it had a lot of semi naked furry dudes"
"3788","Bitch we’re going idc ! @Thegr8Tavo"
"3789","She remains aspirational for me."
"3790","I haven't seen HELLBOY of course so I'm not talking about it but she's kicked ass in a lot of movies that have flat out blown. I love her dearly. Her response here is the way I hope to be if I ever do anything for public consumption: THAT'S SHOW BIZ! <U+0001F603>"
"3791","do i watch hellboy for beautiful monsters or shazam for siblings or captain marvel so i can carry out my obligations to know what’s occurring in comics land"
"3792","@HellboyMovie Disappointing really . I'm bummed ."
"3793","@cultjer @LCJReviews It’s been my favorite of the Hellboy movies. Of course people hate it."
"3794","@cvw220 I saw Shazam!, Missing Link, Little, and Hellboy this week. They were all pretty good."
"3795","Idk why Hellboy got such bad reviews. Like it's a pretty alright movie."
"3796","TIL that Milla Jovovich is in the new bad Hellboy movie."
"3797","Did not expect to like #Hellboy as much as I did lol.

Lots of action. Lots of monsters.

Aka exactly what I wanted <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FE><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"3798","@noroshu @AyeImJulius So I actually kinda liked it compared to the others but that might be because I haven’t seen those in awhile. It kinda jumped around but that was okay. I liked the new hellboy that was really what I was worried about tbh"
"3799","@TessFowler Just got home and it was great! Very glad to have seen @HellboyMovie Thanks again for pushing me off the fence."
"3800","@DavidKHarbour FABULOUS job as Hellboy! Super fun movie with great BPRD comics references and attitude! <U+0001F496>"
"3801","It's got a lot of cool monster designs and action sequences, but the writing, directing, and most of all the editing pale in comparison to the del Toro films, making this one that will sadly live on only in their shadow. #Hellboy"
"3802","3. Baba yaga. I dont know the person portaying this char, but they couldnt get a better contortionist? Yall fucked that up. 4. Every other char. The guy who shot hellboy and said ""my bad, sorry"" delivered that line wrong and it became not funny."
"3803","and stereotypical or in other cases not drawn out enough. Like they didnt know what they were doin except for with Hellboy, and even then they fucked him over abit.
-when scenes go from a dark color scheme to a bright one in a flash. It hurts my eyes u fucks. And it happens ALOT"
"3804","He was so skeptical and then at the end o the movie, almost in a blink of an eye he was ok with hellboy. Makes no sense. Even xmen understood that.
-Lionsgate. The only good movies they did was Saw 1 and John Wick. Stop doin things. pass the hellboy story to someone else."
"3805","-the blood queen wanting to just marry hellboy. Like she couldnt do anything without a man by her side &amp; that demon/satan D got her quaking. SHE COULD HAVE DONE THE DAMN APOCALYPSE BY HERSELF. but nah, need that D. Again, they wrote her so damn bad, reminds me of Ghostrider tbh"
"3806","for how he looks and his teen-angst with his dad person. 
-the fact that Hellboy so quickly went to ""the dark side"". In the comics and even in the older movies you get to see him fight with himself over good and evil and hatred from all sides, including his self hatred."
"3807","They were written badly and too quickly.
-the cgi baby hellboy. This gets its own category, even tho i know i should put it in with the cgi section."
"3808","He is better in badass roles. Professor Broom is an expert on the occult, a director of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, NOT ASSASSIN/KILLER, &amp; is a huge father figure to hellboy. hes soft &amp; strong. John Hurt (RIP) was PERFECT in this role Itsa shame he passed away"
"3809","Hellboy sucked.

Don’t watch it. Save your money and time."
"3810","Just got back from #HellboyMovie and while it wasn't perfect, I don't see where all these terrible reviews are coming from. Seems like a bit much, folks. They for sure killed this movie on arrival."
"3811","Also some people are saying #HellboyMovie will one day be a cult classic which just makes me want to defend it even more."
"3812","@LorettaTay @HellboyMovie Both have their merits. But I think acting wise original one from Del Toro is better. This new version is very gory and show some very gruesome deaths."
"3813","@joleeqh Its was not bads. But I have to admit, every time #MillaJovovich appears, I have to immediately remind myself this is not #ResidentEvil Lol the new #HellBoy is the dude from #StrangerThings is not bad but I think #RonPerlman acting expressions are still better."
"3814","just watched Hellboy and wow Rotten Tomatoes was really generous with their 15% rating"
"3815","Definitely don’t agree with people’s opinions one #HellboyMovie it was actually amazing and I’m hoping there is another!"
"3816","The new hellboy was good. People can’t enjoy a movie anymore because they love the old one."
"3817","Went to see #HellboyMovie yesterday, such a shit movie"
"3818","Put on the original Hellboy movies while I did some research and the scene with Abe and Hellboy drinking is still endlessly delightful."
"3819","Im strongly considering getting a Hellboy tattoo sleeve, but i want the style to resemble the comic, not the movie actors. Or i will do the tattoo on/around my forearm and leace the upper arm open for something else?? Idk. I'll have to think about it,  i cant afford it now anyway"
"3820","@Sideshow_Bill @cevangelista413 For a second I thought you were replying to my post about Hellboy and I was thinking ""is he trolling me??"" Hahaha"
"3821","Walked out of Hellboy. It was just bad. I feel bad for not liking it. Don’t want to bash it. Del toro is close to my heart and this just made me want to watch his Hellboy movies instead."
"3822","@bradmiska @FreddyInSpace @jotunthrash666 @BDisgusting @HellboyMovie If it was for clicks you’d hire Honeycutt to guest write a piece on 666 Things To Do With The Right Hand of Doom."
"3823","Spoilerish question because this is still really nagging me: If, with this version/timeline of the character, Hellboy didn't know until recently that Dr. Broom was on that Nazi island to try to kill him... where did he *think* he came from?"
"3824","@DavidKHarbour made an excellent Hellboy! Funny and terrifying too!"
"3825","Hellboy reviews coming in are making me sad, but also, confirm my theory that everything Mila Jovovich touches is trash <U+261D><U+FE0F>"
"3826","I liked #HellBoy so much! It felt like every essence of a comic book in a film. The dark humor and angst was awesome!"
"3827","Ended up only seeing Hellboy, but that’s ok because we would have both fallen asleep through Pet Sematary."
"3828","@moira_hawthorne I more assumed Hellboy would fall in love with your kitty"
"3829","@GraceRandolph 
Hi Grace,
How are u?
I just saw Hellboy...Oh god that Movie <U+0001F3A5> is Awful,
Piece of S**t Movie <U+0001F3A5>That I have seen so far this year,
The 1st Two Hellboy Film’s <U+0001F39E> are way better,
Bad acting in this Reboot! <U+0001F620><U+2639><U+FE0F><U+0001F620>"
"3830","I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, Hellboy can GET ITT"
"3831","the new HELLBOY has more in common with TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT than it does with either of del Toro’s movies."
"3832","@Drumdums Never had any urge to see it - LOVED the first Hellboy movie, didn't see this being even close to as fun. I think I'll wait for Netflix for this one <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"3833","Hellboy was trash. I hate unnecessary gore in movies. Kills it."
"3834","@Reid_Actually so, Hellboy, it was enjoyable. Different than the two with Ron Perlman, including the tone, but still good in my opinion. Story about a boy and his dad, and trust between friends/family."
"3835","@perlmutations Perlman will always be The Hellboy."
"3836","@perlmutations Hellboy 15 % Rotten Tomatoes....Justice!"
"3837","If my life had a rotten tomatoes score it would be the same as Hellboy’s"

"3839","I have seen a lot of movies in my life and Hellboy was, without a doubt, one of them"
"3840","I was going to see the new hellboy movie this weekend, but ended up renting the crimes of grindelwald."
"3841","Man Hellboy was great! Don't believe the critics. Sure it's no marvel spectacle but it's better than anything I've seen from DC. It's violent and bloody but it's a fun ride!"
"3842","Saw Hellboy today. Not sure why all the hate. Fun movie. Sometimes people need to remember to have fun in life and let go."
"3843","@MikeyIacono__ Last person in credits of #Hellboy you are."
"3844","Hellboy has to be one of the goriest movies I have ever seen <U+0001F915>"
"3845","@HellboyMovie @IMAX Went and saw it today. It was amazing. Far better than the original, closer to the comics and hoping for a sequel for sure. Great film. Might go see it again tomorrow"
"3846","The new hellboy is THE WORST movie I’ve seen in a minute."
"3847","I like how even the reviews couldn’t save Shazam from having meh box office. 

It would have bombed with Hellboy level reviews."
"3848","@BotEquippedWith No thanks, I already saw Hellboy."
"3849","anyways OG hellboy had 20 cats a hot gf and nachos so who is the real winner?"
"3850","Don't waste your money on the new and Ruined Hellboy movie..it SUCKS...terrible acting  and SICK graphic child murder..just like #PedoWood and #PedoGov"
"3851","Never in a million years did I think I would say “Ron Pearlman is a better actor than ______________” but here we are. Hellboy was physically painful to sit through. I wish I had this ability to sleep in theaters like jack so I could have spared myself the torture"
"3852","@DawiLDanger No not sleeping just tucked into the A.a·bom·i·na·na.ble.ble Bag. dont you like curling up under a fuzzy blanket to watch a good movie? plus Plushie Hellboy called dips on the cupholder. plus it wasnt a traumatic movie so I didnt need to hug anyone tightly."
"3853","@DawiLDanger as much as I love Guillermo and I do! I love his other movies than just Hellboy... and I watch movies/TVseries that Ron Pearlman and Doug Jones act in other than Hellboy... I can also love and enjoy Hellboy with a different crew making it."
"3854","I'm surprised people sticked around of after that car wrecked of Hellboy. #NotWorthWatching"
"3855","I think the closest we’ve ever come to a true comic accurate Hellboy in an adaption is in the two animated films and the apearence in Injustice 2."
"3856","@titathetitanium @AvidGamer9 @HellboyMovie Nooooo it’s good if you don’t be such a movie critic- nvm everyone has their own opinion, I thought it was great <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD> good jump scares (to me) and good comedy, a little gory but whatever"
"3857","Y'all Im so mad at what theyve done to my Hellboy what have you done to Big Red yall come the fuck on"
"3858","The best Hellboy."
"3859","@cathyschaos @actordougjones @perlmutations @SelmaBlair We also noticed that films, that is, the classics began to be killed simply when another leadership appears, Hellboy is definitely not the one who was once!"
"3860","@pixelatedboat @scottEweinberg Theres already been 3 hellboy movies."
"3861","So I actually really liked the new Hellboy, if only becuase it confirms my belief the David Harbour is a national treasure we should cherish."
"3862","@THE_Stefano_DLC No that was definitely part of the fishing simulation like the new HELLBOY movie"
"3863","Spoilers (I guess) (even though it's in the trailer): I love the scene in the new Hellboy where all the demons come out from hell and start killing people in various ways. The demons look amazing. The stuff of nightmares. Horrifying. That's what I wanted to see outta this movie."
"3864","Do not listen to the critics. #Hellboy is amazing. I haven't enjoyed action like that since Dredd."
"3865","They might have given him a different name but I really enjoyed Bebop cameo in Hellboy. #Hellboy #TMNT #Crossover"
"3866","OK OK OK OK I actually didn't hate Hellboy. It was a fun watch. #HellboyMovie"
"3867","#Hellboy and the #BPRD were two series that fostered my love of comics as a medium. I don’t see this movie acting as an entry point to bring new people in."
"3868","I look forward to reading the tell-all behind #Hellboy in around a decade or so. Clearly there was some love involved in there, it’s just something went wrong, it’s just something went wrong along the way."

"3887","Just came back from watching Hellboy, the theater was empty with roughly 10 people including me to watch this film. That's kinda sad. Sorta disappointed with the ending and overall phase of the movie. Needed more demon screentime and less flashbacks."

"3896","@HellmannsUK You do realise that if you were going for a pop culture reference you should really have gone for Hellboy, for obvious reasons."
"3897","Hellboy had major pacing issues and an over-abundance of obvious CGI. Not good CGI, either. See it if you'd truly like to see the newest incarnation but I think you wouldn't miss anything by passing it by."

"3902","I keep seeing people say Hellboy is the worst comic movie ever. Really? Have you seen Fan4stic? That movie took years off my life. It made me question if I even like movies anymore. Hellboy isn't good but it didn't make me question what am doing with my life."
"3903","Hellboy bald with a mullet. Paid time off in the front, party in the back"

Happy Birthday!"

"3907","@Jinx1981 I was bothered by the trailer. The redband one. I'm not a prude or anything but Hellboy doesn't say fuck every 2.5 seconds. I'm ok with swearing and tons of violence and blood. But I just don't think it fits for this franchise. I will probably so see it though still. lol"
"3908","Mike Mignola is an executive producer on the steaming dumpster fire that is #Hellboy - I’ve literally never seen such a glaring example of a creator misunderstanding THEIR OWN character"

"3924","@ProtoDubs The movie was heavily edited and cut on my local cinema because the theatre wants the movie to be rater 16+ instead 21+ in my country. Still with that cut the movie was below average. Shame though because Davis Harbour make a good rendition of Hellboy."

"3954","Just saw HellBoy. 

I liked the creative ways that extras were brutally murdered but it felt pretty bland and confusing as a story.

"3955","--No spoilers--

Really enjoyed the new hellboy. Really goofy fun. Definitely doesn't have the same flavor as the GDT ones, but made me wanna read the comics just to see how it compares."

"3965","Meant to go see hellboy but couldn't find a good show time. Ended up going to see Master Z: legacy of Ip man. No regrets a great movie"
"3966","Ok, I don't know anymore if there is something wrong with me or everyone else, but I really don't understand why new #Hellboy is disliked so much. It was good, not great maybe, but still good. Even the somewhat mixed tone worked well for the most part."
"3967","Hellboy is going to score in overtime, I can feel it"
"3968","@perlmutations You mean the shit role of Hellboy in the new awful @HellboyMovie was given to some ugly guy who isn't fit to make tea for Ron."

I’ll be giving my hopes random drug tests rom now on. 

I could smell the foul stench of producer/director conflict all the way through. 
       Everyone on the screen and bringing the creatures to life were badass."
"3980","Also heard that they tried to cram in a bunch of Hellboy stories from the comics into 2 hours worth of footage which isn't really a good idea cuz it usually ends up being a mess and unfocused since was the issue with BvS."
"3981","But wait there has to be another way to enjoy Hellboy......oh right read the goddamn comics ya dingus!"
"3982","@Nwmentality Girl no, you're like milla jovovich in hellboy, a hot witch."
"3983","Hellboy in Hell is one of the most visually stimulating books I’ve ever read. Such trippy scenery that I can understand why some people say this universe just wouldn’t work in live action. Mignola’s art style is truly one of a kind."
"3984","One further thing I would add, the removal of Professor Broom’s and Hellboy’s Christian faith left the narrative shallow and meaningless. We never get a compelling reason for how Hellboy overcomes his nature. A very disappointing film."
"3985","We just saw Hellboy 2. Hubby and I agreed the first one is better."

"3989","Please on all things holy, do not make the mistake of going to see Hellboy. O Lord, everybody that played a part in putting that 'thing' together should be flogged."
"3990","Just finished watching Hellboy just now. The graphic, storyline, actors are very good. 
But i strongly believe that the director should included more background story and hire a better background narrator. His voice and pace just not add up with the movie. 

Overall 7/10"
"3991","I feel bad for the cast and crew of the Hellboy movie. They had an uphill battle with a shitty director and a legacy to live up to weighing them down. It's Amazing Spider-Man all over again. Great cast, squandered potential."
"3992","Fell asleep half way during #HellBoy and I can proudly say I’ve completed all qualifications to be a dad all I need now is to fall in love, get a house, get a stable career and have a kid <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>"
"3993","@MIIICHAELsv @Kenman_RiderW @arianaxebel @evanmedinis @HellboyMovie What didn't you like about the ending? You mean the fight? Or the end credits?"
"3994","@Avalanche Cole, Brassard and Zadorov are The Dumb of the Dumb on that team. Swear. More brains exsist with the Writers Of 2019 HellBoy."
"3995","@SchoolOfMovies You also touched on (in the Hellboy review) why I refuse to judge actors based upon bad movies. Even the best actors struggle to do much with a crap script and/or directing so we shouldn't throw newer actors under the bus based on parts they may be stuck with."
"3996","@SchoolOfMovies Listening to your Hellboy review it seems strange to me that people might criticize you for using Baba Yaga based on it being in this one movie (noting you did draw inspiration from the comics). Is that something you have encountered before?"
"3997","Listen I would love to go back with David hellboy to that kick ass bachelor pad he had but he has to wear THICK socks because if his freaky foot touched me I'd have to leave"
"3998","I'll go against the majority and say I really enjoyed HELLBOY (2019) too. Tonally and violence-wise, it reminded me of HANSEL &amp; GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS. If you like that one, you'll like this."
"3999","A woman’s career would end for even a fourth of this fuckery. How much you want to bet all these jackasses will get more chances after this?"
"4000","#Hellboy Guillermo del Toro did such a good job with Hellboy in the first and second movies that he produced. Hopefully in the next movie, there's a lot more action. I left the theater feeling kind of let down because it was all storyline and not a lot of action or fighting."
"4001","#Hellboy this movie was good, but really Milla Jovovich didn't really have that many parts in the movie that were credible or fight scenes. The trailers made the movie look badass, but the movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Guillermo del Toro puts this to shame"
"4002","#Hellboy just got done watching Hellboy in theaters, it was pretty good but nowhere near as good as the Guillermo del Toro movies. It was only an hour and a half long, and there wasn't much action, it was more acting then it was action and fighting. I felt like it wasn't enough."
"4003","I wanted Del Toros 3rd Hellboy movie too, but people understand he didn't invent Hellboy right? People are bitching that the new movie isn't based on the old movies... That's not how this works. Its even more true to the source material than the old ones"
"4004","@VivziePop The first movie is great, the 2nd movie was also very decent, I'd recommend watching them as they're probably the only time we'll see good cinematic Hellboy sadly."
"4005","@VivziePop The movie was horrible and thst good parts are so shortm..as a Hellboy fan I'm highly disappointed and by the ratings it seems everyone else is too..."
"4006","K. I’m not one to shit on movies. Because I love watching them and I know tons of work goes into them. But the new Hellboy movie was complete ass. The amount of gore was completely unnessasry. The story sucked. And there was 0 character development."
"4007","@Weirwood522 Haven't even heard of it, I wanted to see hellboy today but my friends are losers"
"4008","First off Hellboy’s dad, played by Ian McShane was the worst character in the movie. His dad was a useless side character that had ZERO emotional attachment to Hellboy. Somehow him running the BPRD, and being The dad of HB made him an irrelevant character to the story WTF?"
"4009","@devondandere That’s hot <U+0001F525> pun intended ;) lol #Hellboy #cosplay"
"4010","Hellboy was fun.  I did notice the differences in how Ron played Hellboy and how David plays him.  The pacing in the movie is kind of weird and it was kinda dumb overall, but it was enjoyable.
#hellboy"
"4011","Of course the new HELLBOY film did poorly at the boxoffice. Maybe you can do a Hellboy film without @perlmutations. Maybe you can do a Hellboy film without John Hurt. Maybe you can do a Hellboy film without @SelmaBlair. But without ANY of them? Fuhgeddaboudit."
"4012","We saw the new Hellboy and then came home and now we’re watching GDT’s Hellboy and that is my Hellboy review."
"4013","@johnem95 @KzooMovieDude That's one of the most pointless scenes of the film and can't believe I forgot about this (and I remember Hellboy's head one-liner near the end which is equally bad)."
"4014","Um, I don't remember The Fifth Element being slammed by everybody back when it came out. You're sure you not confusing this with The Million Dollar Hotel or something."
"4015","I forgot I had a crush on a character from the Hellboy movies and reading about them the other day made me absolutely furious with myself for it. Fuckin decade old repressed memory no. Leave"
"4016","Now I see why HellBoy 2 took such a long!!!! time to be released <U+0001F622>"
"4017","I hope this hellboy fiasco shows production companies the issue with reboots and how not everything needs a reboot, focus more on original content."
"4018","Though I'm not familiar with his comic book mythos, I certainly enjoyed Hellboy on the big screen."
"4019","Got invited to watch Hellboy tonight and passed. Also hearing it's really bad."
"4020","Went to go see hellboy w/ Ramon and I had to poop during the movie but I was like nah it can wait NOW I'm at home and I can't poop. V upsetting!!!!"
"4021","@LadyLoganx It was... a movie. I'm a huuuuge Hellboy fan and I found a lot I didnt like, and some things I did like. I REALLY didn't like David Harbour in the role even though I fully expected to. His delivery was rough and he couldn't emote through the makeup (which also was bad)"
"4022","@BobDigi69 I've seen it. It's a complete mess, but not complete shit. Some entertainment can be found in it. As a lifelong Hellboy fan, I was very dissatisfied."
"4023","Sumpah ini hellboy film apaan. Ga jelas bgt. Worst. 3/10.
Stay home friends. Or donate to cancer foundation."
"4024","Y'all remember The Spirit from Frank Miller? That is the closest comparison I can make for #Hellboy."
"4025","@02chucky Which one is HellBoy 2?"
"4026","The new hellboy feels like it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. And believe mean, I truly, honestly, genuinely mean that as anything other than a compliment/any kind of praise."
"4027","The new hellboy feels like it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. And believe me; I truly, honestly, and genuinely mean that as anything other than a compliment/any kind of praise."
"4028","DO NOT go see Hellboy, one of the worst movies I've ever seen"
"4029","@lesvampire I actually haven’t watched either but I had to read a lot on both of them which is what got me thinking, but GDT’s Hellboy vs new Hellboy"
"4030","@NewHackAndSlash The financiers don't care. Hellboy is a known brand. A saleable brand. If this bombs, they will  want to pivot and try again."
"4031","@NewHackAndSlash Actually the reviews Harbour's portrayal have been good. The criticisms have been against the story flow and pacing, the editing, the digital effects, and the hellboy facial prosthetic."
"4032","posting thirst traps to my snapchat so nobody see’s it LMFAOOOOOOOO?????????????? #Hellboy was good tho"
"4033","I hope #Hellboy makes an ungodly amount of money. Seeing films that are critically panned, succeed anyway, is my aesthetic."
"4034","I just saw Hellboy. A father and his two teen daughters were sitting one row in front of me. They left 3/4ths of the way through when spooky zombie witches came out of the ground. I guess that must have been the last straw even though they already saw a bunch of shit already. Lol"
"4035","Hope this new Hellboy movie is at least as good as Hellboy The Golden Army, Its got some big shoes to fill"
"4036","Thoughts about Hellboy:
1. Damn he ugly. Makes Ron Perlman look pretty. Looks a lot more like the comic book though.
2. I anticipated gore and profanity and neither were bad. Less blood, more slimy guts and goo.
3. Solid story
4. Ian McShane <U+2764><U+FE0F>
5. Witch titties disobey physics?"

"4041","@kevinglasow There are also an intimidating number of spinoff books, but it’s not as bad as it seems and they’re pretty much all great as well. The most important one is the ongoing BPRD series. Start with the first Arcudi/Davis Plague of Frogs volume after you get into Hellboy"
"4042","@kevinglasow Hellboy is my favorite comic ever, and I say that as someone who has fervently and incessantly read comics for like 30 years. If you just want to sample what the book has to offer, I would suggest a short story collection like The Chained Coffin or The Right Hand of Doom +"
"4043","Shoot I can't find the podcast where Neil Marshall talks about the Hellboy film with another director. It's one of the few times I actually hear him speak fully about it."
"4044","@IamJordanZoned Yeah I do like that they kinda got out of their MIB phase in this one, showing off more of the fantasy side of Hellboy"
"4045","I'm curious which of the classic #Hellboy films do people prefer? I'd also like to know why? I know some might pick Golden Army mainly because it's the prettiest  and it's the one that's been played the most on television, leaving the first forgotten at times.
#HellboyMovie"
"4046","@DarkLordBaudish I've always though Pans Labyrinth felt more like a Hellboy story. Just cause of the way things looked and how the story transpired. Like you could drop Hellboy in and it'd be one of his short stories. Idk what he'd be doing but it would be cool."
"4047","Went to see Hellboy idk how I feel about <U+0001F928>"
"4048","It just goes to show you that Ron Perlman is in everything. He has 253 credits (halfway to 300) in his filmography alone!"

"4056","Yes I love Alice"
"4057","Oh my god I pity the people who worked on this movie"
"4058","@shoe0nhead @ArmouredSkeptic I mean these re-makes are almost always bad because the motivation behind them to start with was a crippling lack of originality.

"4267","this film approaches a vast assortment of topics ranging from jim crow, to the holocaust, to 9/11 all poignantly and gracefully and it's all made feasible under the strict tutelage of the one and only hellboy, jahseh onfroy."

"4347","@DatKwazyNeko Point of fact, I started putting the first Hellboy story together in Portland Oregon with Mike Mignola in 1997.  You’ll appreciate that at that time, there wasn’t much in the way of material to work from.  When the director came onboard he made a number of changes and additions."

"4349","@Nolanstellar1 @Pandaandwolf The island stuff is the same, except a submarine brings the allied troops there.  Action happens.  Group photograph.

"4356","So, #Hellboy is a hot mess. Relentlessly loud, gory, nonsensical schlock. Harbour is fine if no Perlman but Lane and Kim are horribly miscast. It's just about watchable in a crap kinda way but del Toro's flicks remain definitive big screen Big Red."

"4362","Do me a favor.
Go watch @HellboyMovie 
I can't tell you why, but the ending of the movie will. So please go do it now. I loved it so much. Thank you @artofmmignola for bringing this to life again. @DavidKHarbour was FANTASTIC!!!"
"4363","I now understand why people love the hellboy comics so much."
"4364","@saikocat Big fan of Hellboy, read the comics and stuff. I enjoyed the Ron Perlman ones. Totally not sure if I wanna see this one since so many people hated on it."
"4365","@SeanMElliott It’s what this one gets so wrong. Hellboy is made angry, petulant, and ironically all the weaker for it. You don’t feel the love for his ‘father’. He’s just aggression plus wise cracks. And it’s not Hellboy for it."
"4366","I so wanted the new Hellboy movie to be good. Or even just not disappointing. I didn’t have high hopes ... but even those minimal expectations were dashed. 

Not only was it not Hellboy, it was a god awful piece of storytelling. .5/5 stars (half a star for the cool demons)."
"4367","Theory:  Hellboy was just filmed for the studio to retain the movie rights.... I hate it when studios do this, but that seems the only reason to make a movie bomb like that."

"4371","@johnhornor Is Hellboy still worth seeing? My son and I have it on our radar for Friday potentially."
"4372","@artofmmignola I love the character you created.  I love the movie I just saw on Saturday. And I love how David Harbour made Hellboy his own. He was amazing and I loved the younger more emotionally energetic version David brought to the screen."
"4373","@artofmmignola For what it's worth Mike, the fam &amp; I enjoyed the hell out of #Hellboy David excelled in the role, action packed gory fun throughout. Rotten Tomatoes can go fuck themselves."
"4374","I used to read DC comics as a teenager, but not read any since then. But with the @manticgames @needycatgames Hellboy game KS and sale at Comixology I've picked up vols 1-4. All I can say is @artofmmignola WOW. There is depth and feeling in these comics I never expected. Love it."
"4375","Hellboy was fun, delightful trash,  with an aesthetic straight from the bedroom of a teenage death metal fan. It had decent story bones (my pals disagree) and the mise en scene read like a fucking comic book, I had a great time."
"4376","@ERCboxoffice It's a messy situation all around and I know the ship has sailed for the final Hellboy Trilogy installment. But I feel like if we were given that final film and everyone got that final send off, audiences would be more receptive for a new take"

"4384","@tribalscientist This is how I felt when I watched the first Hellboy."
"4385","@stylo_renn i must’ve seen the original Hellboy 50 times by now. The world is dark and grim, perfectly crafted by Del Toro, with just the right amount of humor and wit. It’s still one of my favorite movies, and I refuse to see the new one cause I dont want it to ruin Hellboy for me <U+0001F62A>"
"4386","That’s a shame. @HellboyMovie is a right load of old tut!"

"4411","Anyone out there actually read #Hellboy? I’m wondering how gory and horror themed the comics are. The movie is a hot mess but I did really enjoy the hard-R demonic horror aspects. I’d be shocked if it didn’t get threatened with a NC17 before making a few trims in editing."
"4412","Just saw HELLBOY. It was ok, but not great. The gore was way over the top gratuitous but the music was good. I’d say wait for it to come out on cable. #Hellboy"
"4413","@TROKNOWS Let me know!  I loved the old Hellboy movies.  Wanna see the reboot.  Also, our first time in 4D will be Avengers.  Wanna know your thoughts on 4D too please."
"4414","@RottenTomatoes Rotten tomatoes doesn’t know shit!!! Go to movie that they say is great snits the worse film ever. Go to one that they hate and it’s awesome. Just watched Hellboy thought that it was great. The gore was awesome.. the CGI was done and it was funny."
"4415","Got $4 tix to #Hellboy and still felt ripped off. Best part was the John Wick 3 preview."
"4416","Played a couple quick case files of my new Hellboy board game today, but forgot to take pictures, and it was really fun! Which is kind of a relief, TBH."
"4417","The plot for Hellboy is batshit crazy. But it insanely fun...tons of monsters and mayhem. Fellow DnD fans will love the giants and f'n Baba Yaga!"
"4418","Hellboy was a dumb fun movie. Had problems but I think that was the studios fault not the directors."
"4419","I'm so glad that I'm smart and hot and have correct taste in everything and I cant wait to listen to Thy Art Is Murder instead of Bathory on the way home from seeing Hellboy (2019)"
"4420","Gonna see hellboy tonight. Stoked to hear him say the F word. More stoked to ignore everyone's opinion on it but mine, as if I were a God and a dictator of all things. Mad with power I grow. Monoliths are reduced to dust. Rivers run blue with Monster Energy Zero Ultra Blue...."
"4421","Also hellboy is a confirmed Converge fan"
"4422","Watching @HellboyMovie thanks to @TMobile #TMobileTuesdays"
"4423","Me: I like you were never really here because it's a commentary on violence in media, especially in film. The story withholds the violence we look for and it's even better for it
Also me: lmao loved the part in Hellboy where that lady ate some dead kids that was cool"
"4424","@rocketfromthe Yes, not the best of designs but the Del Toro Hellboy info is interesting."

"4426","If you are not a fan of extreme gore pls dont watch hellboy"
"4427","HellBoy is Hell of a movie"
"4428","The new one?"
"4429","@jnthnbrlw Query. Del Toro's Hellboys were visually lovely, but crippled by boring, stilted characters (including Hellboy himself, who just wasn't fun). This new one looks as though it's got even *worse* characters, and is visually a very bad video game. How accurate is that assessment?"
"4430","Saw the new Hellboy, I dig it. #Hellboy"
"4431","@MichaelCritzer I put it like this. The more Hellboy you've read, the worst this movie gets. I've read more Hellboy that I can count and everything about this movie was just wrong. The Del Toro versions were pretty accurate, these were...nope."
"4432","@garderina *we walk up to the wall of movie posters. there are quite a few of them, some of the ones include Hellboy, Pet Sematary and Avengers*

"4434","@DavidKHarbour I really enjoyed Hellboy!  You and the other cast members were great!!"
"4435","@peterbriggs Dude, I just wanted to say, thank you for the awsome work on the first Hellboy movie! The Liz stiff didn’t love it that much but the rest was perfection! Specially Rasputin! Thank you so much and the new reboot for more good intentions it has, doesn’t compare to the first one! :)"
"4436","@DatKwazyNeko Every complain in that movie is even worse in the 2019 ver. In matter of ideas, having comic references without buildup or conclusion is not better than a trendy Alice,  obnoxious and  angsty Hellboy, a dick bad mouthed Bruttenholm, Daimo what has no business on this movie—"
"4437","@peterbriggs @Nolanstellar1 But in all seriousness, not making Hellboy 3 was the worst/best idea that could happen, so much change in the dinamic of characters and the twins doesn’t make it better for me, or maybe they do, we’ll never know"
"4438","@peterbriggs @Nolanstellar1 All I know is the reboot killed the possibility of more Hellboy material for at least 10 years, waiting for a TV/animated adaptation following a slow burn story that the original comic is and deserves to be. I hope if that happens, you and the crew of the original be involved :)"
"4439","@smclmn @AOC Doofus, if I spend money to see Shazam this weekend, rather than Hellboy, that's not an act of ""censorship"" against Hellboy."
"4440","Hellboy , his dad , the witch and especially the scene with the Baba Yaga witch have some decent dialogue and good scenes. 
But the film also has some of the worst dialogue ever with other characters and poorly timed humour. Seriously , worst dialogue of the year so far for sure."
"4441","@needyyprincesss Does Hellboy count in that?"
"4442","Hellboy is a bad movie. It’s kind of fun though. The soundtrack is pretty great."
"4443","||: About to see #Hellboy.
So excited!"
"4444","My quick take on #HellboyMovie 
It felt like all of the pieces of a good movie were there, but it seems like a lot of it got lost in the editing room. They could have still started with The Blood Queen, then cut to Hellboy rescuing Alice - then we get backstory on Gruagach"
"4445","going see hellboy tn I guess."
"4446","1. Boss Baby
2. Office Space
3. Horrible Bosses"
"4447","@RJ03365273 I read upon the reviews and I didn't have much hope, but they used a lot of the source material in an entertaining way and the dialogue had a natural feel to it

They also manages to sneak in some witty 4th wall jokes and some nice nods to the director of the other Hellboy movies"
"4448","@RJ03365273 My pleasure (truly!)

I did miss Ron Perlman as Hellboy. David Harbour does the role justice, though. I look forward to see him portray HB in a sequel."
"4449","On the bright side, I got to talk about #UnicornStore which I loved!!"
"4450","Hellboy only made me realize how much I miss seeing Milla Jovovich in movies"
"4451","And that’s the tea <U+2615><U+FE0F>"
"4452","So dad and I r going to see Hellboy tomorrow cause dad is still super tired. And also buses run till eleven mon-friday unlike Sunday so it'll be easier to get to the theater."
"4453","It was just a fun film. Not underwhelming, not the greatest thing ever, just a simple and fun film about one of the best and more unique comicbook characters out there. My long time love of this character aside it overall was just entertaining."
"4454","I'm really surprised but I do think it's just awful timing. It was a good movie."
"4455","#Hellboy is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. You guys did what @DCComics did with Batman."
"4456","is Hellboy the move or nah?"
"4457","@danieldaekim @HellboyMovie I'd love to be there if it was possible."
"4458","@CoyJandreau I saw it in imax yesterday, there were amazing moments and not so amazing moments. To be the shortcomings came in the CG arena mainly because they did go so wild and crazy. Some scenes hit, others missed. But at the end of the day it was batshit crazy and as Hellboy as it gets."
"4459","@GeekVibesNation @MLSexton_WWAN @MicahHarshaw @Zepp1978 @TC_Stark @DoubleOh_Kevin @JamesGavsie @HarrySpencer01 @AJ_GeekVibes Finally got a chance to see it aaaaaaaaaanndd I have to agree!! A very fun, yet flawed popcorn flick. I'm sad we may not get more out of them because I loved the cast and David Harbor as #Hellboy"
"4460","@PatrickZircher Silver surfer and spider - for their fluidity 
Hellboy - best representation of their opposite"
"4461","@DavidKHarbour was a great #Hellboy in my opinion, worthy of @perlmutations excellent rendition as well."
"4462","Just saw #Hellboy and I enjoyed it. Hellboy fans will like it mostly I think, but I understand why non fans would give a negative review. It’s very poorly executed."
"4463","@Sarah_Samedi You ARE the new Hellboy.
(I mean that as a compliment)"
"4464","@onlymoviepod I hear both are bad but that hellboy is probably worse. So I vote hellboy"
"4465","I have such massive sympathy for @artofmmignola right now. The number of people I see posting about how the new Hellboy is wrong because he doesn't like cats and candy... and then poor Mike has to reply, ""Oh. I see you've never read the comic.... "" #ReadHellboy"
"4466","#HellboyMovie is like four episodes of a Hellboy TV show. Some episodes are better than others but I'd be down to watch several seasons with @DavidKHarbour Hellboy anchoring a full BPRD cast."
"4467","Almost everything about HELLBOY is bad, but also Milla Jovovich is good."
"4468","@frenchristophe @Polygon I know it was bad. But we live in a golden age of comic book movies. Studios finally see the value of these characters, but it won’t last forever, and pretty soon the public will move on to something else. I want Hellboy to reach his full on screen potential before that happens."
"4469","@Ron73144521 @frenchristophe @Polygon Okay true, they were amazing. Especially Hellboy 2. Still, I feel like it can be done better. We should have gotten Hellboy 3 instead of a reboot"
"4470","Wow. The critics nailed this one. Hellboy was awful. Loud, bloody,
disjointed and awful dialogue - and I had very low expectations.l"
"4471","Quick review of Hellboy? I refer to this movie as ""90%"". As in, ""what about this aspect of the movie?"" It's about 90% done. Script? 90%. Acting? 90%. Effects? 90%."
"4472","I will now be referring to David Harbour's Hellboy as 'Big Sexy'.

First one who replies with a picture of Kevin nash gets cut in half with a chainsaw"
"4473","So for our marketing class, we had to join the merch designing competition for @TGVCinemas for hellboy and the rules were the group with the most likes, tgv will produce the merch. So we were like spamming people to like the pic and end up we get nothing but a certificate only."
"4474","Yeesh, not hearing good things about this new Hellboy.
Obviously I wish Del Toro got to make his Hellboy 3, but I was also willing to give the new one a fair shake. The trailers at least made it look fun.
At this point I think I'll wait until it's streaming somewhere..."
"4475","Lmao yeah ain’t nobody come to see Hellboy"
"4476","@HiTopFilms Honestly not as awful as critics have been saying, Hellboy is gonna be 2019’s Venom"
"4477","I don't know want the problem is because I just had a hell rasing good time watching #Hellboy"
"4478","The new Hellboy is really good. That is all for now."
"4479","@Ben_3420 Not a fan of the 4DX...but the kiddo loved it. The chairs are what you might call not comfy at all. And I prefer the @perlmutations version of Hellboy; this version was a bit too scattered about for my liking. I’m a fan of continuity with the story line...&amp; this one failed"
"4480","Ok, remaking “Hellboy” was unnecessary, but I have seen worse movies. We were entertained. I didn’t realize Milla Jojovich was in it so there’s that:)"
"4481","@timmal510 While that would be an extremely effective squad, some of them are a bit too heroic to be on a team of this sort, yes? Hellboy, Indiana Jones, River Tam, and Han Solo all fit the bill but the more moral characters would likely stick out in a black ops group."
"4482","The pacing and editing of the new Hellboy movie reminded me of the 90s Spider-Man cartoon show."
"4483","Absolutely loved the newest Hellboy live action movie!!! #HellboyMovie"
"4484","So, #Hellboy was an amazing movie! @DavidKHarbour and @MillaJovovich and the rest of the cast did a great job!! :)"
"4485","Yeah, the Hellboy movie was kind of disappointing. I’m a touch bummed about it."
"4486","@XMenMovies Has a Hellboy feel to it."
"4487","Went and saw Hellboy with Haley instead of prom because FUCK that high school shit"
"4488","@MillaJovovich I hope there will be a Hellboy sequel cause u really enjoyed the remake and you were a badass even though you were the villain you were still a badass #davidharbour you were also a badass."
"4489","It’s a testament to how good the Game of Thrones season 8 premiere was last night that I completely forgot I watched the Hellboy reboot too"
"4490","SPOILERS
 
The good things from the Hellboy reboot: Some of the monsters look cool, David Harbour’s version has a decent enough arc, and the ending is kinda cool minus a few rough spots

The bad: THOSE FUCKING INTESTINAL GHOST THINGS WTF and the writing"
"4491","hellboy was simply AMAZING the soundtrack the effects i’m love"
"4492","about to c hellboy hehe"
"4493","I didn’t know Hellboy was in Theater already <U+0001F644>"
"4494","Fuck the new Hellboy movie. The new one is just bullshit"
"4495","Am I one the few people in the world who actually like hellboy (2019) it was a decent movie imo"
"4496","@HolyNosebleed Him definitely, but coming to odds with Hellboy's approach."
"4497","FYI the @HellboyMovie trailer shows you pretty much the entire movie and all it's big moments"
"4498","Watching a movie to own drumpft"
"4499","Hellboy is the best movie I've seen since Bambi."
"4500","Just checking because i really dont know... hows the new Hellboy doing?"
"4501","@Unreallucasart @perlmutations Just checking because i really dont know.. hows the new Hellboy doing?"
"4502","Bad CGI and excessive gore aside...  I liked it....  #Hellboy"
"4503","Ok let's give that new Hellboy movie a go. I am gonna try to abandon all my preformed opinions but ehhh probs won't be able to"
"4504","I’m not here to trot out contrarian takes on Del Toro’s movies, and I don’t know the comics for shit. All I know is that Marshall’s movie was like watching a drunk-off-his-ass Clive Barker write HELLBOY fan fiction and I am endlessly here for it."
"4505","I spent Star Wars: Celebration week and now Game of Thrones night talking about why the new HELLBOY might be, and then is, Actually Good, so I’m sure the SEO Manager job offers from major entertainment sites will appear any minute now."
"4506","I spent Star Wars: Celebration week and now Game of Thrones night talking about why the new HELLBOY might be, and then is, Actually Good, so I’m sure the SEO Manager job offers from major entertainment sites will appear any minute minute."

"4508","@AisleSeat We will disagree on this but Hellboy."
"4509","@mrsundaymovies I feel like the podcast should be about Disney+ this week and you can parlay that into Star Wars. Disney+ and Star Wars maybe? (I predict it’s actually “Hellboy is...”)"
"4510","@mcbourbonnais1 I would vote Captain Marvel, I loved the older Hellboy movies, but not hearing good things about the reboot.  Shazam looks good too though."
"4511","@LabSplice I don’t think we’ll ever get a truly faithful adaptation that’s not animated, they’re just not really matches. I think when Del Toro’s succeed it’s mostly because of Perlman. I liked HB2 a lot but it didn’t really strike me as a Hellboy movie."
"4512","Watched Hellboy, I dug it, watched Star Wars trailer and cried. Eat a bag of dicks Disney, you killed the greatest franchise of my life. Also have my Endgame tix and nearly pee'd a little buying them"
"4513","SHAZAM was great. Do I dare leave this theater and immediately go see Hellboy."
"4514","@mcbourbonnais1 Hellboy is not supposed to be very good, so watch either Captain Marvel or Shazam"
"4515","It had great humor, interesting monster designs, lots of bloody violence but also goofiness. A great blend of mythology and history. David Harbour is awesome as Hellboy. I legitimately feel like I must live in an alternate reality to all these critics."
"4516","Not sure if other people saw the same movie as me or not but Hellboy was a blast! Really enjoyed it. I hope they make more things in this world because it is interesting. #Hellboy"
"4517","I’m just happy we can finally end the edgelord narrative that comic adaptations being hyper-violent and rated-R don’t equal immediate success"
"4518","Recently watched: “Hellboy” (2019)—Nowhere in the class of Guillermo Del Toro’s two movies this R rated reboot from Neil Marshall (“The Descent”) is ok. Some good humor and performances but it will not make you forget @perlmutations version of Red. Too long &amp; all over the place."
"4519","This was bothering me, I cited the wrong Hellboy books. Chained Coffin, Wild Hunt, Darkness Calls, and Storm and the Fury. Phew, ok, back to sleep."
"4520","So. The new Hellboy. Short version: it's a complete mess. It simultaneously understands yet utterly fails to understand Hellboy and the mythos, creating one of the most confusing adaptations I've ever seen."
"4521","However, it treats these stories. with deep, inseparable roots to every prior Hellboy adventure into an origin story. So the starting point for Hellboy in this movie is the beginning of his endgame in the comics."
"4522","This new movie has the benefit of 15 additional, or 25, years of Hellboy stories to pull from versus GDT's 10. It thrusts Hellboy in the middle of a storyline which combines years of what seemed to be scattered plot into a concrete, centralized narrative."
"4523","The parts it gets right are absolute perfection, but those fleeting moments are overshadowed and instantly forgotten by what it gets wrong. It isn't a movie for Hellboy fans, and it isn't a movie non-Hellboy fans will understand without a LOT of context; it's a movie for no one."
"4524","Every ""how do we pander"" moment, which is most of the movie, obliterates all traces of Hellboy's originality and individuality, resulting in a milquetoast hero movie that coincidentally stars Hellboy and has key plot elements from his mythos."
"4525","In other words, Hellboy, who is technically 75 years old, has no idea who he is or what significance he plays in the occult world, while acting like a disillusioned teenager lacking any sort of real world experience as the movie starts."
"4526","@mcbourbonnais1 Captain Marvel first. Then Hellboy later. Both are pretty good"
"4527","@mcbourbonnais1 I've seen all of them.

Shazam is funny and original.

Marvel is boring and on the bottom of the MCU list.

Hellboy is a mess."
"4528","watching hellboy put me in a super DOOM mood but ive been borderline on a migraine since this afternoon and that's not good DOOM vibes. ; ___;"
"4529","@mcbourbonnais1 Shazam, Shazam again, Captain Marvel, anything else that’s playing besides Hellboy, and well that’s it really."
"4530","Went and saw #Hellboy, enjoyed the hell out of it. If you're a fan of the comics, make sure you stay for all of the credits!"
"4531","The new Hellboy movie was okay I’m probably biased because I love the original ones so much"
"4532","On one hand, I am deeply sadden at Hellboy flopping &amp; being this panned

On the other hand, Hellboy flopping may mean that the 16 idiot producers for the film won’t be able to ever touch the Hellboy franchise again"
"4533","Oh no, the #Hellboy face emoji is good :("
"4534","Oh no, the #Hellboy face emoji is gone :("
"4535","Which company has a jar of pee in their film?

Both DCEU &amp; MCU make movies for adults who can’t wipe their ass right

Unlike #Hellboy 2019 which was made for mature adults"
"4536","@niklander2 The good news is every Hellboy film has been made by a different company

Hellboy 1 by Sony
Hellboy 2 by Universal or Paramount (I get them so confused)
Hellboy 2019 by Lionsgate

So if we ever get another Hellboy film, it won’t be by that company"
"4537","On one hand, I am deeply sadden at Hellboy flopping &amp; being this panned

On the other hand, Hellboy flopping may mean that the 14 idiot producers for the film who bullied the director &amp; cast won’t be able to ever touch the Hellboy franchise again"

Sometimes."
"4551","It’ll be tough to beat the “spirit coming out of someone’s mouth” effect from #Hellboy as the worst effect of this year I think."
"4552","There’s good stuff in the movie:

David Harbour makes a good Hellboy, the monsters are cool, there’s tons of gore and the humour works well.

Then... there are some truly awful special effects at times, major plot holes and it lacks the original two films’ great storytelling."
"4553","Honestly, this script needed like one or two more drafts. 

Lots you could have excised, lots you could have tightened, lots you could have fixed so it makes sense, lots you could have spent more time on.

Shame, there was definitely a good Hellboy movie in there somewhere."
"4554","The We'll Be Back post-credits sequence in the new Hellboy reboot is about as convincing as the one in the live action Masters of the Universe film."
"4555","I... really, really enjoyed the new Hellboy. I feel like the people saying it doesn't capture the tone of Mignola's work maybe need to re-read said work? It's not perfect by any means, but in a lot of ways I like it more than Del Toro's vision - which I also enjoyed a lot."
"4556","I didn't even realise the new Hellboy movie was out already and apparently it's shite. Might be why there doesn't feel like there's been any press for."
"4557","@ZackDavisson @artofmmignola I still think about the time this basically happened live at a panel at SDCC and people just could NOT handle Mike saying “Hellboy had a dog...” and the cats are pure GDT invention.

"4579","@yxxng_sean @HellboyMovie @IMAX Honestly, was it really the worst movie you have ever seen? Really? I loved the movie-This is a pure example why you can never listen to critics, meters &amp; reviews-Because reviews are subjective, with no concrete basis for an opinion, therefore no value.Everyone judge for yourself"
"4580","@danieldaekim @DavidKHarbour @MillaJovovich Sorry that Hellboy has been treated so hard by some people. I think there is something wrong with the tomato meter; they should check it out because the rating Hellboy received was so wrong &amp; those critics, I don’t know what movie they saw because it’s clearly not the movie I did"
"4581","Guillermo del Toro's HELLBOY was a high point in comic book movie history, and even now, it's a reminder that comic book films can be delightfully strange and magical. 

Neil Marshall's reboot is just two hours of cinematic torment."

"4593","@Pandaandwolf Hellboy was plenty angsty/ cranky in vol 9, since a ton of different entities were badgering him to take up excalibur when he wanted nothing to do with it, so I still dont agree with you there.
After checking up on a hunch, yeah...they combined Alice and Johann Kraus...yikes &gt;&gt;;"
"4594","@Pandaandwolf I still feel the 2004 Hellboy changed the underlying plot too much. I really didnt like HB turning into some Goverment secret they had to sneak into places, that was a BIIIG change I didnt enjoy :&lt;
I also didnt like that Abe felt so... fragile and kinda useless in general.. :&lt;"

"4612","#hellboy was a good ass movie even though there was a lot of problem with the plot and doesn't live up to original,  it still has potential.  Can't wait for the sequel"
"4613","Hellboy will find itself in the same situation Punisher: War Zone had 11 years ago. Terrible reviews and it won’t make any money, but it’ll find a cult audience in a couple years."
"4614","I get why people didn’t like it.

Personally I had fun with it."

"4624","hellboy is a fucking awesome movie.

i LIKE IT"
"4625","@JereStuff Are you talking the new movie? I haven’t seen it yet.
To me, the gore in the Hellboy comics was kind of the equivalent of old horror films where you know the blood is chocolate syrup. If that makes sense. It’s not that they weren’t dark, or dark humor..."
"4626","@VivziePop The Del Toro Hellboy films was the first time I was exposed to hellboy and I loved them. When I heard it was being rebooted I was upset at first but I looked forward to it after trailer 2. Just finished it, my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."
"4627","Just saw @HellboyMovie  with @Blazing_blu and @333stephy333 
Great fucking movie"
"4628","I still want an adult Hellboy animated series with Mike Mignola art style in a similar to The Amazing Screw-On Head on HBO or @netflix . That will probably never happen because of the newest #HellboyMovie being a total critical flop. The Hellboy brand name is probably ruined now."
"4629","TLDR screw the reviews and just go see Hellboy if you like fun"
"4630","This is coming from a Perlman Hellboy stan who did not want this film to exist at all and now I want a sequel even if it kills me"

"4634","@HellboyMovie @Lionsgate Super film, guys. Thanks for that!)"
"4635","I didn't mind the new #Hellboy, but it was just about ""This guy is an ugly monster, but pretty on the inside."" Whereas @realgbt and @perlmutations told us ""we're all beautiful *because* we're all monsters"" and that resonates across boundaries."
"4636","Hellboy was a change from the cute hijinx of it's two predecessors. A gorefest from start to end all to a rock ballad. Surprisingly Hellboy. Not intended for the younger audience I'm sure, as some parents found out as they left the theatre kids in tow."
"4637","Slow at work and everyone thinks it’s because of Game of Thrones and Coachella but I’m pretty sure it’s the Hellboy reboot."
"4638","I can't decide what's more unintentionally funny: Hellboy, or Luc Besson doubling down on the whole rip-off thing."
"4639","What a cool pic and post :)"
"4640","@HellboyMovie I really liked the movie. Loved it even. A metal album unfolding upon my very eyes."
"4641","@ERodBuster1 I have seen some videos reviewing Hellboy 2019 where the host would say ""I haven't read the comics"" and it did annoy me a bit but that impression you did was not necessary.  There are people who have only seen the movies but that doesn't make them less of a Hellboy fan."
"4642","Neil Marshall’s Hellboy is a FINE example of being a gritty R rated reboot doesn’t always mean quality."

"4646","Trying to think of whether I would have enjoyed Hellboy if the others didn't exist and I think I'd enjoy it more than I did but it still had parts that were weirdly lacking in visual flair, which you can never say about Guillermo Del Toro flicks."
"4647","Hellboy is pretty bad. The gore is great though. Wish the Del Toro ones were this violent."
"4648","Ignore the critics. @HellboyMovie is AMAZING! @DavidKHarbour was perfect and I must see it again! This is the Hellboy we should have gotten from the start! Sorry, Del Toro fans, this version is superior! #Hellboy #davidharbour #Hellboy2019 #ignorethecritics #besthellboymovie"

"4651","@EnSabahNur1976 @QueuedUpPodcast @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour I am going to hold my thoughts because I seen nothing but bad reviews from friends, and critics alike. But I loved the first Hellboy and love Del Toro works. So was Hellboy 1 not your fav?"
"4652","everyone has been putting that horrible bruhmoments tweet on my timeline and i just wanted to say that the only thing good that came out of 2016 was all of the amazing cloud rap albums that dropped, like warlord, eversince and hellboy"

"4655","Taking the piece of paper, Hellboy reads it over for a second. His lips form a small smile, and he nods at her in response.

     “Thanks,” he tells her sincerely. “I won’t hesitate to call at all.”"
"4656","Hellboy might be a little bit tipsy.

      He got a little too excited while watching Game of Thrones."
"4657","@CursedDna “I dunno,” Hellboy answered, crossing his arms over his chest.
     “Maybe for you to not be such an asshole?”"
"4658","I can watch hellboy over and over again"
"4659","The fact that I found out about there even being a new Hellboy, like a few days after it was out already is so fucking weird. Did not come out from underneath my rock enough or was the marketing team asleep?"
"4660","@TrashCanDanpt3 I saw it tonight as a big Marshall and Hellboy fan. Definitely a lot of fun. There are clunky elements and some of the CGI looks like the result of the smaller $50 m budget. Liking it will be a matter of taste, but the people out there saying it’s the worst of the year are nuts."
"4661","Hellboy had a horrible story to it but at least it was visually fun to watch."
"4662","Hellboy is a complete bs. Felt like a B-movie with unnecessary gore, cheesy monsters and plot written for kindergarten  <U+0001F926><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F>"
"4663","@MichaelCWoody This is good to know and I actually figured as much. But, regardless I just couldn't wrap my head around a Hellboy movie without, Ron Perman anyway."
"4664","@mcbourbonnais1 Shazam is the most fun. Captain Marvel has the best action. Hellboy should be skipped."
"4665","I just watched @ShazamMovie and Hellboy 2019. I enjoyed both for what they were. Shazam was a fun superhero film with horror elements and themes of family and power while Hellboy 2019 was a dark fantasy/horror imagery fest with blood and gore."
"4666","Just looking at the thumbnails on Youtube for the Hellboy movie is enough to let me know what people the reviewer thinks."
"4667","@Arminies I hope we just get a third Hellboy at this point."
"4668","Overall the new #Hellboy isn’t great by any means but it sure as shit isn’t as terrible as some would have you believe. I for one hope they manage to do a sequel cuz I’m down for more David Harbour’s Hellboy. But really I just want a Lobster Johnson movie. <U+0001F91E><U+0001F3FB>"
"4669","Some thoughts on the new #Hellboy 
1. Lobster Johnson was THE best part for those who know of him. I really hope we get a spin-off film.
2. This movie is much better than the 15% RT score.
3. Ron Perlman can never be replaced but David Harbour was great."
"4670","Watching @HellboyMovie <U+0001F479> at @AMCTheatres"
"4671","@RiseFallNick I saw it and thought it was great. Shame. Theatre was nearly empty when I saw it Friday night. Hellboy which I saw Thursday night also bombed. Go figure!"
"4672","@HellboyMovie a mess of a big budget gory film. Poor director Neil Marshall did not get his vision. Its not funny, the effects are terrible, @DavidKHarbour is fine as hellboy, but its just a big mess. 3.1/10"
"4673","The devil is real and he made this fucking tweet"
"4674","Hellboy (2019) is so much of fun! Thoroughly entertaining. Funny, fast paced and a good time throughout. Might watch it again I was so entertained.#HELLBOY"
"4675","Today I saw Hellboy and Game of Thrones... and one of those things was absolutely incredible."
"4676","@MrPinkPalooka and suddenly pink is trying to imitate hellboy"

"4679","@HellboyMovie  @DoctorFreedom1 @DarkHorseComics #Hellboy2019  It's good movie with decent characters but lacks a lot of detail . The action is spot on and the creatures are wonderful, but the movie needs to slow down, for it feels way too rushed. Rating: 6.5/10"
"4680","@Felixexel Any particular story I should check out? All I know about Hellboy is from the movies &amp; Injustice lol"
"4681","Just giving whomever want to come Tomorrow at 4 I’m going to see HELLBOY IN LARGO MALL!! Just giving you a heads up!!"
"4682","@Joi_the_Artist I totally agree with you, Ron Perlman was Hellboy and played him perfectly! But I think David Harbour played the more Dark side of him really well! I loved Alice!! Can't wait to see Abe on screen!! Did you cry when Broom died?"
"4683","@Joi_the_Artist I agree(though I cried cause Hellboy wasn't ready to say goodbye) I found his Broom to be to cold. I really loved John Hurt as Professor Broom(yes I cried when he died in the moive<U+0001F62D>) I love that scene to!! Its so amazing to see and so iconic!!"
"4684","@Joi_the_Artist I LOVED her! She was amazing and really did an amazing job. What about David Harbour as Hellboy?"

"4686","Weekend box office: Shazam stays on top while Hellboy flops

Warner Bros. Pictures superhero film Shazam! managed to stay on top of the box office its second week in theaters, beating new releases Little and Hellboy – the latter of which is looking like a major flop.

The po…"
"4687","@_AndrewScott I really enjoyed it! Hellboy is my # 2 character behind Spider-Man, there is so much taken directly from the comic. The only downside in my opinion was the music, it seemed out of place in most scenes."
"4688","@Defectivenaruto @QueuedUpPodcast @HellboyMovie @DavidKHarbour I enjoyed the original Del Toro Hellboy, but something always felt off to me. And I felt The Golden Army was terrible. This one is superior to me in every way. @DavidKHarbour is excellent in the role, the film is darker in tone and gorier and more fitting to the Mignola comics."
"4689","I just seen #Hellboy... I wasn’t a fan of the CGI <U+0001F602>. Looked bad. Low budget. But overall, it was alright. I’ll rate it 6 out of 10."
"4690","I had to read ""Go See Hellboy over Captain Marvel"" with my own eyes and I am in pain."
"4691","Hellboy was so mediocre and I’m really sad"
"4692","@Star_Plat It was just boring and the cool shit they show in the trailer is basically just in the trailer. Also the cgi was god awful, somehow it was worse than the second hellboy movie which came out 10 years ago."
"4693","#HellboyMovie was a blast! I'll admit, I did miss #RonPerlman , but David certainly put in the work to make the role his own and it shows. The pace &amp; focus of this entry is fairly different from Del toro's 2 films, but is quite in line with the comics. Solid 4/5 <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>!"
"4694","@kurtruslfanclub @RebelliousEwok @my2k Yup, I had no idea it was out.  I know Shazam is out, and Hellboy, I cannot seem to avoid ads for them."
"4695","@davidscottjaffe have you had the chance to see the new Hellboy yet? Curious to hear your opinion"
"4696","I’ve seen some truly terrible films in my 25 years on the earth, but the new Hellboy may just be about the worst. Wow."
"4697","Hellboy had a lot of cool scenes in it.  <U+0001F919>"
"4698","Getting COBBLER level deja vu with all the hate being lobbed in this movie's direction."
"4699","#Hellboy Poor reboot but wasn’t that bad either if you didn’t compare to GDT version. Neil Marshall brought sensible adaption to Mike Mignola’s creation with blood-soaked actions and atrocious plots from start to finish. This monster mash should be censorship-free to enjoy! 2.5/5"
"4700","how on earth did they make something as rad as fucking hellboy incredibly uninteresting"
"4701","Don't see the new Hellboy movie instead watch the Guillermo del Toro films and read the damn comics. (which i am yet to do too btw)"
"4702","Hellboy didnt need a reboot, its actually a shame because Hellboy is a great character and the new movie butchered him."

"4718","If you want to know how bad my anxiety has been lately, I’m walking an hour to the movie theater at 9:00 pm to see the new HELLBOY that everyone says is absolutely godawful just because I need to get out of the fucking house/my head so bad."

"4723","@neontaster It follows the comics pretty closely in terms of how Hellboy deals with monsters, the settings (old mansions, churches, etc.), and Hellboy as a character was spot on. The pacing was just awful, the soundtrack was cringey, and was too focused on giving comic fans iconic scenes."

@DavidKHarbour, I loved Perlman but you really earned those horns. Well done."

I saw Hellboy.
Maybe it’s because I love urban religious fantasy (hellloooo), but I thought it was pretty good.
It had some major directorial issues (pacing and energy were monotonously overwhelming), and the script was more box checking than storytelling.
But it wasn’t BAD."

Also the “legendary AF” tagline"
"4787","@jrgdrawing Without outright spoiling the film, the movies climax revolves around creating the biggest anti-thesis to Hellboy’s characterization of “Man who rejects his destiny and the big pinnings of fate”, for the sake of some violence and gore and big explosive visuals."

"4796","As a fan of both the #Hellboy Comics and the 2 prior movies, I have to say this #Hellboymovie wasn’t that bad. Sure it moved a little fast for my liking, and a bigger budget could have been used for the special FX, but the movie is pretty good."

"4803","Man, the #Hellboy reboot is a truly and obnoxiously crude, loud, and uninspired piece of hot garbage.  It’s all the more shameful because David Harbour is perfectly cast as the titular demonic hero and is ultimately wasted here."
"4804","No more Hellboy movies fellas"
"4805","@CryptidHxnt -and started in on a run down the hallway and round another corner, then another and finally into a custodial closet in which Hellboy knew of the Bogart that lived in it. He whipped open the door and got in before pulling Robert in with him, then shut the door plunging them -"
"4806","@my2k I was gonna watch hellboy until i saw missing link was out and i dropped hellboy and watched missing link instead and enjoyed myself"
"4807","#Hellboy was so much better than I anticipated. The marketing has done it NO justice. Honestly, while it had some flaws? I like it better than either of the two previous movies. So many elements were finally brought to life."
"4808","Yooo there's a new hellboy movie in cinema???! I need to watch that"
"4809","So I saw the new heckman movie the other night and while I thought I wouldn’t take to the new actor he grew on me fast as fuck and they frankly made hellboy Way Too Hot. 30% uglier and 70% sexier by virtue of literally everything on that demon himbo"
"4810","@Sully_Writes SERIOUSLY. I got into Russian folklore because of Hellboy and Koschei is one of the best characters."
"4811","I keep coming back to just how deeply I loved seeing the Celtic and Russian folklore influences come out in the new #Hellboy movie. I'll always love Del Toro's version, but those influences are such a huge part of what I love about @artofmmignola's work."
"4812","Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is read Hellboy, the stories are great and Mike Mignola's art kicks pantheons worth of ass. His torsos are also very #relatable"
"4813","@ThunderGruntBob Does HELLBOY finally turn into a Hellman in this one? Oh no I just thought of mayonnaise"
"4814","This Hellboy reboot is Karma swinging back around on us for daring to have 4 good movies with the character before this."
"4815","For what it's worth I had to rant about this to someone and @ravennoises is both my best friend and has done this to me before so."
"4816","Oh snap. Didn't realize that the new Hellboy didn't have Ron Perlman in it. Maybe I'll go see it now."
"4817","Bought Injustice 2 Complete edition and I fucking forgot they put in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hellboy in this god damn game. Neather Reapm EXPLAIN"
"4818","@__caprica Thought it was pretty bad as well.

Pros: 
Baba Yaga
Monster gore
Harbour actually held the role quite well

Cons:
Terrible practical effects, costumes and makeup. (Hellboy's ""rock"" hand went squishy as he tries to prop himself up)
Head-spinning editing
Lobster Johnson

4/10"
"4819","It still has that wonderful Hellboy style and if you search for it there is a good movie somewhere in this huge mess."
"4820","Oh yeah forgot to tweet about Hellboy.

Its nowhere near as bad as people told me but its still not very good and literally the first 40 mins of the film is a side mission.

The saddest part is the 40 min side mission is 1000x better than the rest of the film."
"4821","I’m not joking. Had lunch. Then we’re like ok let’s go to the movies, we were gonna catch the 2:45 showing of HellBoy and then we’re like ummm Game of Thrones comes sooner tho... so we sat in the car, found a shady area, and watched Game of Thrones in the car on the iPad lol"

And if he is a boy, then what would be considered a man in his world?"

"4833","So: Hellboy! I feel like people who really like monsters and Mignola Verse stuff will enjoy this. It has pacing and sound direction that could be improved, but I honestly liked it!

More than I was worried I would, after hearing about reviews."
"4834","@IronNinja2000 @BeholdTheSack I feel bad for the Hellboy fans and moviemakers"
"4835","@ProjectENDO okay i saw hellboy and no dont go see it"
"4836","@ProjectENDO Okay so... it was really disappointing. it felt weirdly paced because its essentially 6 different hellboy stories stitched into one. Apparently there were loads of rewrites and reshoots becauseof the producers, and there are barely any glimpses of the fun movie it could have been"
"4837","Hellboy was fun. I liked the fast pace and all the action. I liked the characters. Most of the time, it looked amazing (some CGI looked weird). A very bloody, popcorn, comic book movie.

I found it enjoyable. Sorta reminded me of Punisher: War Zone, in the best way possible."
"4838","hellboy baby i stand out"
"4839","Just got back from the new Hellboy. Really enjoyed it, and getting some inspiration for future chapters of Blood and Lace."
"4840","I feel like the new Hellboy actor being like “oh yeah hellboy can’t fuck humans” is a serious case of shitting where one eats, and I have the Rotten Tomato score to prove it."
"4841","Just saw Hellboy , was decent , its crazy how Alot Of movies have ties to King Arthur."
"4842","I mean we learn stuff about hell boys lineage, but not much about hellboy, at one point hell boy flat out asked his father a question about why he didn't kill him, and his dad just says ""I don't regret my decision"" which is not an answer and tells us nothing (part 2)"

"4848","@HiTopFilms But people should know how not to make movies. Hellboy (2019) is a good example of how this should not be done."
"4849","@brabakr Yes, I've read the comics and finished Hellboy in Hell. Your delivery of messages confuse me because there was no context."
"4850","@brabakr I just meant for mine to say that I've been posting too much Hellboy related content on my followers' feeds."
"4851","The new Hellboy’s opening weekend BARELY made over half of what the first GDT Hellboy movie made, which itself was a bit of a flop. This new Hellboy’s tanking hard and honestly good riddance for them doing GDT as dirty as they did."

"4855","i really wanted to like hellboy."
"4856","Game of thrones was cool and all, but have you guys watched the new #hellboy movie? It's a thing of beauty. Action, gore, and a whole lot of swearing. It's jam packed with monsters and witches. Well done @DavidKHarbour this was a fun movie!!"
"4857","Wow, Hellboy is actually that deplorable."
"4858","Would LOVE to see @marsaimartin OPPOSITE @Winston_Duke, who’s one of the GREATEST actors working now doing “subtly”, in some @JordanPeele movies.

"4860","I will literally be the most pissed off I've ever been in my entire life if THIS is the Hellboy movie that makes a billion dollars. Even as a joke, I'd be fucking livid. GDT worked so fucking hard and did not deserve to be tossed aside like he was...Harbour is pretty dope though."

"4867","I love David harbor but I give Hellboy a solid steaming pile of shit."

"4871","@BonneTorres Wow good for you you watch hellboy 3 in cinemas well I know the plot story of pt1 &amp; Pt2 but for pt3 is a new story concept that hellboy is had a new story new characters new 
Bad guys of course that's why 
New plot story of hellboy 3
But I wait for 4Th sequel 
Of hellboy"
"4872","Like a second rendition of this #hellboy would be dope af but because y’all fall into this blockbuster mentality it won’t happen critics suck <U+0001F927><U+0001F927>"
"4873","Bitch Guillermo De Toro did Blade 2 and I swear Hellboy is in the same universe."
"4874","@boxofficemojo Hopefully i enjoy Hellboy like the 64% of the audience in RT did. Give me some good jokes, awesome action scenes and you're good. I still gotta see Shazam as well, planning to go after work this morning."
"4875","I don't care if anyone likes what I like. I don't need anyone's approval, permission or objection to me watching a movie, a tv show/tv series, being a fan of something, being a fan of an actor, I obviously don't gaf about that. In spite of the nasty reviews I went to see Hellboy"
"4876","2) and I liked alright. It's nowhere near the horrific mess the reviews say it is, however!; you do need to be a fan of the comicbook to enjoy it more I think. I've never been a Hellboy comics reader. But it's not the worst film ever. Also a reminder to my mutuals: people don't"
"4877","the new Hellboy is the definition of “so bad it’s good”"
"4878","Hellboy was a disappointing pile of shit."
"4879","Suicide Squad and now the new Hellboy film are perfect examples of how adding some cool songs won’t turn a shitty film into a good one"
"4880","One good thing about the movie is that they are making me want to go back and finish the Hellboy comics. I read through a lot of it a few years ago and really liked them, but didn't quite get through all of them since there are a lot, but I should in order to do them justice."
"4881","I just saw the new #hellboy movie and, god, was it aweful. Most of the acting was bad, the pacing was completely off, and despite it being an end of the world scenario I didn't feel any stakes. I liked the Baba Yaga scene, the epilogue scene, and Ian Mcshane, but that's it."
"4882","Hellboy gotta be the most confusing movie i ever seen in my life."
"4883","@artofmmignola This is the MOST accurate headline of the year. Hellboy is my favorite, always has been always will be. Thanks for making such a nice little devil child for us all to love."

"4885","HELLBOY (2019) is weird and fun as fuck. Love the cold open in Tijuana, THC as Lobster Johnson, and the father/son dynamic in lieu of a love interest. Not as good as Gizmo's first film, but tops the shitty sequel. My only real grievance is Hellboy doesn't smoke. Why the fuck not?"
"4886","(( derse = old hellboy

prospit = new hellboy ))"
"4887","Watching original hellboy to become reacquainted with the character."
"4888","The new Hellboy is considerably cooler than peeps are saying. 

The catch is its cool in the way a one-off anime movie adaptation of a long-running and still going manga series is cool. 

It's cool the way something like the X/1999 movie was cool.

Make of that what you will."

"4892","About two see Hellboy. Hope I get... anything out of it."
"4893","Thought it was pretty cool they used a @MotleyCrue song in the @HellboyMovie pretty cool considering #thedirtmovie just came out. Just another reminder of @machinegunkelly and all his accomplishments <U+2764><U+FE0F>"

@ me. Ha.

"4895","Anyone see the new Hellboy? I'm nervous. I want it to be good."
"4896","watched hellboy (2004) i think my favourite thing about it was how gentle it was in moments i unconsciously expected to be Movie Tuff"
"4897","Hellboy ended with a Mötley Crüe song and tbh probably the best part of the movie lmao sorry not sorry"
"4898","Hellboy was an absolute pile of garbage, but I loved every second of it."
"4899","However, this form of temptation actually makes things worse, because the movie makes no effort to set it up resolve it properly. Hellboy extends not even a shred of empathy to any monster he actually encounters."
"4900","At the end of the day, it comes down to the friction between how Hellboy and his adopted father Trevor Brutenholm are characterized and what the movie's moral conflict and resolution turn out to be."
"4901","This line sets up the core drama of the film's climax. The question the movie dramatizes is - will Hellboy follow into his destiny and end the world or does he have free will?"
"4902","So, at last, I have arrived at The Point. The thing that makes Hellboy '19 such a resounding failure is not just that it fails to give the resolution to its core conflict proper justification, it's that every element of the conflict is poorly justified AND contradicts the other."
"4903","This is why I believe they made Brutenholm to be an asshole dad because it gives Hellboy a reason to low key hate humanity in addition to his own demon nature. A reason to be tempted."
"4904","This also explains Hellboy's sudden outburst about monsters maybe having good reason to kill humans. Let's assume that he feels miscast and misjudged by humans on account of his demon nature, and is lashing out because of this. Makes sense."
"4905","Furthermore, his relationship with his human allies is heavily antagonistic for the entirety of the film. Trevor Brutenholm tells Hellboy he loves him to motivate him not to end the world, but at no point does he demonstrate or prove this love."
"4906","There is one thing that the movie does in an attempt to explain why Hellboy would save humanity; true to the comic lore it tells us that he's part human (and also the King of England, but let's not get into that) so I guess he can empathize with them now because he is one."
"4907","Two Problems:
1) The movie has not done the legwork necessary to convince me that to be human is to be empathetic (although I believe it irl). Pretty much every human character is an asshole.
2) This implies that Hellboy didn't find he was human, then so long humanity. Yikes."
"4908","@HellboyMovie my daughter and I just went to see the movie, @DavidKHarbour did an AWESOME job taking on the role, and @MillaJovovich WOW!  ALWAYS a QUEEN in my book, you looked FANTASTIC!  My jaw drops for you <U+0001F632> WELL DONE EVERYONE ! ! !"
"4909","New hellboy did some cool stuff. 
But the sound mixing felt a bit choppy to me. 
Del Toros monster design is probably better too."
"4910","I dunno what I’m smokin compared to all these critics. I thought #Hellboy  was a pretty great modern day b-movie. Lots of laughs, action, and awesome gore. My biggest complaint is I wished they used resin for his horn stumps instead of latex it’s really noticeable"
"4911","#Hellboy was actually really entertaining! People can't go in thinking of the previous movies. It works much better as a darker and bloody movie. #DavidHarbour is perfect in the role!"
"4912","@jade_GREAThello the new hellboy is extremely not good apparently. the del toro hellboy... <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FC>"
"4913","Going to watch: hellboy"
"4914","Ok, but like, the new Hellboy right?  From the get go I told my dad it wouldn't be a good movie, and I was right. The effects were shoddy and worse than the old ones. The plot was everywhere, and overall it left something to be desired. 10/10 would not watch again."
"4915","I can’t understand why we didn’t get a highly stylized HELLBOY movie. That is such a huge part of the charm of the comics."
"4916","somebody stop me from impulse-buying all the Hellboy library editions"
"4917","I love Hellboy idk why theres so much criticisms but oh well i still enjoyed it veryvery much. Yasss"
"4918","This is a big problem for all the live action #hellboy movies.i need to watch the animated versions again."
"4919","@artofmmignola I enjoyed Hellboy and hope it gets a sequel!"
"4920","I mean, it has Hellboy and Abe drinking beers and singing ""Can't smile without you"". This is objectively the best thing.
every movie should have a scene where Hellboy and Abe hang out."
"4921","Heading to the box office, #Shazam tops  with $25.1m. #Little led all newcomers, delivering a $15.5 million in its debut, for a second place finish. #Hellboy struggled in its debut, delivering a mere $12m. A disappointing weekend at the box office."

"4923","Don’t bother even to reply  @_PVRCinemas forget about any action? So is it happening with your consent and asked your employees to loot customers? Pathetic support and business model."
"4924","That being said, the new Hellboy is a collld film"
"4925","@poovenrajj Just wasted RM16.46 on Hellboy (Raj, 2019) #correction <U+0001F923>"

"4928","@HamptureI okay I finally got time to read it during a bowling match.
First off, I kind of love it. 

I went in not knowing what to expect and got a mash of hellboy and SCP with a hint of The Phenomenon."
"4929","Went to see Hellboy last night, a dad and his young child (around 10 I'm terrible with guessing kids ages) was escorted out the screen before it started."
"4930","@Brentosaur I'd have loved another guillermo hellboy film but it was 2004. People need to move on. It's very unfair to shit all over this one just because we didn't get what we wanted 15 years ago"
"4931","Is this really a surprise? Didn’t anyone see Doomsday? Neil Marshall just isn’t that good a director."
"4932","I've been a Hellboy fan since the first movie in 2004, I was 4 years old and I've been reading and collecting the comics ever since. If I see ONE MORE person DARE to hate on the new reboot I swear to God I will smite them. The Reboot wasn't perfect, but is any movie?"
"4933","The reboot was so faithful to the Blood Queen plot, that I noticed a few scenes that were plucked almost right out of the comics! David Harbour did a fantastic job as Hellboy, and it was really cool to see some minor characters on the big screen!"
"4934","@GiteshPandya First it was blade trinity, then pacific rim uprising and now hellboy. Stop taking away movies from @RealGDT."
"4935","@MrPinkPalooka ....ok oddly enough I could see this being a form of hellboy and some darksiders character and that's pretty awesome"
"4936","So, I’m watching hellboy even though I don’t know what is that film all about."
"4937","@mistertodd It could probably beat Hellboy if they brought it back right now."
"4938","This makes me extremely sad. Creative stuff like this is underappriciated while fucking Hellboy gets the views. Ive seen this movie yesterday it was amazing and the stop motion work is spectactular. Looks like nowadays creativity is dead,we need stupidity,gore and boobs in cinema"
"4939","""But Hellboy’s mid-credits scene where Hellboy bumps into Lobster Johnson"" oh i'm getting baited they really put all my favs in what is apparently an absolutely terrible movie"
"4940","Hellboy is a family movie. Your kids will love it"
"4941","I really did not like Hellboy. I found it really boring and felt it was overly edgy with the excessive gore and swearing. I don't have anything against those in general, but that's not what Hellboy is really about."
"4942","@RagiFoesmasher I appreciate this .

Also, Hellboy is a series of miscues and missed opportunities.   

This is not Mignolas Hellboy no matter what Mignola says."
"4943","Yeah I figured Hellboy would lose to Little and Shazam. And I have a feeling Hellboy will sink further down."
"4944","@WargamingDave It was ok, some of the set and creature designs are really nice and Harbour is a great Hellboy but the script is pretty crap and the editing, which is not something that I usually care about, is atrocious"
"4945","Which one is hell boy again fah? Na film??"
"4946","Not that I was super keen to watch the reboot, but it's kind of sad to see that from this review, many others, and comments from friends that the reboot really has wasted the potential it had. *sigh*"

"4956","@utopiacomplex I adore Neil Marshall too. I think Del Toro's work is afforded a huge amount of reverence (rightly so) that has unfortunately led many people to turn against this Hellboy just 'cause it's not THAT Hellboy."
"4957","also the new hellboy movie SUCKED so only go if u wanna laugh"
"4958","@HiTopFilms This is really disappointing since I love David Harbour and had such high hopes.

But now my only hope is that this film is so awful that it somehow prompts boardroom execs into green lighting another installment in the del Toro Hellboy series. One to complete the trilogy."

"4971","#Hellboy is a fascinating mess of a movie. I loved seeing so much of the source material on the big screen, but for people who haven't read the comics it must have been incomprehensible"
"4972","The only cool thing about the new Hellboy movie was the fact that he had a Refused poster in his room"
"4973","and this other boy at work who wont leave me alone realized i wasn’t answering his texts so he sent his sister who works with us a text to ask me if i wanted to see hellboy with him.....NSNSNSMNSKWKS"

I guess it was after all a bad movie lmao."

"4979","@artofmmignola I really enjoyed the new movie, I stayed for the post-credits scenes, too! Just because something is not for everyone, doesn't mean there aren't people who really like it very much. Thank you for creating Hellboy, I love his adventures in every media."
"4980","It was super fun to be apart of this, you can hear all about my thoughts on Hellboy in 4DX."
"4981","I kind of liked the new #Hellboy movie. Sure it had problems but it was fun, messy and entertaining. All I wanted from a Sunday afternoon at the cinema."
"4982","#Hellboy (2019): David Harbour was terrific, almost all the CGI looked unfinished, the piggy was cool, exposition=dialog, Neil Marshall deserved better, and the movie is probably my least favorite of 2019 so far. Or maybe not, either way."
"4983","Hellboy 2 confirmed"

"4988","Well, the new @HellboyMovie has a lot of flaws. But it got me rereading ""Hellboy"" comics by @artofmmignola. Masterpiece *_*"
"4989","@mcbourbonnais1 Two of those three were really good movies. Hellboy wasn't a good movie..."
"4990","@GallagherMW Probably because Hellboy didn’t look like it was going to be good - fans also wanted a part 3, not a reboot - and the film was actually not good at all. I actually want to see Little. Looks funny."
"4991","David Harbour is excellent as #Hellboy &amp; Stephen Graham is ace as Gruagach (I could watch the Scouse mega pig cuss all day long). The film itself has an unforgiving pace &amp; a distinct lack of chemistry amongst its core characters. I liked the gore but it needed more heart. 2/5."

"4994","Don't mind me while I watch Del Toro's Hellboy 2 on repeat all week to get the bad taste of the new film out of my mouth."
"4995","@Polygon Hellboy 3 would have ""cost too much"" so they rebooted on a low budget &amp; produced a CGI heavy, absurdly gory swear-fest that is mostly forgettable. 
The Studio should have given Del Toro the money; they would have stood a chance of some return, rather than a 76% loss."

I needs to look closer at handles."
"5027","@jamie_graham9 Ok it sounds like it’s worth checking out. The trouble is Del Toro has a very unique touch, which isn’t necessarily accurate to how Hellboy is perceived in the graphic novels, which adapts very nicely to the screen. Best to go in thinking it’s a totally different approach I think"
"5028","@jamie_graham9 I actually like the look of the new Hellboy from the trailer plus I really like Neil Marshall’s movies including the overlooked Doomsday. Is it as bad as some reviews suggest?"
"5029","@Bones_OG @MarkSands_ @Landontours Hellboy is so bad it’s good. Shazam is surprisingly decent and enjoyable."
"5030","Just watched the new hellboy. That leopard. O bby."
"5031","#Hellboy is amazing, growing up being fascinated with the supernatural &amp; monsters &amp; having a universe I could visit was such a support, so thank you Mike Mignola. #ReadHellboy, the universe is so rich, with amazing story telling and phenomenal art!"
"5032","Okay...

My novel will be finished in the next 36 hours... (approx.)

But off to see Hellboy first and maybe play some video games... and also quickly go into work...

And oh yes, I need to still plan a little how that final chapter will play out.

"5086","Oh yeah. My thoughts on the new Hellboy. I enjoyed it. I thought the writing was all over the place.  The pace was weird.  But I fucking enjoyed it. I liked it. There’s A mid credit scene and a post credit scene that is very important. 6/10."
"5087","About to listen to @FromSuperheroes #Hellboy episode on my way to work. Considering the reviews it's been getting, this should be...interesting. @Ivimey @WordsOfDiana"
"5088","Del Toro treated Hellboy, not as a testosterone driven super-hero (although we did get some of that with the cigar-smoking, gun-wielding Hellboy), but also as a complex creature, struggling with his own sense of self. Kind of like us."
"5089","Back to HELLBOY: Del Toro's HELLBOY worked so well, because he layered the action/adventure of the film with the story of Hellboy's conscience. @perlmutations's refined performance complimented that style of storytelling."
"5090","The film shows us the monster within ourselves (Hellboy's transmutation into Anung un Rama). With the help of his friends, Hellboy defeats the monstrous within himself in order to protect others."
"5091","@DVDBits Thank god you are the only review not stuck in nostalgia and not realising it’s a fairy good film the Mexico part straight out of hellboy in Mexico it’s a horror movie in the sense of resident evil is a horror"
"5092","@MarkEWest I think there was a two year gap between the two films. Neither made any money and Hellboy has stiffed by the sounds of it from the studio ballsing up the filming. I imagine it will all come out but he'll be the focus because he directed it."
"5093","@Rukario71 Awesome. Let me know how it is. I haven't actually seen any of the Hellboy movies"
"5094","I just saw Hellboy (2019) it was mostly bad but the sequence with the giants was cool."

If I like it I’ll watch it, if not I’ll skip it.

Apparently Hellboy was supposed to be released in January."
"5101","@Toonforbrains Naw, that’s for Hellboy.

"5129","@filmism to be fair it's not really his fault the movie is a mess.  he barely directed it.  16 producers were in charge and pissed him off.  there's a reason why he's not even promoting Hellboy or was at the premiere."
"5130","@suesuesbeo9 The guy playing Hellboy has an odd, hight nor voice for a ""demon."" I think a lot of fans were turned off by that right away. But the movie also was reported as having a lot of reshoots and problems, so it got bad buzz."

"5137","I don't know if it's because it's without Ron Perlman or because its a schlocky sequel but the writer Owen Gleiberman is always worth his reviews, they are great."
"5138","@joyboy700 @HellboyMovie me and Clint went Friday, it’s so wack"
"5139","@SuperSuitShow @MasterAkaJAck I disagree because hellboy actually fought several comic accurate villains. While the movie had many missteps it at least had the hero doing something. Fan4stic just had the heroes standing around doing nothing."
"5140","@midtowner33 @perlmutations They should have let Guillermo and Ron do a third. Nothing against the new guy playing Hellboy but rebooting just wasn't needed."
"5141","TFW you crimp on your much more successful siblings success."
"5142","@HellboyMovie Thanks for bringing so much of MM’s work to the screen. I was thoroughly entertained."
"5143","@DaltonRoss  Lots of word of mouth about Hellboy... It’s Terrible"
"5144","Currently reading the #Hellboy comic. It's pretty damn strong and my personal favourite comic book at the moment.

"5147","I didn't enjoy this new #HellboyMovie

Hollywood thinks by throwing in 1 person of colour and 1 Asian will automatically give them a box office hit"
"5148","Dumbo has returned to the top purely thanks to the holidays- here’s the latest box office top 5."
"5149","The new Hellboy movie unfortunately is right there"
"5150","@spacedrugs and he was very excited for the direction of this film and like man, I cannot believe that's the case. This feels so un-Hellboy and against character, just sad all the way around."
"5151","hellboy is one of the worst movies ever and the second one sucked just as bad. sorry to nerds. Pan's Labyrinth rules."
"5152","Urgent!!
Barnstaple

We have had to cancel three showings tonight due to a technical issue! If you pop in to the cinema we will be happy to exchange these tickets for another film/ day. 

we are sorry for the inconvenience.

Showings cancelled are:
Hellboy @ 15:20, 18:00 &amp; 20:40."
"5153","@JoeyLDG Yeah, and sadly now those sentiments, coupled with a perplexing release window (this is such an October movie) are adding up to numbers that are looking like we'll get NO Hellboy after this. Save us, China?"
"5154","AND THEN i still want to watch dumbo, shazam, pet semetery, Hellboy ALL of which r currently occupying the theatres atm BUT I'm home alone w/ the sister n the entrep fair just stole my money n we still gotta save for japan huhu y does everything have to happen on my birthmonth"
"5155","I am not a discriminating movie consumer. I'm willing to give a lot of movies a pass because I like something about them - an actor, set design, costumes, something. The new Hellboy? Not that movie. Avoid. Don't waste your time or money."
"5156","Hellboy is a weird movie...some parts felt like a parody others were insanely gory and class <U+0001F602><U+0001F602>

Anyone else saw it yet ?"
"5157","Last night I saw Hellboy and it made me really, really miss my old Changeling buddies. I *would* pay money to get that good thing back."
"5158","Oh dang I just finished the podcast and you enjoyed it

I'm kind of surprised. I'm usually hecka nice to ""bad"" movies but... It was like the guys who made the live action Scooby Doo movies got the Hellboy license and said ""let's just make it a gorefest"""
"5159","@NandovMovies I saw Hellboy this weekend and it is the worst movie I've seen in quite some time"
"5160","@IndieWire I like a lot of the ‘Marvel Comics Universe’ movies but the work of @RealGDT on The Hellboy movies and Blade 2 makes them my favourite comic book adaptations. So much imagination with a universe more akin to Harry Potter’s than MCU (I mean that in a positive way!)."
"5161","@Unphiltereddd I genuinely believe we've been so spoilt by great comic book movies in the last few years that people have forgotten what a bad one actually looks like, and pounce on the less than perfect ones as ""The worst thing ever!""

Thank God Hellboy is around to remind people..."
"5162","When the cinema attendant is being cheeky with u :-

Me : *Passed the ticket for Hellboy to the attendant*

Attendant : You must be 18+ to watch the movie

Me : *walks away with a huge grin on my face*"
"5163","People out there really making Venom a box office hit but letting Hellboy bomb? If you want to go see a cinematic mess, at least go see the interesting one. (to be fair, Hellboy's release date didn't help either)"
"5164","@MillaJovovich Readin through what u put on Instagram and agree with not taking the negativity.Then I saw the descent and you got me sold.Awesome movie same with the sequel. Plus what'll make hellboy a blast to watch through taking Ian McShane and David Harbour out of the equation is ur in it."
"5165","So Hellboy tanked at the box office. This comes as a surprise exactly why? No Hellboy movie fan I know wanted a reboot, they wanted another Guillermo del Toro, Ron Pearlman film."
"5166","Leftovers
- I &lt;3 D.Harb and wish I could see him through the makeup/script, tho even the vets in the cast deliver (assumedly intentional) ham + cheese
- The speed it attempts to bank the Hellboy mythos is dizzying, the merl-cave was like someone holding fast forward on a remote"
"5167","@wyattyhalpert Or because not all R rated film become Deadpool. Or because a ton of people don’t know or want to know Hellboy. Even GDT didn’t make a lot of money with him."
"5168","Who will be the first contrarian weirdo on my timeline to claim that the new Hellboy movie is better than Spider-Verse or something"
"5169","@DieRobinsonDie Hellboy muttering along with a horny slow jam...actually this works perfectly"
"5170","@DieRobinsonDie Weird as fuck animated Hellboy sounds cool, we’ll probably get that someday even if this movie bombed on every level. Those are the rules now"
"5171","@IndieWire Interesting take, and I'd probably make the case that the first of this type was ""The Crow"" - but I'd also argue that say this is not the last of it's kind.  Everything comes in cycles. The reaction to the new Hellboy and even this article shows the early signs of renewed demand"
"5172","@TheTalkingCan I couldn't care less about Hellboy"

"5175","Might see the new #Hellboy just to see how bad it is"
"5176","i went to see Hellboy and it was absolutely fucking bananas. astonishing that it got made. Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent) still rules and his signature gore was incredible but my god i still cant wrap my head around what i saw"
"5177","I haven't seen the new Hellboy, so I can't make a real statement about the quality of the movie. However, I do feel any comic book based movie that doesn't have the Marvel Studios logo at the beginning starts behind the 8 ball for most critics."
"5178","I repeat *definitely not on fire*"
"5179","@DylanRoth I haven’t actually seen Hellboy but I assume it has an original Post Malone song too"
"5180","@DylanRoth Hellboy: Into the Helliverse"

"5182","In which @bexlectric goes to hell (boy)..."
"5183","At the theater to see the new Hellboy and I'm the only person here. Based on the reviews I've heard about this film, I'm not surprised."
"5184","@Mike_J_Lord Abe has his own comics. I wonder if they were thinking of a Hellboy universe and perhaps Abe's origin story, as a separate entity. Unfortunately, nowadays, they seem to evade tone decisions, hoping to appeal to 'everyone' which ends up satisfying no-one.
They all want ""$1b""..."
"5185","@TibiTogor @BobDigi69 i have read some and i should re read some volumes i have, however, like all of these cbm we are watching the movie. Whether they follow straight from the material or not, ultimately, how is the movie on its own? On it's own, this #Hellboy is kick ass"
"5186","Saw Hellboy last night and I didn't think it was awful. It was good, but really not the best and we mainly just entertaining which is all I expected so I can't hate on it."
"5187","@DylanRoth @DieRobinsonDie There are some animated Hellboy specials on DVD, though I don't think they go as weird as they could."
"5188","sooo why did I agree to watch Hellboy again HAHAHUHU pucha"
"5189","brief nerdy thread:
 was texting with my (out of town) wife about maybe going to see Captain Marvel tonight.She replied with a sad emoji, so I replied ""maybe I'll go see 'Hellboy' or 'Captain Marvel' instead"" #nerdproblems #captainMarvel"
"5190","@Rukario71 Tell me how you like it! If you do. X3

My whole family loves the Hellboy movies Toro made but this remake seems iffy."
"5191","@jamie_graham9 From what i’ve heard, it has the potential of a “so bad it’s good” movie.  I’m a big fan of Hellboy so i’ll go see it, but pretty much all the reviews/comments i’ve read so far are not positive"
"5192","@real_movie25 where is the new hellboy movie"
"5193","@BudFugate The GOT one more recently. Another one last week on the new Hellboy."
"5194","The man at the cinema asked to see my ID, he thought I was 16! I hope Hellboy is worth it <U+0001F602><U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"5195","im seeing this afternoon but if i had to guess im going to say critics refuse to contextualize movies and think just bc it's goofy or over the top it's stupid and bad"
"5196","@GentlemanBrawlr @HellboyMovie @DaveBautista Not a Hellboy fan but how was it?  I'm not going to turn away if I ever see it on  regular TV or Streaming services."
"5197","New #Hellboy flick is great. Maybe folk don’t like it because it’s actually true to the spirit of the comics, the main actor keeps his makeup on the whole time, the humour actually works as it fits the tone of the setting and it’s not about sycophantic celebrity worship and merch"
"5198","The Corpse is rightly still considered one of the best Hellboy stories, but the Chained Coffin has an eeriness to it that I think still stands unmatched. Part of that is definitely because the whole thing is a nightmare Hellboy can't punch his way out of."
"5199","@GilbyRanger The new one? Because if so, I was totally expecting it to be bad. I don't think anyone could play hellboy better than Ron Pearlman  anyway."
"5200","@Dryl I hope David Harbour sticks around to play the character for a while because he really felt right for Hellboy a second time around."
"5201","I don't feel bad that Hellboy bombed this weekend, the creator basically pushed out GDT because he wanted a darker rated R version. You should have let Del Toro finish his trilogy like most of the fans wanted and rebooted it later down the road."
"5202","The thing about a Hellboy is, go read the comics. They are amazing. Read all the Mignola stuff. Read all the Guy Davis stuff. Read all the Duncan Fegredo stuff. Read for damn sure the Richard Corben stuff. The movies don’t matter. This character was born for comics. Read them."
"5203","One of our greatest historians, hellboy, has figured out why trump is the tyrant he is...because of the size of his dong. <U+0001F611> let me add this got over 5000 likes. I want off now please. This crazy train is exhausting."
"5204","Hmm I don't think the new Hellboy is the worst movie ever, but man, there's whole bunch of bad cgi or like meh plot in there that covers up some of the okay one so. The best part of this movie is how hot shirtless Daniel Dae Kim tbh."
"5205","I completely forgot they made a new Hellboy movie. Did anyone see it?
#MondayMorning"
"5206","Just bavk for watching Hellboy @cineworld parkhead. Really enjoyed it."
"5207","Since I’ve been growing my hair and beard out I’ve been told I look like -
Thor, Aquaman, a Viking and, Hellboy. I wonder what’s next <U+0001F914><U+0001F914>"
"5208","@LotharHex @Dryl I also do not recall Ron Pearlman removing his makeup in either Hellboy that he was in or seeing very much in the way of merchandising."
"5209","@perlmutations Hellboy without you? That was the first mistake - of many...."
"5210","@KingFahad360 I think I’ll hate Hellboy but I have to see how it turns out"
"5211","lmfao, seeing these reactions to David Harbour's statement that the new Hellboy can't have sex with humans. It makes me wonder if he's underestimated or is uncomfortable with the extreme THIRST the internet's Monster Fuckers have for him. #Hellboy"
"5212","Six hours left on this one question poll for next weeks movie and I would love all you fine folks input (:"
"5213","""All my raddest films have been slammed by critics. Every one of those films is now a cult classic. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. And this will be too. Mark my words.""

Love this. And honestly, I think she's spot on here. #Hellboy"
"5214","@BradWiswall Tell that to Hellboy"
"5215","@BDisgusting And honestly, she gives probably her best performance ever in Hellboy. Like she was a real stand out. I was surprised and impressed."
"5216","all her films have been slammed to be fair (not counting dazed and confused)"
"5217","@perlmutations Bruh you dipped on Hellboy stfu."
"5218","One of the reasons I’ve always liked Milla. She does what she wants in terms of projects."
"5219","@perlmutations is it ridiculous that I want to see you in a role as beauty and the hellboy that leads a biker gang?"
"5220","Just about to watch Hellboy at the cinema.

Interestingly, there are 7 members of staff in the foyer doing nothing and only one on the kiosk. Anyone else wanna jump on to serve the people waiting? No? Okay, cool. Just checking."
"5221","Hmmmm. Whilst the RT review reveal was hideously done, Milla has mostly made a lot of pretty average to awful films. The Resident Evil films, whilst hugely profitable are in large terrible. Ultraviolet anyone? She can be and is great - her films aren't."
"5222","Honestly , I personally felt like Hellboy is quite draggy. Almost fell asleep in the cinema yesterday - Idk how the human enjoyed <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"5223","Hearing Hellboy isn't actually THAT bad and that critics overdid the negativity. As a result it bombed at the box office.
Shame"
"5224","Juat saw the new #Hellboy. It's sloppily assembled and screams of different people wanting different things, BUT it's not terrible. It's just a dumb b-movie with some good creature design."
"5225","No but I need you all to know that #Hellboy was a really bad movie."
"5226","@ShahirDaud @Johnathanblade @onlymoviepod Leave the Godfather.

Take the Aquaman.

I want a cannoli now.

Also: HELLBOY."
"5227","hellboy really does just run around in bike shorts and a trenchcoat huh"
"5228","are either pet semetary or hellboy things i should see regardless of terrible ratings or should i just give up"
"5229","Looks like the new Hellboy movie didn't perform well over the weekend.  While I'm sad for @artofmmignola, I'm happy for @perlmutations who wanted to do another Hellboy movie so bad, and no one would let him."
"5230","When you don't realize you are a b movie actress."
"5231","@perlmutations I agree, Jake's not a smart man. Good catch there, hellboy."
"5232","Here we go my official ranking of the #Hellboy movies

1. Hellboy II: The Golden Army
2. Hellboy (2004)
3. Not Watching Hellboy
4. Hellboy (2019)"
"5233","@GTCprod From what I hear from *rveryone* its almost like a contractual obligation flick, no real care or character or plot or connective tissue, just a necessary amount of Hellboy related scenes to fill a feature run time"
"5234","Hellboy is so bad not even the media pirates want to touch it"
"5235","I'm probably going to bite the bullet and go to check out #Hellboy tonight... Wish me luck! @HellboyMovie"
"5236","@kirkneverdied I don’t think it’s too surprising. Knew Hellboy would flop. I’m also not shocked with Missing Link. I think a big issue is the marketing, but I also don’t think there’s a huge demand for stop-motion."
"5237","*sigh* I think she was fantastic in it. Loved the entire film too. #millajovovich #hellboy @MillaJovovich #hellboy2019"
"5238","@GMCpodcast Like I said in my tweets. If you want some mindless fun with a very convoluted story that doesn't make a lot of sense then it will be fun but if your expecting the second coming of Hellboy you're gonna be disappointed.  It's a mess even if it's entertaining at times."
"5239","we watched hellboy last night and the fish boy is cute"
"5240","Maybe I'm wrong. But I can't imagine Hellboy 3 with Guillermo del Toro performing as bad as the new Hellboy, did this weekend at the box office. I'm sure the studio wishing they went in that direction now."
"5241","I try to ignore reviews and make my own decisions, but in this case I should have listened. Hellboy really is a pile of wank."
"5242","@CoyJandreau Comic fan and horror fan

Loved the new Hellboy it delivered the kind of entertainment I’m always seeking...FUN!"
"5243","Has anyone gone to see the Hellboy reboot? Is it worth the watch?"
"5244","So #Hellboy pulled in $10 million from 41 territories, taking its worldwide start to $22 million. Eh sure whatever.

The surprise is #LittleMovie pulled in $15 million. That's a bad Black Adam Sandler movie...there's that many people who said that's worth opening weekend $$?!!"
"5245","@Dragonstare1 @LetsTalkVivian Hellboy just gets sick one day and starts vomiting up his children."
"5246","I gotta say...

I expected Shazam to do bigger numbers. This is great, overall. But I vastly underestimated how the scaled-down spectacle would prevent the film from being an absolute smash.

Love the movie. Happy for a sequel. But this is a little more tepid than I expected."
"5247","Hellboy is a nightmare cowboy. He is both the horse and the rider. He wears a duster and drinks whiskey from the bottle and is a hell of a shot and sorry babe, he's gotta move on. You could make a dozen great Hellboy movies by remaking classic westerns. He's not a superhero."
"5248","@DreadCentral It sucked, that's why.

Hellboy has been nerfed. He's no longer the presence he was. 

Quite sad."
"5249","@MadAboutMovies Yeah there is just a very limited audience interested in a Hellboy remake and the majority of people are just ready for the Avengers to get here. Putting Shazam between Captain Marvel and the Avengers was an interesting choice. I probably would have moved that up to January."
"5250","@DreadCentral They are trend surfing. Every month there is a new game, movie or show that is cool to shit on even if it doesn't deserve it. This time around it is Hellboy."
"5251","Oh dang, forgot to say I liked the new Hellboy movie. The theater was really empty tho. : ("
"5252","That's facts."
"5253","I have a full thesis draft due in a week but all I’m doing is planning when I can see Hellboy."
"5254","Whole lot of people online unhappy because the new Hellboy is different from the Ron Perlman / GDT version. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed those movies, but they're not the source material!"
"5255","You hate to see it"
"5256","Hey @manticgames - really shoddy delivery for a £200 game - Hellboy dropped off 2 miles away at post office despite asking parcelforce not to. @parcelforce accepted and confirmed redelivery then went ahead and did whatever they wanted. I can't collect it. Suggestions?!!"

"5269","I went and saw Hellboy, you cowards!  It somehow has the most exposition ever spoken in a Hollywood film while still being a confusing gory blur of punching. Its mystifyingly terrible while nearly being great. made no goddamn sense at all. I couldn’t look away.Highly recommended!"

"5276","@DreadCentral Because people can't appreciate someone else's vision of Hellboy just because Perlman wasn't in it. Boo hoo. Get over it people. I loved Del Toros version just as much as the next person. But its time to move on"
"5277","Did anybody see Hellboy and can you confirm it's a pile of trash?"
"5278","@DreadCentral A huge Part of the originals charm was @perlmutations the new #HellBoy was hideous to look at. That’s just for starters."
"5279","HOT TAKE: Hellboy would be a great movie for The Last Drive-In."
"5280","@HellboyMovie U sure about that fam"
"5281","I'm not opposed to Neil Marshall style cinematic carnage as DOOMSDAY is probably top ten for me but when I heard the new Hellboy would be foul mouthed and hard R that was a real red flag as the source material is rarely  either of those things."
"5282","There was reportedly serious drama behind the scenes of The new #Hellboy movie."
"5283","She looked bored throughout the whole movie."
"5284","@DcCringe I'm sorry but I hated Hellboy. That's why I refuse to see it."
"5285","@mollyrockit GDT/Perlman Hellboy got me into the comics, which I read religiously. I was apprehensive about the reboot, and it did have some good moments, but it ultimately did an AWFUL job of getting ME!!!! of all people, to root for HB!"
"5286","The difference between Dark Pheonix and Hellboy 2019 is that Dark Pheonix is a trainwreck that looks hella fun."
"5287","HellBoy wasn't fantastic but it wasn't terrible either. It was enjoyable. This was a movie based off the comics. Wonder what people were expecting."
"5288","""I Hated Hellboy. That's why I refuse to see it."" Makes sense."
"5289","#crespohundo2019 35 #Hellboy was fun and sexy. But the poor CG could of used another $5mil. The editing could of tighten up some of it. But i am sucker for #daddyissues and david did a really good job. If i get more of him and alice i wouldnt be mad! Diverse cast is great too!"
"5290","I hate posts like this, that scold people when there are so many other factors. I go to hundreds of movies per year. Many do less $$$ than this movie. This movie was not appealing to me. The last two Laikas I didn't like.Hellboy, a franchise, also bombed this weekend."
"5291","@FreddyInSpace I have said it once and I will continue to stand by it. #Hellboy is and will be a cult classic, regardless of reviews. I had so much fun watching that movie, I would watch it again in a heart beat."
"5292","@GameSpot It wasn’t bad, never fully cared for hellboy but not a bad movie"
"5293","Have you not made enough money from past #RifftraxLive movies to justify airing the lastest ones? Are you going to make more money on Thursday night airing Hellboy, Pet Sematary or The Best of Enemies vs. airing #RifftraxLive?  11/"
"5294","Our review of Pet Sematary is now up! What did Dylan and I think of this remake? Listen to find out! Also, be looking for our reviews of Shazam and Hellboy coming soon (hopefully)."
"5295","So, My guesses for the 3 released movie RT scores were all awful.
My box office predictions were pretty weak too. At least I was right that Hellboy is going to bomb. But it might bomb even worse than I expected!"
"5296","Maybe I'm still a teenage boy at heart or maybe bad reviews realigned my expectations, but I really heckin' liked the new Hellboy movie. It is a dumb, gory, fun action/horror movie and decidedly NOT a del Toro flick, and that is okay."
"5297","Things I liked less than Hellboy:
- every recent Oscar movie (except for Black Panther and BlackkKlansmen)
- Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman
- The first two Thor movies
- Last night's episode of Game of Thrones"
"5298","@EmmaBullimore And let’s ignore the diabolical Hellboy which even SG can’t save!!"
"5299","@indiasey HELLBOY is getting some tough reviews, in the way that makes me think it is really poorly crafted. Which is disappointing. Mignola’s comic work is fabulous. I want to see it, as a fan, but I’m nervous too."
"5300","@EmilyKinsell I'd say that all is revealed by watching Hellboy, but then you'd actually have to watch Hellboy."
"5301","@screenrant I can sit there and enjoy Venom, The Meg, &amp; Hellboy. I’m not saying their these really good movies but more enjoyable popcorn flicks. What the new Hellboy has that the others dont is it didn’t hold back for a younger audience."
"5302","@Dryl Saying that though, really enjoyed the other four too. Basically just love me some Hellboy, I guess."
"5303","I’ll flounder for half that"
"5304","So now that the new Hellboy is a flop, can we just get a third #Hellboy movie done by @RealGDT with @perlmutations ???#justiceforhellboy"
