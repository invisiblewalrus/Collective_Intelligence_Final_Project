"15","#TheHauntingOfSharonTate is so Beautiful yet Scary at the same time! Watch it with an opened mind. The film takes place in a alternate universe. It’s told through Sharon Tate’s eyes, seeing life through “rose colored glasses” as she was quoted as saying. I cried at the end!"
"16","#TheHauntingOfSharonTate is a good movie @HilaryDuff did a great job in her 1st horror flick! Felt good seeing her back in a movie where she's the main character <U+0001F60A><U+0001F499><U+0001F499> #Life #GottaLoveIt"

#PetSematary

#TheHauntingOfSharonTate

#UnicornStore (Netflix Original)"
"45","Not a fan of alternate-history movies anyway but #TheHauntingOfSharonTate seems to cross the line for me. Even if it’s a good movie (haven’t watched), Sharon Tate deserves more than an opportunistic horror made in her name."
"46","@HilaryNews @HilaryDuff @JonathanBennett @LydiaHearst @WTylerJohnson @p_sza @VoltagePictures @ETAFilms @gmtfilms @farrands1 @JorGarciaC @HauntingOfTate I was curious about that?! I went to check the post out and saw no comments. Said to myself “people getting mean”."
"47","Seriously can’t wait to see this movie! To see @HilaryDuff play a role like this is exciting. 

I hope all you haters check it out before you bash it. People be jealous of others success."
"48","Im waiting for @chiefer91 to get home so we can watch this together. Since the @Mariners have played already today <U+0001F618>"
"49","THE HAUNTING OF SHARON TATE really took me by surprise.  What could have been a cheap gimmick turned out to be a melancholic twist on a cultural touchstone.  Check out more in my review."
"50","@DuffPictures @HilaryDuff @HauntingOfTate @LydiaHearst @ETAFilms @sabanfilms @VoltagePictures Where? I find no info on where and how I can see it"
"51","@JonathanBarkan Stop spreading negative hate on the Haunting Of Sharon Tate!!! Being limited to certain story lines or productions that aren’t in your personal Taste doesn’t mean the film is bad! I’m sorry @HauntingOfTate didn’t pay you enough for a positive review like other big directors!!!"
"52","@HauntingOfTate Who needs harsh Critics when When the voice of the Audience is more important! I find the harsh reviews are based on their lack of knowledge on Sharons documented Dream, and the positive ones are actually based on their options on the film and in what universe it takes place in."
"53","@FamShore @HauntingOfTate I never got paid? And my whole job is centered around horror and thrillers, so I'm deeply embedded in this world."
"54","@HauntingOfTate hi! Can i ask you if i want to watch on video demand online which official website or app should i use?"

"58","@HauntingOfTate i’ll stick to respecting the wishes of Debra Tate"
"59","Did Sharon Tate actually sound like this or what is the voice Hilary Duff is doing? #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"60","Sharon Tate just killed Tex Perkins? I'm pretty sure that didn't happen... #thehauntingofsharontate"
"61","how can you do a movie about a real murder and change the ending like that????
#TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"62","mind blown.
#TheHauntingOfSharonTate just twists everything madly. i hope younger people don't think this is in any way a true account of things. while it has been said she had visions/dreams beforehand that is about the only semi truth to be found"
"63","planning to watch #TheHauntingOfSharonTate today.
i expect it to be a bit cheesy. i hope i am pleasantly surprised.
i just hope it is respectful"
"64","#TheHauntingOfSharonTate 

really this movie is a train wreck. if it was total fiction then okay but this is just a terrible, twisted tale of what never happened."

"71","bout to watch #TheHauntingOfSharonTate don’t @ me..."
"72","A lot of Sharon Tate films about at the moment."
"73","Prepare for @LydiaHearst and @JonathanBennett to amaze you!! Such a trippy - and horrifyingly frightening - film!!"
"74","I tried with this one as I was looking forward to it, but found the lead to be to distracting and off-putting."
"75","Theater showings!!"
"76","anyway im gonna stop ranting now and just say i enjoyed this wayyyyy more than i expected, it is nowhere near the worst depiction ive seen of this and i dont agree with yall in the slightest 6.8/10 #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"77","saying high castle is about nazis winning so its tasteless and wrong... on top of that hillary duff gives the best performance ive seen her give(admittedly im not hugely familiar with her whole catalogue)... ive also heard people it provides nothing new #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"78","which is not accurate almost all the films and interpretations of this event are told with focus on charlie, the murderers(tex and the girls) and the family... this focuses on the victim/s spoilers who are not victims here...  #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"79","yo know what... ive been watching ppl dumping on this movie for a couple of days.. and im gonna have to be the dissenting opinion here... this is not an accurate representation, its alt history, states itself as such and should be regarded as such  #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"80","the message of which is no one is fated to be a victim, and that we are in a time and place where women and victims will fight back and win against those who try to brutalize them... most of criticism i see around this movie is about as deep as #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
"81","Trying to watch #TheHauntingOfSharonTate but the obnoxious self centered ho has a problem with it cause she think shes everything! :D
You dumb duck, let it go!"
"82","@HauntingOfTate @ETAFilms @sabanfilms @VoltagePictures @HilaryDuff @JonathanBennett @LydiaHearst Watched i last night on On Demand and really disliked it."
"83","@HauntingOfTate @iTunes Will it be released on DVD at all?"
"84","#TheHauntingofSharonTate appears to be one big existential crisis for Tate (Duff)"
"85","#TheHauntingOfSharonTate gave Sharon a fighting chance. It ends the way the events ended in real life, but the story gave her a chance to fight back, even if it wasn’t what really happened. Let’s all chill out and just say it’s a bad movie cause it’s just bad lol."
"86","When I saw “wolves at the door” I felt like <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> it’s not enough I want more depth into it... now this <U+0001F60D> #cantwait"
"87","@JeffYorkWriter @HauntingOfTate @DanielFarrands @CreativeScreen I'm sorry I can't make it out how people called this piece of garbage 'a disturbing true crime thriller'. There's nothing true about it, it's a pure fictional exploitation movie."
"88","@HauntingOfTate @ETAFilms @sabanfilms @VoltagePictures @HilaryDuff @JonathanBennett @LydiaHearst To all of those involved. Shame on you. This disgusting twisted made up take on what REALLY HAPPENED is beyond comprehension. I hope you get sued for this mishmash of out and out lies. What a piece of trash."
"89","@GaymerPS4 @HauntingOfTate What documented dream? That is a bunch of bullshit. Maybe it is YOU who needs to stop listening to crap. I know everything about this case inside and out and NONE of those victims had an inkling of what was to happen. Talk to her sister sometime."
"90","@LondonHorrorSoc @HauntingOfTate You are out of your f'ing mind. Steven Parent NEVER worked at Cielo. He was at the wrong place at the wrong time and I hope the Parent family sues the pants off this so called director. So many things that NEVER happened. Piece of junk."
"91","Sorry for all the @HilaryDuff spam I just love her and this new movie shes in called #TheHauntingOfSharonTate and I cant get enough of it. I promise I’m done... for now. <U+263A><U+FE0F> goodnight friends."
"92","Finally watched @HauntingOfTate and i absolutely LOVED it... took me awhile to understand what was happening but i absolutely loved the directors take on #CharlesManson and #mansonfamilymurders #Cielo #hauntingofsharontate @HilaryDuff performance was stunning #sharontate"
"93","@HauntingOfTate someone posted the movie on youtube"
"94","I'm so proud of my baby @HilaryDuff what a movie<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB> congrats!!! This film is amazing, we need it in Mexico!!!"
"95","@nogutsnopodcast Minimalistic storytelling and feels either like a made for TV movie or one of my college videos from 20+ years ago (only not as good) #thehauntingofsharontate #charlesmanson #hilaryduff"

"100","@HilaryDuff @HauntingOfTate The Haunting of Sharon Tate was actually way better than I expected n I love the twist at the end so much fun to watch <U+2764>"
"101","I don't know why so many are hating on #thehauntingofsharontate. Sure they took great liberties. But, it gave the victims' perspective on that fateful night. Most movies focus on #manson &amp; family. Plus, what's wrong with a ""what if"" scenario thrown in at the end. I liked it."
"102","There is apparently a movie called #TheHauntingOfSharonTate... I will need to see this."

"111","extremely interesting subject though.. while i dont think the movie fully works in other aspects.. the idea that we can reimagine and reconstruct the 50yr media portrayal of ""helpless"" into ""fighter"" just once, even if only in fiction, is a powerful one  #TheHauntingOfSharonTate"
